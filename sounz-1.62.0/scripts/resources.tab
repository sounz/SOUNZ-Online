Alfred Hill was New Zealand's first fully professional composer and a leading figure in Australian music from the early years of this century.

Far more than the life and times of its subject, it is a vivid recreation of the Victorian and Edwardian eras in Australia and New Zealand, and paints portraits of the cultural growth of two nations.

This publication brings together three superb guides in one volume. 'Lullaby for Matthew', a short "romantic" piece for piano (about Grade 5) by one of Aotearoa's most important composers, explores the variation form as a composiï¿½tional tool. John Psathas is one of New Zealand's most exciting composers, and his evocative piano work 'Waiting for the Aeroplane' provides a basis for the study of Greek music and Jazz. Commercial recordings of 'Lullaby for Matthew' and 'Waiting for the Aeroplane' are available on the CD 'You Hit Him He Cry Out' (Dan Poynton); 'Waiting for the Aeroplane' is also available on 'Rhythm Spike' (Dan Poynton). Both CDs are available from SOUNZ. David Hamilton is arguably New Zealand's foremost choral composer. His 'Rakiura', for SATB choir, is based on a play by Eileen Philipp and tells, in the style of a Noh drama, the story of a Japanese woman found living in a cave on Stewart Island. A recording is included on the SOUNZWRITE choral CD, which also includes Hamilton's 'Lux Aeterna' for comparative listening.
