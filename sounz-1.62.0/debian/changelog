 -- Pete Black <pete@catalyst.net.nz>  Tue, 5 Feb 2008 12:08:00 +1300

sounz (1.12.0) stable; urgency=low
  * WR#50406 - Scilla's note of 05/02/2008: Role title is added to 
    Person name line, organisation name is displayed on separate line - 
    for labels.[liuba]
  * WR#50406 - 	Implement new mailout contact scheme - small addition:
    'Person' role title is not written into the database.[liuba]
  * WR#51754 - Reindexing of Associated Objects in SOLR after a Deletion
    [liuba]
  * Replaced object.solr_save by object.save in 
    RelationshipHelper.add_frbr_relationship and 
    RelationshipHelper.destroy_relationship_and_update_solr, so that
    after_save method of frbr_observer.rb is called for solr updates of
    associated objects. [liuba]
  * WR#51065 - MANIFESTATION CODE - display on manifestation show page with 
    main category - added manifestation code and Work main category (for 
    scores only) to be displayed in Admin Only section of Manifestation 
    display page; small fixes in display of labels in Admin Only section.
    Also, added Work main category (for scores only) to be displayed after 
    manifestation code on Manifestation edit page [liuba] 
  * WR#51702 - Umbrella events (those with 'children' events) are treated 
    differently - their finish date is not indexed in solr for facets 
    search (starting date is indexed as finished date instead - the same 
    processing as for events without finish date needed for facets), so 
    that they are not shown in facets as happening on every day of the 
    date range. 
    IMPORTANT: Event model requires solr indexes to be rebuild for that change.
    [liuba]
  * WR#51905 - CRM - clicking on role/contact info break - role contactinfos 
    affected are those of people's roles in organisations where 'postal'
    role_contactinfo did not exist, provoked by the import of organisations 
    without creating 3 sets of role_contactinfos, added processing to create 
    appropriate (missing) role_contactinfo for organisation primary role in
    default_contactinfos_update method of role.rb - this fixes the bug. 
    [liuba] 
  * WR#51883 - SONLINE  - selected results working selectively - fixed a bug
    where selected results in session were displayed only to not-logged-users
    [liuba]
  * WR#51881 - WORK UPDATE FORM - break when pressing submit - breakage was
    caused by the call to the incorrect model in show confirmation - fixed. 
    [liuba]
  * WR#51853 - TAP - works - display of difficulty note - added Difficulty
    Note section to Works show page. [liuba]
  * Sorted person's roles in person's role list (Person Edit, Roles pages)
    The sorting order is: person Person role followed by person roles by 
    role name in alphabetical ascending order. [liuba]
  * WR#51725 - CRM - ordering of contacts on organistion page - organisation
    roles are now displayed in special order - general organisation role,
    followed by organisation roles without people in alphabetical ascending
    order of role name and then, organisation roles that have people associated 
    with them in alphabetical ascending order of person's last name. [liuba]
  * Fixed a bug in Manifestation/Resource Advanced search where a combination
    of solr and sql searches for both entities (Manifestation/Resource) was
    not filtering properly when searching by applicable to one entity only
    fields (ex. manifestation format or resource format, etc). [liuba]
  * WR#41964 - Relationship updated_by Field Hard Coded - get rid of
    hard-coded login_id = 1 by passing editing user login parameter to 
    RelationshipHelper.add_frbr_relationship(). Note: for some scripts
    that were previously used to create testing data, hard-coded login_id=1
    is left. [liuba]
  * Added controller_restrictions for hard_association_controller.rb methods
    for 'CAN_EDIT_TAP' privilege.[liuba]
  * Centralised privileges logic for CRM that checks whether an editing user 
    does have permission to publish CRM, if not, sets status of person or 
    organisation entities to 'Pending' and reindexes entity solr indexes and
    entity role contactinfos in Role.crm_privileges_check(login, role). [liuba]
  * WR#51527 - SUPERWORK - new ones created without composer - added composers names
    to the superwork title created by default from the associated work name. [liuba]
  * Changed the search-as-you-type composers search when creating a Work to
    a delayed search - the search is started when a user stops typing in the search
    textbox. [liuba] 
  * WR#42414 - Remove duplicate work relationships of type 'Is evidence of' -
    added script delete_duplicated_relatiosnips.rb [liuba]
  * WR#51298 - commented out 'Releasers' frbr relationship from Manifestation show 
    page as this is a duplicated info of Publisher field on the screen. [liuba]
  * WR#51061 - DISTINCTION Instance - 'masked' by default - changed status default 
    to 'Pending'. [liuba]
  * WR#51710 -Added the relationships: 'Is funded by' to Manifestation -> Role and
    Resource -> Role; 'Describes' to Resource -> Resource. [liuba]
  * Added 'CAN_EDIT_SALES_HISTORY' privilege, assigned
    'CAN_EDIT_SALES_HISTORY' and 'CAN_EDIT_BORROWED_ITEM' to
    Administrator and TAP Administrator users; added appropriate
    controller_restrictions, etc. [liuba]
  * WR#51720 - EXPRESSION - not showing the partial expression note -
    added partial expression note to be shown on Expression show page
    and in Performance History, Events sections of Work show page.
    [liuba]
  * Perms changes to /data/sounz/app/download to allow 'sounzreports' user to
    upload content via MacFusion. [paul]

  * Facets now toggleable without Javascript. [gordon]
  * WR50259 - Pouru / Pouro fix [gordon]
  * WR51473 - Lowercase person search as searches in capital letters failed. [gordon]
  * WR51473 - can now do CRM searches for "Firstname Lastname", e.g. "Gareth Farr" [gordon]
  * WR#51440 - fixed dates typo. [liuba]
  * WR#51194 - Image Alignment for Resources in Search Results - right-aligned
    Resource image. [liuba]
  * WR#51111 - MANIFESTATION display - 'not available' is confusing - replaced
    'Not Available' with 'Sample', put size of the sample after 'Sample',
    replaced sample icons by those used in search results for consistency.
    [liuba]
  * WR#42543 - made the organisation name to be displayed in italic in the 
    person's role contactinfo record of the search results to facilitate 
    its spotting in the list. [liuba]
  * WR#51506 - Manifestation/Resource Advanced search - saved search not working -
    fixed a bug in Works Advanced, Contributors Advanced, Events Advanced, 
    Manifestation/Resource Advanced searches when only 'new' searches were
    processed and results for the repeated searches were taken from session, this
    provoked different error situations reported in the WR, etc. [liuba]
  * Added controller restriction for /advanced_finder/type_formats, for a privilege 
    CAN_VIEW_TAP. [liuba]
  * WR#51533 - TINY MCE - bullet points don't show - default style for the site content
    is not to show bullet points for unordered lists - added special style for the 
    content of CM pages to display bullets. [liuba]
  * Added replacement processing for image url in main content field of campaign 
    mailout as extra precaution to make sure that even when old templates 
    (mailout contents) are used, the images link correctly to the current host - 
    this fixes the problem of previous release when images urls (if main content 
    is reused) display old 'production.sounz.org.nz'. [liuba]
  * WR#50002 - enhancements to News Articles functionality: 'Home' page displays
    max 2 feature articles; added a restriction, so that there are only 2 'feature'
    articles (with 'Published' status only, 'Pending' aGordon Andersonrticles can have unlimited 
    number of 'feature' articles) of 'Story' type at any time - when new 'feature'
    article is added, the oldest 'feature' article is set to false; added check 
    that sets 'feature' parameter to false for archived article. [liuba]
  * WR#50272 - CRM and TAP - statuses - removed 'Approved' status from Sample
    statuses drop-down list. [liuba]
  * WR#51552 - Sales History - updating status breaks. [liuba]
  * WR#51597 - WORKS - Difficulty display on show page - hide 'Unknown' diffuculty
    [liuba]
  * WR#42479 - TAP - Advanced search testing - applied some stripping to work 
    title search parameter, similar to FinderHelper.strip(string) but leaving
    quotes in - this fix a bug, when a search with a dot in the title returns
    no results. [liuba]
  * WR#51596 - Fixed Manifestation show page to display only samples relating 
    to a particular manifestation. [liuba]
  * WR#51593 - LOGINS - edit should be save - renamed submit button to 'Save'
    [liuba]
  * WR#51608 - EVENTS - entering a new event - workflow - separated 'Venue'
    widget from the event form, made it appear once an event has been created 
    and consistent with other relationship widgets. [liuba]
  * WR#51609 - EXPRESSION - wiki text not showing on Performance history -
    added the method to convert wiki text to html. [liuba]
  * WR#51610 - WIKITEXT - Italic affecting search results. [liuba]
  * WR#51613 - UMBRELLA EVENT - added date field to related events listing on 
    Event show, sorted related events by date. [liuba]
  * WR#51204 - EVENT- general note and links. [liuba]
  * WR#51592 - Page numbers - navigation for searches - the current page in
    pagination is not displayed as a link anymore to make it clear for user
    his/her current position in the list. [liuba]
  * WR#51392 - CRM - search order of results - the following organisation 
    fields are searched now in CRM basic search as requested by SOUNZ: 
    organisation_name, organisation_abbrev, known_as and related organisations 
    organisation_name, organisation_abbrev. Also, added to person search
    known_as field.
    IMPORTANT: Person, Organisation models require solr indexes to be rebuild. 
    [liuba]

    'Privileges' link to Login edit page. [liuba]
  * WR#51687 - Resource show page break fix. [liuba]

sounz (1.11.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Implemented new config-zencart.sh script which sets up zencart with

  * WR#42479 - TAP Advanced Search - made the works advanced search
    more precise by removing wildcard characters and replacing 'OR'
    operator by 'AND'; special processing for Title (work) field allowing
    user to wrap the search terms into quotes to make the search by Title
    even more precise. [liuba]
  * WR#51380 - EMAIL NEWs - anchor required in Tiny MCE - added anchor.
    [liuba]
  * Some database schema tidy-ups as part of datamodel syncing [paul]
  * WR#50256 - CRM - layout of screens - fixed the layouts as requested
    [liuba]
  * WR#51236 - RESOURCE - display: added licensers to 'Publisher'
    section; fixed the bug where 'Featuring' section was not displayed
    on Resource show/view; added missing associations: describes, 
    documents, recorded by, released by, is related to . [liuba]
  * WR#42543 - CRM - advanced search Marketing Cats and Roles - 
    implemented the logic requested when if a person has a role in the
    organisation, the person receives marketing categorisation of the
    general role of the organisation (the list of categories is displayed
    in Marketing Categorisation section of person's role, for info only,
    without editing controls). [liuba]
  * WR#50356 - added tooltip - 'Please login to buy' to Buy button of
    Manifestations and Resources. [liuba]
  * WR#51335 - PERFOMANCE Histories - date ordering - fixed the order
    of past performances: premiere is the first in the listing followed
    by other performances starting with the oldest and with the most 
    recent at the bottom of the list. [liuba]
  * WR#51350 - EVENT- not all venues showing in searches - on updating
    contributor details, the appropriate Role (the entity searched in) 
    solr indexes were not updated. Added the command to update Role's
    indexes. [liuba]    
  * WR#51339 - fixed a bug where newly created events were assigned
    the login id equal to 1 (currently, username 'gordon') instead of
    the login id of the editing user. [liuba]

    when for facets searches. [liuba]

  * WR51261 - CRM search now delays search until typing done [gordon]

  * Events now ordered so that opportunities use deadline, and if the
    field is blank index them under the year 2037 [gordon]
  * People contributors now order on last name [gordon]
  * People contributors now show correctly under letter facets (wrong
    index of array meant using first instead of last name) [gordon]

sounz (1.9.0) stable; urgency=low

  * WR51172 - Added manifestation titles to what is searched for Work
  * WR51172 - Add available for purchase, loan, hire facets to Music
    search [gordon]
  * WR50920 - Composers cannot be deleted in the association widget
    [gordon]
  * WR50712 - fixed order of works and contributors to respect numbers
    and case insensitivity [gordon]
  * Changed indexing script so that publicly visible SOLR searches are
    fixed first [gordon]
  * WR50259 - mainly spelling fixes [gordon]
  * Added privilege parameter to show_edit_links_if_permission(object, 
    privilege='CAN_EDIT_TAP')and show_tap_edit_link_for(object, 
    privilege='CAN_EDIT_TAP', text='Edit', ignore_class=false), default 
    to 'CAN_EDIT_TAP', to accommodate the special privileges for Events, 
    Distinctions, Contributors and Roles. [liuba] 
  * Small change to icon_for - to show object icons for user with 
    'CAN_VIEW_TAP' privilege instead of 'CAN_EDIT_TAP'. [liuba]
  * WR#51145 - changed duration display to be consistent with duration 
    display in search results- 20' or 3'54" rather than 00:20:00 or 
    00:03:54. [liuba]
  * WR#51202 - Select a Region in Events Advanced Search Breaks - fixed.
    [liuba]
  * WR#51203 - added blank option '--All Statuses--' which is displayed
    as a default instead of 'Approved'. [liuba]
  * WR#50540 - CRM contact lists sorting - fix for names starting with
    lower case and for upper case abbreviations - all names get 
    transformed to lower case for sorting to work smoothly.[liuba] 
  * WR#51091 - FRONT PAGE - contributor rotation - made the contributors
    selection random and distinct. [liuba]
  * Added width parameter to the News Articles listing in table format,
    so that article images are displayed strictly right-aligned, without
    depending on the size of article contents. [liuba]
  * WR#50871 - RESOURCE - search display - added anchor to Resource show
    page, so that 'Availability' links to its section with Buy/Borrow 
    buttons. [liuba]
  * WR#51123 - changed people/organisations statuses from 'Published' to 
    'Pending' (there should be no 'Published' status in CRM entities)
    IMPORTANT: RoleContactinfo model require solr indexes to be rebuild. 
    [liuba]
  * WR#51123 - Added person/organisation/contributor status icons to all 
    the CRM listings (search results, selected lists, saved contact lists)
    (except mailout lists) as discussed with Stephen Gibbs, SOUNZ. [liuba]
  * WR#51237 - FACETS - 'available as' samples not all showing
    WR#51092 - SAMPLES - searching for them has odd results 
    The "bug" in those WRs has been provoked by the recent changes in 
    the database schema when an appropriate Expression can be added 
    to the Sample to allow a way for Samples that are attached to a 
    Manifestation of, for example, 'CD' format but which are for a 
    single Expression (track) off that CD to be catalogued and displayed.
    So, now we have the Samples that can be associated to Works through 
    their Manifestations and those that can be associated through Work 
    Expressions (before Samples were associated to Works only through 
    their Manifestations). The following logic/implementation does solve
    the bug: to get to Work Samples, we do check each of Work Expression
    Manifestations Samples, if a sample expression id is the same as that 
    expression id or if a sample expression id is empty, then this is a
    Work Sample. 
    IMPORTANT: Work model require solr indexes to be rebuild. [liuba]

sounz (1.8.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Altered healthcheck so that it returns OK when servers are stopped
    eg. for upgrade or maintenance [paul]
  * Add build-depends on 'debra' package. If you need to build the system
    then first get this package and install it [paul]
  * WR#51182 - added cronjob to delete sessions older than 7 days from
    SOUNZ_HOME/sounz/tmp/sessions. This will run every morning.
  * WR#51123 - added links to listing page to go directly to relevant person
    or organisation.
  * WR#51039 - Remove google analytics for editors
  * WR#51143 - Now show 10 results (as before) but paginate correctly
  * WR#51094 - Fix multiple-sample score manifestations
  * WR#51123 - changed search results in CRM to show status and login
  * WR#51095 - login edit now shows correct member types, not those of the
    person who is editing
  * WR#51091 - now shows more performers, as previously only those contributors
    with ICON images were showing.
  * WR#51083 - Display composer names correctly spaced out with line breaks
  * WR#50908 - deleted lots of things that start with Delete
  * WR#41819 - reindex of Superwork fixed superwork search problem
  * WR#51508 - adding the missing four regions to Canada
  * Updated hosts.allow with new SOUNZ static IP 202.154.159.26
  * WR#50894 - Added code in postinst to move the default (/usr/share/sounz)
    application location to specific one (/app/sounz) if the new partition
    is present on the server.
  * WR#50540 - Added sorting of contacts - by last name of contact (person)
    (although the people names are displayed starting with first_names fields
    as requested by SOUNZ in WR#42585) ascending order, then by first names
    of contact (person) ascending order, then by organisation name of contact
    or by organisation abbreviation of contact ascending order - in CRM
    search results, CRM saved contact lists and campaign mailouts. 
    IMPORTANT: Organisation and RoleContactinfo models require solr indexes 
    to be rebuild. [liuba]
  * Added login parameter to person.create_self, organisation.create_self,
    role.create_self methods to implement the privileges logic for SOUNZ 
    administrators in CRM. Note some of the processing of solr updating
    of roles and contact infos is currently commented out - it puts such
    a load on solr (due to the updates of different related objects in CRM
    and TAP) that it breaks from time to time on my machine. [liuba]
  * WR#50519: if solr search was returning 0 results (ex. no work existed 
    with the particular work category assigned to it), all sql query results 
    were added as 'filteredResults', which is wrong in the case where there 
    were search terms for solr search - added the processing for that case
    [liuba]
  * WR#50908 - changed the logic for displaying not-'Published' objects on 
    the public part of the site - previously they were displayed but without
    links to their details, now we hide them completely from the public part
    of the website, so that if an object is flagged as 'Masked'/'Withdrawn'/
    'Pending', it is not shown to a user without 'CAN_VIEW_TAP' permission.
    [liuba]
  * WR#42479 - TAP - Advanced search testing - fixed bugs. [liuba]
  * WR#51084 - SELECTED RESULTS - added controller_restrictions for users
    who have privilege 'CAN_SAVE_SEARCH'. [liuba]
  * WR#51072 - News Articles - Enhancements. [liuba]
  * WR#51059 - RELATIONSHIPS - duplicates appearing in search results - bug
    has been provoked by the use of two queries - one for roles with people
    associated with them and another for roles with organisations associated
    with them, in some cases they were returning the same results - addition
    of unique filter fixed the problem. [liuba]
  * WR#51097 - NEWS and EVENTS - ordering by date - sorted 'Archived' news
    by date in descending order; sorted Events Search Results by date/time
    in ascending order and then by city in ascending order. 
    IMPORTANT: Event model requires solr indexes to be rebuild. [liuba]
  * Fixed the Events Advanced Search, so that in case when there are only
    solr search parameters given, it does not do sql filtering. [liuba]
  * WR#51122 - changed the name of the 'Requested SOUNZ Newsletter' saved 
    contact list to 'Requested Email Updates'. [liuba]
  * WR#50417 - SONLINE - Event search and display pages audit - deleted
    separate 'Contact Details' section, made 'Venue and Booking Details'
    section (including 'booking note') to be displayed even if there is
    no venue assigned to an event. [liuba]
  * WR#51145 - WORK DISPLAY - duration missing - added 'Duration' field,
    hide 'Programme Note' if not available. [liuba]

  * Page links on show in FRBR lists if required (more than 20 results)

sounz (1.0.1) stable; urgency=low

  * Refined the debian package postinsts so that they use the 'tell()' script
    function to emit (echo) messages, and 'getans()' to read input. This
    should suppress messages when there is no /dev/tty terminal available
    eg. for remote package installs. [paul]
  * The database upgrade patch applier now dumps the database before applying
    any patches. An example 'do nothing' patch has been included with
    this upgrade to test this. [paul]
  * The Apache configuration file generator (config-apache.sh) now asks if
    existing conf file should be re-created. Usually it shouldn't be, unless
    some changes have been made. [paul]
  * Removed sounz-doc package. Wastes time building this every time. Will
    just leave it as legacy in SVN repo. [paul]
  * Introduced /etc/sounz/sounz.changes file which contains the changes from
    the latest version in the changelog. [paul]
  * Provided a new 'make' target. A 'make deploy' is now possible which
    enables make deployment direct to the target server(s) including
    debian package installation.
