DATABASE PATCHES
================

1. Naming
==========
Files in this directory must adhere to a strict naming format if they are
to be automatically picked up by the postinst patch-applier when you install
the new debian package. The format is:

    upgrade_P.Q.R_to_X.Y.Z.sql

where:
    P.Q.R is the version of the currently installed package 
    X.Y.Z is the new package version this patch will upgrade the schema to

The patch applier will apply mutiple patches to span more than one version
in the sequence, if required, though usually this won't occur in the normal
course of applying upgrades.

In general, you will not be supplying a database patch for each version
upgrade of the SOUNZ packages. That's just fine. You just create a
database patch for those upgrades which do need one, and the patcher will
use it on that upgrade.

Eg. if the last patch file was for upgrading SOUNZ from 2.3.0 --> 2.3.1,
but there was no patch for 2.3.1 --> 2.3.2, or 2.3.2 --> 2.3.3, and then
for the next upgrade of 2.3.3 --> 2.3.4, there IS a patch file, you would just
name your patch file as: 'upgrade_2.3.3_to_2.3.4.sql' and the patcher
will do the right thing.

In other words, just include patch files for the upgrades which need 'em!


2. Patch SQL
=============
Please adhere to the standards set by the 'sounz-online-schema-postgres.sql'
SOUNZ database definition script (in directory above this one).

If you add foreign key fields, make sure you define the FK constraints as
per the above file, with deferred triggers, and informative constraint
names.

Make sure you include any data statements you need to go with your patch.
For example, if you are adding a new field which has a NOT NULL constraint,
be sure to add the field, then do a data update of all existing records
to set it's value to a default, then apply the NOT NULL constraint.

Be sure to bracket your upgrade SQL statements with a BEGIN; ... COMMIT;
so that erroneous patches will be rolled back.

Make sure you test your upgrade patch on a latest database dump of the
SOUNZ database before applying the upgrade.

If things went wrong during the debian package upgrade, and the patches
didn't get applied, you should consult the log (see below), find out why
and fix the SQL. Then just apply the patch again. It will be found in
the SOUNZ_HOME/db/patches directory.


3. Upgrade log
===============
The database patcher will append output to a logfile every time it is
run which might contain useful information if things didn't go as planned.
The path to this logfile is also printed out for you each time, but
is usually found in /var/log/sounz/upgrade-db.log


4. Database dump
=================
The database patcher will dump the SOUNZ database prior to doing an
upgrade patch. The path to this dump is printed out at the time, but is
usually to be found as a timstamped .dump file in the directory
/data/sounz/app/backup/

NB: These dumps do not have to be cleared away as there is a housekeeping
cronjob which takes care of that.
