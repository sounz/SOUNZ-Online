  internal_note: "Programme Note: This bicultural music drama for choir, kapa haka, orchestra, soloists, narrator, also Maori and Irish traditional instruments was a collaboration among Helen Fisher (music), Wi Kuki Kaa (Maori composition) and Lauris Edmond (lyrics). The production that took place at the Nelson School of Music in May 1998, involving one hundred performers, drew on John and Hilary Mitchell�s extensive manuscript �Te Tau Ihu o Te Waka - A History of Maori of Nelson and Marlborough�. �Taku Wana� focuses on stories, both positive and painful, of our joint Maori- Pakeha history in Nelson since 1841 particularly the events surrounding the Wairau tragedy in 1843.  Rangimoana Taylor was the artistic director and Rita Paczian was the conductor.Creative New Zealand Toi Aotearoa, as well as local sponsors and producers, gave significant support. In the title, the Maori word �wana� has several shades of meaning, including �dignity�, ray of sunlight� and �new bud�. �Taku Wana - the Enduring Spirit� holds onto the ideal of the inner dignity of each person living in Aotearoa New Zealand, where Maori are fully acknowledged as Tangata Whenua and where Tangata Tiriti, that is, all other cultures stand tall as well.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The drama and poetry of traditional Scots ballads have a universal appeal, but particularly for a com poser who (like many New Zealanders) has Scots ancestry. King Orfeo is unusual in that it is based on the Greek legend of Orpheus, who now plays the bagpipes rather than the lute; and doubly usual in that it has a happy ending with Orfeo rescuing his Isabel. The other two ballads are more typical in their themes of darkness and death. Lord Randal's story is told in dialogue with his mother; it is interesting that another dialogue-ballad, Edward, was set by Schubert towards the end of his life.

All three movements of the work reflect the curious juxtaposition of the hectic and the serene which is Hong Kong, the beautiful and the harsh, the breathtaking quiet and the deafening roar of a huge commercial hub. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the Temple at Wong Tai Sin, the intensely religious surrounded by the towering effigies of capitalism.  Of course, this was over a decade ago and since writing the work, China has taken the colony over from the British.  I doubt if the character expressed in this work has changed much, if at all - the residents of Hong Kong will always be enigmatic and beyond categorization! Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'blessed unrest', was one of six short pieces commissioned by the New Zealand Trio as \"attention-grabbing\", programme opening pieces. They wanted something that would start a concert \"with all guns blazing\"; a piece that ought to be \"high-impact, dynamic and edgy\". It took a long time until I found something that I thought satisfied this demand, as I didn't want to write an obviously motoric pulse-based piece. I wanted to create a sense of pent-up energy and its release in bursts. Many approaches were tried and rejected and while this was going on I came across the quote that gave the piece its title. I don't think my dissatisfaction with earlier versions of the piece was either 'queer' or 'divine' and I dislike the lofty tone, but parts of Martha Graham's statement nevertheless resonated with me: \"There is vitality, a life force, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all time, this expression is unique. If you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and be lost. The world will not have it. It is not yours to determine how good it is; nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep the channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work. You have to keep open and aware directly to the urges that motivate you. Keep the channel open. No artist is ever pleased. There is no satisfaction whatever at any time. There is only a queer divine dissatisfaction; a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more alive than the others.\" Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

I envisaged the bundle in this case as a bundle of notes from which the performer(s) can freely bring their own sensitivities, experiences and responses to the work�s realisation.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: My original thought was to call this cycle of pieces for choir �Odd Characters�, for each piece describes the actions of someone just that little bit �different� from the ordinary. Once again I�ve turned to the poetry of American Jack Prelutsky. His children�s poetry is widely published and anthologised, and ideal for choral music suited to school age choirs. The first piece is about a home handyman father who just won�t stop trying to fix things. The title, �I Wish My Father Wouldn�t Try to Fix Things Anymore� sums it up nicely. Needless to say his efforts meet with limited success. The second piece is about someone who loves bugs � in fact calling them his or her �close companions�. The third piece is a song about Frenetica Fluntz who always has to do several things at the once � a true multi-tasker! The final song, �Dixxer�s Excellent Elixir�, is about Dexter Dixxer and his strange elixir that has a range of odd and unexpected effects on him. However he�s quite happy to share it with his brother! Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Melodic ideas and motifs are derived from a magic square by Renaissance artists Albrecht Durer, which appear son the woodcut called 'Melancholia'.   The first movement is energetic in character, while the second is sad and melancholic, with a slowly rocking idea being suggestive of  a lullaby. The third movement is obsessive in rhythm, with a gentler contrasting middle section.  After a reflective opening, the finale burst into a rustic, dance-like mood.  Towards the end, various motifs from earlier movements are integrated into the texture and the work ends with a flourish.   This is a substantial, yet approachable work for professional musicians.   1. Allegro  2. Like a lullaby  3. allegro pesante  4. misterioso - allegro molto    Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: For the composer, 'Fantasia' is a particularly significant work.  It was her first ever commission. Numerous performances in Europe by Tessa Birnie � including a premiere broadcast on Radio Turkey! � led to subsequent performances by other pianists. Displaying a new technical confidence from her studies with Peter Maxwell Davies, the work�s single unified structure marks a turning point in Whitehead�s composing method. The title, refers not so much to free fantasy but to the imagination required to create music from minimal material; in this case - the opening three-note motive.  The work is in three sections, corresponding to these notes, and fabric of the entire piece is generated from them.  There are patterns that emerge within sections, as well as those spanning the entire piece, (trills and tempi changes included).  Because of the inherent symmetry of the generated material, with layers building up both forwards and backwards, Whitehead�s original intention was to make a palindromic structure, but it became instead a through-composed work with coda.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: �Leise Rieselt der Schnee� uses as a starting point the Austrian carol of that name.  The piece is a kind of homage to Austrian folk music, which is so pure in its simplest forms, and which has had such a wide influence through the music of classical composers.  I have also used other music which is still sung in the alps, as well as some �jodlers� of my own: the plainchant, �Christ ist erstanden�, �Innsbruck, ich muss dich lassen�, by Isaac, �Verlassen bin i�, in Alpine dialect, and the �Andachtsjodler�, which is traditionally sung at Christmas.  I also used a few bars of Mozart�s clarinet quintet, which is very like the �Andachtsjodler�, because the spirit of Alpine folk music is very much alive in his music. �Leise Rieselt der Schnee� was written for the Sydney University Musical Society.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work is based on material from the opera 'At the Hawk's Well', specifically, the tonal thematic material associated with the Young Man which also appears later in the Dance Music. Constructed in an arch-form, both the violin and the cello share a dialogue based on a strong lyrical melody. On the idea of variation, is not so much employed in the classical sense as the principal melody stays constant, the variation occurs in the accompanying texture throughout the piece. In the outer sections the melody is presented in a somewhat exuberant manner by the violin in contrast to the cello where it is more subdued.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Unable to find a suitable poem about mothers I decided that grandmothers might be a suitable substitute. I turned to the poetry of Jack Prelutsky whose work I have often set over the past five or six years, and found �Hurry, Grandma Hurry�. This became the beginning of a cycle about relatives: in turn grandmother, grandfather, mother and father. �Hurry, Grandma Hurry� presents us with the typical activities of a young boy or girl while being looked after by a hassled grandmother. The child swings from trees, roller-skates (backwards), threatens to eat a bug and so on. Poor Grandma has trouble keeping up with the pace. �Grandpa McWheeze� is a rather eccentric fellow who does all sorts of unusual things: standing on his head while buttering his bread, playing bassoons made from prunes and tying springs to his knees. There can be few like him! �Oh Mother, I am Blue Today� is a short poem which plays on the word blue and its various meanings. Appropriately the music suggests a blues style. The implications of the title of the final piece, �When Daddy Sat on the Tomatoes� are obvious � he wasn�t very pleased at all! The big question is, will somebody own up?

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The text for this work draws on ideas and images from a number of sources, ranging from contemporary poetry to the psalms of the bible.  It is a son of celebration of the Earth and all its abundance.  The initial form of the text was devised by Deirdre McOnie. The work is a joyous song of praise.  More reflective music alternates with rhythmic writing.  Throughout, the music makes much use of syncopation. \"Celebrate the Earth\" was originally written for an overseas competition whose theme was \"A Celebration of Earth Day\".  This revised and orchestrated version was written on a commission from Auckland Choral Society for their 2000 concert season.  It was one of five choral fanfares commissioned for their subscription series.  The concert for which this fanfare was written was to be a Bach 250th anniversary concert.  the scoring is for Baroque orchestra including harpsichord and organ.  Given the nature of the concert I couldn't resist including a short reference to the BACH musical motive (B-flat - A - C - B natural in pitch terms).  It appears in the brief organ solo towards the end of the work. \"Celebrate the Earth!\" is dedicated to the Auckland Choral Society and their conductor Peter Watts.  Its commissioning was made possible by a grant from the Lottery Grants Board.  The first performance took place on 24 March 2000 at Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland. This subsequent version for expanded orchestral forces, including jazz band instruments, was made for Youth arts 2000, a celebration of artistic performances by young people held in Wellington in August 2000.  It was intended as a massed item at the end of the final concert, hence the inclusion of jazz bands in the scoring as well as a large orchestra. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Structure modelled on Bartok's 6th String Quartet, with 3 quick movements, each proceeded by a slow introduction - the 3 treatments of the introduction become fuller each time. Also Bartokian rhythmic influence: 5/8, 11/8, 7/4 movements and sections. I think (?) it had a student performance at Cambridge; I also entered it for the Soviets for the Performance of New Music (SPNM) who accepted it, but by then I was a student with Ben Fankel's class at the Guildhall in London, and he advised me to withdraw it - on the grounds (as I remember) that I could do better! Perhaps I could, but looking back at it, I feel it has a youthful freshness, so I've put it into the SOUNZ library as being available for performance. No takers yet. I've also made arrangements of the Trio section of the 2nd movement as a separate piece, called Musette. The solo guitar version is published in Sue Court's Guitar Aotearoa, and there is a piano version in a set of 8 pieces called  Off-beat (1992 - unpublished), which shows that I still like this bit of the Serenade, at least!

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work was written in a few days while the composer was attending the 1987 National Summer School in Choral Conducting at Nelson. It was tailored to the needs of the particular tutor group, and needed to be quickly rehearsed - hence the relatively easy SAB choral parts in the original voicing. The first performance was conducted by the composer in one of the school's twilight concerts. A subsequent version for SSA was made a week or so later and used at another summer school by the composer.  The work is a setting of a short poem by American poet Emily Dickinson (1831-1886), and is dedicated the Australian conductor and music educator Faye Dumont. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: My first experiences of the soundworlds of Mahler's late orchestral works revealed to me the vast distances over which late romantic harmonic language can transport the listener. I was instantly taken by the immense power generated by Mahler's continual re-casting of the opening melodies of the Ninth (last mvt) and Tenth (first mvt) Symphonies, in subtlely or radically new harmonic and orchestrational contexts. One waits in expectation of the return of the opening and, no matter whether it's the first or the fiftieth hearing, is stunned by the genius of the new twist applied. 'Aufsatz' (German for \"essay\") is my attempt at capturing - in some very small way - the gist of Mahler's regenerative methods. The piece is a lopsided sonata form, where an angular development is followed by a vastly expanded recapitulation, which culminates in a perpetual re-spinning of the opening material, cut short by a brief and optimistic coda. 'Aufsatz' is dedicated to my piano teacher from an early age, Margaret Carryer. Read by the NZSO in November 2003, with a further �broadcast standard� reading in 2006.  Hamish McKeich conducted on both occasions. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The opening piece of an orchestral concert has traditionally been the ubiquitous \"overture\"; whether it be a concert piece of short duration, or a real overture belonging to a stage work.  A \"fanfare\", however, conjures up visions of red-coated trumpeters standing majestically in a row and playing as loudly as possible!  An orchestral fanfare to open a concert is an unusual animal, somewhat akin to the \"concerto for orchestra\", and can happily be left open to interpretation by the lucky composer who gets to write one. Fanfare for a City begins with a brief opening brass chorale hinting at things to come, a fanfare with a sense of excitement and jubilation culminating in a return to the opening chorale written in Bach style that would never have been written by Bach.  Fanfare for a City was commissioned by Symphony Australia for the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra's 2001 subscription series. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

While these works are complete and interesting in their own right, they also function as commentaries and footnotes on each other, and on the cluster of preoccupations they share, as much as on the paintings for which they are nominally studies. Composers do this sort of thing less often, but it was with this idea of a study in mind that I set out to write a small \"clarinet concerto\" for Gretchen Dunsmore and 175 East. While 'a study for voicing doubts' is a complete composition in its own right it's also a testing ground for ideas which may well be developed and extended when I get around to writing a larger-scale piece for clarinet and ensemble. This will of course be called 'Not a study for voicing doubts'.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Historical background  I got to know Euan Murdoch both as a friend and as a musician when he came to Dunedin to teach cello at the University some years ago.  Everything about Euan encouraged me to write him a piece: his lively and warm personality, his huge enthusiasm for music and his brilliance as a player, plus a certain down-to-earth Kiwi quality that is refreshing to encounter within classical music circles.  Having composed 'The Blue Sonata' for him in 1999, I was approached by Euan to write something else.  He had moved to Wellington for a job at Victoria University, and wanted a piece for Trio Victoria.  I relished this opportunity to compose again for Euan, and for the others in the group, Doug Beilman and Thomas Hecht.   During 2000 I came to the conclusion I needed a substantial break from composing, due to what might be termed creative 'burn out'.  I also wanted the time to reassess the direction I was heading with my music.  Consequently, the trio commission arrived at a time where I felt the urge to experiment and come up with something a little different.  Having said that, there are connecting threads with earlier pieces, particularly my Symphony No.2 which was premiered at the Wellington Arts Festival in 2000.   Piano Trio was commissioned by Chamber Music New Zealand, with funding provided by Creative New Zealand.   The Music  This Piano Trio attempts to suggest psychological states through sound images.  It is not directly programmatic but, as the titles of the movements suggest, there are distinct ideas and moods imbedded in the music.  The first movement uses imaginary characters from childhood - 'Maggie Boy' and 'Nice Boy' - as representations of two sides of personality: the bad and the good, or the dark and the light.  'Maggie Boy' has music that is barbarous, angular and dissonant.  In the opening section a 12-note theme appears, providing the basis for much of the material that follows.   Following a metric modulation (or change in note values) the violin and cello play a wispy, lyrical theme that portrays 'Nice Boy', while the pianist's right hand tinkers away with 12-note themes, impervious to the sentiments of the strings.  'Maggie Boy' returns in the final section of the movement, dispatching 'Nice Boy' to the recesses of the mind.   The second movement, 'The Deamon', is concerned with neither good nor bad but rather the nothingness of depression, that caged state of mind where emotions and feelings seem to spiral inwards.  Melodic lines twist and turn, trying to find a way out of the psychological cage.  Reference is made to the 12-note theme from the first movement, as well as the 'life and death' theme from my Symphony No.2.   The third movement, 'Hyper-dyper' is, as its title suggests, ebullient and almost frantically busy. An angular and jazzy opening theme is followed by a nervous, darting second theme featuring some special effects on the strings. The piano rudely interrupts proceedings and a playful but tense middle section follows, based on the 12-note theme from the first movement. In the Coda the 'hyper' quality dominates and the Trio comes to an end on a crunching discord.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

It opens with an expression of te taha wairua of two Aotearoa cultures (Karanga and Gregorian Chant \"Veni Sancte Spiritus\"), then a journey away from te taha wairua and te taha aroha towards greed and materialism (Corporate Beat, Haka). This leads to experiences of pain, confusion and abuse (I Crave That Place, Waiata Tangi ), out of which come insights, hope and a sense of self-worth ( Kia Hoatu He Tumanaako, Karakia ki te Wairua Tapu), to embrace energetically and enthusiastically the questions and challenges of the new millenium : about individuals-in-community, and social and cultural values based on  te aroha and te taha wairua (Nga Porowhita Aroha).  \"Tete Kura\" is a bicultural, collaborative composition for choir, kapa haka, kai-karanga and solo soprano and tenor. The music was composed by Helen Fisher, Ngapo and Pimia Wehi and Taru mai-i-tawhiti Kerehoma. The lyrics were written by Ngapo and Pimia Wehi, John Greally, Oriini Kaipara, Helen Fisher, as well as including some biblical extracts. \"Tete Kura\" was performed by Te Waka Huia and the New Zealand Youth Choir for the Wellington Youth Arts 2000 Festival,  being funded by a project grant from Creative New Zealand Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa.

The stanza which begins �They shall grow not old�� is widely known and almost universally used at ANZAC Day commemorations. What is less well-known is that it is merely the 4th stanza of seven. For this setting I choose to include the 6 lines which immediately precede the 4th stanza. These make references to music (�There is music in the midst of desolation...�), and also to the sacrifice of those who fought and died. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This group of songs for young performers returns to a topic close to most people�s hearts: food! Following on from the sets �Just Desserts� and �Garbage Delight� these five songs present a humorous and at times silly look at the subject. The first song sings the praises of rat as a lunchtime dish, and is one of two settings of the American poet Jack Prelutsky in this set. His poetry has been a regular source for my vocal settings for several years, and his work always abounds in humour and a slightly skewed view of life. The second song warns of the potential dangers of dining with a pig and its unpredictable table manners. The third song, the briefest of the set, gives another take on the story of Mary who �had a little lamb�. The fourth song (the other Prelutsky text) tells of the joys of making fudge, and the potential for making a mess at the same time. The final song is about pie-making, but including some rather unorthodox ingredients. These songs are designed for young singers and use texts specifically written with young people in mind. The piano accompaniments are relatively simple. The pieces can be performed by solo voices or chorally in unison. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The 'Love Sonnets of Michelangelo' I wrote for Michael Parmenter with whom I worked on a programme entitled �Between Two Fires�. (Also included was a dance-theatre work I created collaboratively with Michael, using his voice as well as his body, with imagery extracted from the diaries of Franz Kafka.) At the time I was focused on different styles of melody, having just completed my Five Melodies for Piano. Inspired by the lovely voices of some of the then current students in our School of Music, I felt that women�s voices gave the expressive quality I wanted, as well as providing a useful �cover� for the overtly homoerotic tenor of the texts. The original production used film, shot by my good friend Bayley Watson, showed the dancer�s prostrate figure, swathed in bandages. As the performance unfolded the cloth was gradually cut and pealed back by hands belonging to an old man whose face we never saw, the intended metaphor being of the sculptor cutting away marble to reveal the male form that he sensed already existed within the stone. The work has since had other performances that have discarded the theatrical elements, most successfully when each setting is prefaced by a reading of the poem in translation. One of the greatest artists of all time, Michelangelo was also an important poet. These settings of some of his most personal sonnets articulate the anguish of love and desire, as well as the despair of old age. The musical style combines the theatricality of Italian bel canto with the direct expressivity of folksong. Love Sonnets of Michelangelo was originally sung by Leslie Graham and Linden Loader and danced by Michael Parmenter. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This set of songs continues my series of �themed� sets of songs suitable for younger singer (or those who may be in their first few years of lessons). The vocal ranges are not extreme, and the melodic lines relatively simple. The accompaniments do not require virtuoso pianists, and the pieces are intended to be immediately appealing to an audience. As the title suggests the pieces here are all about animals � furry friends! The first piece, to a text by John Ciardi, is about one of the most popular of domestic animals � the dog. Here the song tells of a dog bought for a dollar � not a pedigree dog but a bargain buy � lots of dogs all rolled up into one. The second song takes the idea of �furry friends� a little further afield � to the Australian kangaroo. The poem by Elizabeth Coatsworth describes the movement of the kangaroo across the Australian plains, with a suitably �bounding� accompani-ment from the piano. The same poet provides the text of the third song: �The Mouse�. The mouse laments that it is no longer easy to find a few crumbs on the floor of the kitchen � everything is now in jars, or in tins, or up high on the pantry shelf. The floor is bare, suitable only for dancing in the moonlight. The fourth song brings us to that other popular domestic pet � the cat. Here, Eve Merriam�s stray cat is described as being �just an old alley cat� but still beautiful in the eyes of those who find it. The final song is �The Monkey� and sets a tongue-twister of a poem by Robert S. Oliver. The poet plays with rhymes of �-erous� while describing a mischievous monkey where mutual dislike seems to reign. The texts are all drawn from the �Collins Treasury of Animal Poems� edited by well-known American poet Jack Prelutsky (whose own poetry I have set on many occasions).

It is based on an imaginary scene from years ago when a railway branch line went through native bush in the Catlins area of NZ.   The motif at the start is a bird-call the composer heard in the area.

The middle piece is an arrangement of the well known Japanese folk song Sakura Sakura, while the outer pieces feature variations of melodic phrases heard at different registers.  The original set of five pieces was performed by Ross Carey at Victoria University of Wellington in March 1996. The revised set of pieces was first performed by Yuji Takahashi in his  concert of 20th Century piano music in the series \"100 Pianists of the Century\" in Omiya, Saitama in February 1999.  This performance was later released on the CD piano, volume 9 of Yuji�s \"Real Time\" series, on the FONTEC label (FOCD 3452).  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Although there is only one continuous movement, it is divided into three sections with the aforementioned contrasting variations. \"A\" is a transcription of a prison work song 'I had five long years' recorded at the notorious Angola State Penitentiary in Louisiana in 1959 by Harry Oster (released on Folk-Lyric Recording Co., Louisiana Folklore Society).  The original singer was James Russell and some other inmates.  To appreciate the anguish and bitterness behind these prison songs, one must become familiar with the outrageous conditions to which inmates were subjected during its worst years.  \"B\" is a transcription of the railroad song, 'John Henry' as sung by Rich Amerson, a transient from Alabama as recorded by Harold Courlander in 1956 for Folkways Records.  \"I ain't proud to be poor, but I ain't too poor to be proud,\" he was recorded as saying.  Its treatment is also indicative of early jug band recordings of the 1920s which I enjoy.  \"C\" is a transcription of the 'Bayou Teche Waltz' as played by Columbus Fruge, a Cajun accordion player and singer recorded in the 1920s. As stated previously, each transcription is dealt with in a set of two variations.  Variation 1 is a polytonal variation to be played exactly as written.  Variation 2 is an optional improvised section which can either be played exactly as notated or partially as notated and/or completely improvised thereupon.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This setting of Psalm 145, verses 1 to 3, was written in 1969 for a disc Scriptures of Worship, released by Scripture in Song.  It has been revised several times, the latest being in 1991, when the organ accompaniment was added. The piano accompaniment may be used to support congregational singing, or to accompany a choir singing the two parts.  It may even be used with the organ accompaniment.  (The style of the organ part is such as to contrast with rather than follow the piano part.)  The organ accompaniment does not carry the air, and should not be used on its own to carry congregational singing. The parts have been written with a small range, so as to suit most voices.  There are a couple of divisi sections in which one of the lines may be omitted according to the capabilities of the choir.  As a result, the arrangement should be accessible to just about any group of singers. The text is as follows: I will extol thee, my God and King, and bless Thy Name for ever. Every day I will bless thee and praise Thy Name, and bless Thy Name for ever. Great is the Lord, and his greatness unsearchable. I will extol Thee, my God and King, and bless Thy Name for ever.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Stellar Meditations' is a series of musical meditations on \"Ave Maris Stella\" (Hail O Star of the Ocean) a popular liturgical chant of unknown origin. It can be dated back to at least the 9th century for it is preserved in the Codex Sangallensis, a 9th century manuscript now in the Swiss Monastery of St. Gallen. Two sound images permeate the piece. One is an ocean image of gentle wave surges and is heard in the introduction. The other is a bell sound which appears in the mallet percussion instruments with resonances in the harmony of muted cornets and trombones. This harmony consists of perfect intervals; fourths and fifths which are subsequently spiced by bell-like tone qualities which create colourful brass sounds. Structurally, 'Stellar Meditations' consists of an introduction and three chorales separated by two interludes and followed by a coda. The chorales feature the full brass while the interludes and coda are delicately scored in a contrapuntal texture.   Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Although these seventeen minutes are essential for the deployment of the piece, more important to this composer is the impression that remains in the mind of the listener after the final sound has died away.  I hope that some sense of shape or form is conveyed and that, rather than just a few salient features, the listener will apprehend a complete \"object\" which can later be reviewed and explored within his or her mind.  It is this relationship between the temporal exposition of the piece and the spatial residue that the title, \"time's distance\", refers to. \"time's distance\" was commissioned by and is dedicated to CadeNZa.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: These three vocalises, using Maori vowel sounds, were first recorded by the Wellington members of the National Youth Choir. They were composed for the opening section of �Wahine Toa�, a dance theatre celebration of Maori female ancestral figures. This work was performed at Taki Rua Theatre in Wellington in 1992 and in Christchurch in 1993. The three pieces are: 1.   �Te Po Nui, Te Po Roa�, where male voices hum a series of sustained chords. 2.   �The Earth Lay in the Womb of Darkness� - inspired by Robin Kahukiwa�s painting of the same title. This choral vocalise by full choir begins with alto melodic line, soon building to a widely spaced texture of superimposed fifth chords. 3.  �Papatuanuku - the Separation of Ranginui and Papatuanuku�.  The vocalise begins gently, becoming increasingly contrapuntal, building to five strong chords, and ending with a �sighing� texture of vocal glissandi. �Wahine Toa� was choreographed by Keri Kaa, Jan Bolwell and Sunny Amey, and was commissioned with assistance from the Queen Elizabeth 11 Arts Council of New Zealand.

The genesis of the piece is the chord progression outlined by the piano in the first movement, accompanied by uneasy chromatic lines in the bass register; these elements are explored in various ways in subsequent movements.  There are optional parts for small bell (movement 3) and gongs (movement 5).  The lyrical qualities expressed in the work�s title come most to the fore in the sixth movement, a cantabile melody in the violin heard over descending sostenuto progressions in the piano.  In the third movement the left hand of the piano is taken from Stockhausen�s 1951 composition Spiel. Composed for the opening of the new School of Music Building, Victoria University of Wellington, in 1989, and performed on this occasion by Gavin Saunders (violin), Ross Carey (piano) and Gareth Farr (percussion).

Ben Hoadley gave the piece its first performance at the International Double Reed Convention in Melbourne in 2004.  'Nga ha o nehera' is a five-movement suite, written after  a taonga puoro wananga at Ohinemutu on the shores of Lake Rotorua.  The first movement is 'Nga ha o nehera', meaning a breath from the past, the second, 'puna wera', describes the continual welling up of hot water from a spring at the edge of the lake, and the third, 'Mokoia', suggests the soundscape of Mokoia Island, which, as well as a major historical site, is also a bird sanctuary.  The fourth movement He purakau, recounts a folk-story - not a specific tale, but suggesting the  elements of all strong stories, and the last movement, 'Ohinemutu', locates the piece in place, and suggests something of the story of Hinetekakara, the ancestress of the Te Arawa people, whose untimely death gave the place its name.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In the middle of 2002, Tim Cummings, an American who had been living in New Zealand for some years, returned home and, with his friend Ringo, embarked on a road-trip from Florida to Los Angeles. Along the way he e-mailed his friends a series of haiku poems (sixteen in total) that related his coast-to-coast experiences of a land that, although his own, he had come to feel like a stranger in. From the lethargy and obesity of Florida's residents, to the disturbing cruelty of an animal park tour guide in Louisiana, to the beautiful but oppressive landscape of the desert, the depraved glitz of Las Vegas and the polluted haze hanging above Los Angeles, Tim's haiku, though necessarily brief, said much about the country from which Western popular culture draws so much.  I began the task of setting Tim's words to music as momentum was gathering for the American-lead war on Iraq. Articles in the New Zealand Listener and the writings of John Pilger, and others, on America's place in the world, informed much of how I perceived my texts and coloured my composition.  'Don't Mess With Texas' is a view - admittedly through a distant lense - of an essentially insular people, whose outward gestures, driven by self-interest and an unconscious belief in the superiority of their culture, often take on menacing forms. The many style quotations should not be interpreted as hammy representations of American stereotypes portrayed with music, but rather should reflect the sometimes dangerous consequences of unbridled patriotism and of ignorance of matters global. That said, 'Dont' Mess With Texas' deals not only with America's human population and alluded to socio-political-environmental matters, but with the beauty of its natural interior, where a redemptive musical language is able to emerge from the urban chaos. 'Don't Mess With Texas' is dedicated to Tim Cummings, the sort of open-eyed American the world needs more of. 'Don�t Mess With Texas' was premiered by gateseven in May 2003, conductor Ewan Clark, soprano soloist Madeleine Pierard. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

It was tailored to the needs of the particular tutor group, and needed to be quickly rehearsed - hence the relatively easy SAB choral parts in the original voicing. The first performance was conducted by the composer in one of the school's twilight concerts. This version for SSA was made a week or so later and used at another summer school by the composer.  The work is a setting of a short poem by American poet Emily Dickinson (1831-1886), and is dedicated the Australian conductor and music educator Faye Dumont. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The texts are by poet Colin McNaughton whose poetry, especially that for children, is widely published. The first song is in the form of a postcard and tells of the conditions found on holiday � the state of the sea, the weather, the food, the hotel and so on. The second song presents, from the point of view of the child, the thoughts and feelings of someone who has run away from home. The third song is a lament by a teacher who has returned to the �daily classroom riot� from an idyllic month away on holiday. The final song suggests one of those energetic English folksongs that seem to have interminable verses and a refrain of nonsense words. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Each of us has stored an incalculable number of memories that become distorted, fade over time, or are forgotten.  The questions of how real are memories and when do they exist or cease to exist has fascinated me for several years.   This work is intended to speak about forgotten memories, not only personal ones, but also the countless memories that have been lost or misplaced over the millennia of human existence.  There is a melody on the solo Viola that first appears two minutes into the work; it is reiterated twice, but is coloured by other sounds on each successive rendition � perhaps like the colouring of our memories.

'Haiku', originally written for instrumental ensemble to celebrate Douglas Lilburn's eightieth birthday, was rearranged and given its first performance by the Dunedin-based Lyric Trio (Ana Good, Rebecca Maurice, Joyce Whitehead)  The haiku are concisely set; they draw on imagery both local and universal.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In 1985 Epsom Girls Grammar and Auckland Grammar Schools presented a double bill of two New Zealand plays. Under the overall title of \"Family Benefits\", the plays were \"Anyway Sweet Christmas\" by Gordon Dryland, and \"Mister Bones and Mister Jones\" by Eve Hughes. Both plays dealt with the family unit and the search for success and recognition. The latter play also demanded a certain amount of incidental music, to which were added (with the playwright's permission) several songs to amplify aspects of the action or narrative. The lyrics were written by the director Michael Evershed. \"Mister Bones and Mister Jones\" is presented as a type of minstrel show, held together by the character of \"Mister Interlocutor\" - a sort of ringmaster. Two families are contrasted : one striving for material success, while the other cares little for the trappings of contemporary society. My score for the production consisted of some twenty-two pieces of music, ranging from simple fragments to substantial songs. The music was originally scored for 6 players: flute (doubling piccolo), two clarinets (doubling alto saxophones), trumpet, and piano duet. Of the many school productions I have been music director for, this was one of the happiest and most enjoyable experiences. Since the production the music has remained unused. At times I have considered extracting a suite of pieces from it, and in early 1991 five pieces were arranged as piano duets. These orchestral arrangements were made in 2004 as part of an on-gong to project to give a new life to some of my incidental music written over the years for school productions. The first and third pieces were originally purely instrumental, whereas the other three were songs. Curtain Up! has been devised as a series of short suites suitable for school or community orchestras. The scoring is a basic classical chamber orchestra (without timpani) including two relatively simple percussion parts. Over the years I�ve written music for productions ranging from Aristophenes to Shakespeare and Arthur Millar. This is a way of giving the music a new life, and a new context.

In her original letter to me she comments that in the text �...Mary, the mother of Jesus, is likened to a mirror of Eternity�. The Carmelite Order are familiar with the this concept and it was hoped that the Carmelite Sisters would be able to use the text as part of their liturgy, especially on the Feasts of Our Lady.

The titles of the five sections give clues as to the mood of each dance, but beyond that the listener must rely on their own imagination and personal experiences to interpret the sounds.   There are elements of 'minimalist' influence in this work, with plenty of quite simple modal ideas being subtly varied in the course of repetitions.  This is especially so in the second section, which develops an idea first presented in the choral work 'As Long as Time' (No.3: \"I lie, I watch the ceiling\"). The third section is more Bartokian in style, while the fourth builds up to a cartharsis through repeated chord patterns. In the short 'Epilogue' ideas from the beginning recur, but transformed into a more peaceful setting.   Pas de Deux was commissioned and first performed by Matthew Marshall and Tony Donaldson.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This is the fifth consecutive piece for which I have taken the title from Ezra Pound's \"Cantos\".  \"And saw the waves taking form as crysta\" struck me as being particularly musical, purely in metrical and phonetic terms.  Initially, it was the phonetic content that was of particular interest to me, because I intended to break the line of poetry into its phonetic components and use these sounds as the basic material for the composition. As the listener will hear, this is, in fact, what I did.  The complete line of text, with only a slight modification, can be heard towards the end of the work, but in \"slow motion\", spread over some 60 seconds.  What precedes this \"exposition\" is its own detailed deconstruction into some 88 \"variations\", which simultaneously break down and develop its material.  These 88 events are often layered and interact in a rather complex way, so are not heard as distinct or self-contained sound objects. Although I was originally more interested in the text for its sonic qualities, while working with it I became intrigued by the image of waves \"taking form as crystal\".  It seemed like an apt metaphor for the compositional process itself, with the fluid and mobile potential of sonic material gradually crystallising into a specific gestalt, interacting and connecting with surrounding material. The water image also encouraged me to follow thorugh with an idea that I had been thinking about for some time - the notion of rhythmic fields radiating outwards from specific points in time, like ripples on the surface of a pond.  The composition contains hundreds of these \"ripple\" structures, which overlap and interact with one another.  The resulting rhythms were used to determing subdivisions of glissandi, timbral profiles and other features within the web of \"events\" that make up the composition. \"And saw the waves taking form as crystal\" was commissioned by the Radio Slovenia Chamber Choir.  It is dedicated to Uros Rojko, with thanks for his support and encouragement during my first ten years in Slovenia. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: On Tuesday morning 8th May 2007 David Farquhar died, having recently celebrated his 79th birthday.  David was one of my composition teachers when I was a student at Victoria University, and we remained in friendly contact from then on. He was a fastidious composer, and a person of integrity, generosity and humanity. I learned of his passing a few hours after his death, and was moved to write a short musical tribute to him that night. Since David's Equali for two cellos were already programmed for an Okta concert in the University of Waikato�s Gallagher Concert Chamber three days later, I utilised the same forces. Farewell is based on the notes D, A, F - David's initials. The first performance was given by James Tennant and Ros Hill on Friday 11th May 2007.  Farewell David, we salute you.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: I often use programmatic subjects in writing music, and when I began thinking about what this piece would be, one subject kept returning to me: the idea of saying goodbye to many things throughout our lives. All through our lives we see things disappear that are important to us. What I had specifically in mind, rather than the loss of loved ones, was the dwindling of ways of life. The fading of traditions, old practices, environments both natural and man-made, handed-down knowledge, and so on. Things we cherish and hold sacred from our childhood become relegated to history, and then forgotten on a regular basis. And the farewell to all that was what the piece was originally to be about.  However in November 2003, a long-time friend died suddenly, and my thoughts were turned to my farewell to him. But I did not want to make this a requiem or an elegy. It needed to have at least some glimpse of the energy and audacity with which he lived.  I have sought to bring together both the original subject, and the new. I've explored themes of resignation and resistance, reminiscence and grief, and final farewells.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In 1993 a Hungarian group called Muzsikas produced a CD of folk music entitled 'The Lost Jewish Music of Transylvannia'.  The recording was prompted by the discovery that Hungarian Jews before the war had their own distinct style of music, consisting of an amalgam of Jewish melodies with Hungarian performance style.  Up until this time there was little known evidence of this style of music, due in large part to the holocaust.  In one county, Maramaros, for instance, where 5000 families lived before World War II, there was a large Jewish orchestra and soloists.  None of these musicians survived the deportation by the Nazis.   The only older players who could be found during Muzsikas' research were two gypsies: a violinist and cimbalom player, both of whom had played for Jews before and after the war.  In addition to this, a pupil of the composer Kodaly, Zoltan Simon, had made a collection of Jewish melodies.  Drawing on these two sources, Muzsikas reconstructed the Hungarian-Jewish style that had been silenced for so long.  The CD is a moving tribute to the power of music to survive the ravages of history, and to the people who created it.   Inspired by this recording, I decided to adopt one of the Jewish melodies in my Rhapsody.  The melody is a 'Khosid Dance' (a popular dance at Jewish weddings) and appears in the second half of the piece, played on the violin while the piano accompanies with a cimbalom-like figure.  The melody becomes the subject of variations and is also mixed with fragments of earlier themes.  The use of folk melody in a piece such as this has precedent in Bartok Rhapsodies for violin and piano which date from the 1920s.   The Rhapsody begins quietly and mysteriously with a melody in the top of the piano register, which is taken over by the violin.  The violin descends into the lower register and the piano plays a theme which refers to J.S. Bach's famous chorale O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden(O Head, bleeding and wounded) from St. Matthew's Passion.  The music accelerates into the allegro section and a new theme is presented, which is restless and agitated in mood.  In contrast with this the piano plays a spiky and macabre theme, accompanied by pizzicato on the violin.  Both themes contain short motifs which are developed during the rest of the piece, and placed in counterpoint with the 'Khosid Dance' when it appears.  The vitality of the allegro becomes exhausted and the music gradually fades rather than ending.   Rhapsody was commissioned by Chamber Music New Zealand, and written for violinist, Wilma Smith and pianist, Michael Houstoun.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Risky, perhaps, to create a set of 'Lullabies', if one wants to avoid sending an audience to sleep!  But a lullaby might not always be soporific, if we consider the state of mind of the singer, who may be singing as much for themselves, projecting onto the child their own anxieties, frustrations, aspirations, hopes. The musical language tries to suggest a folk-like simplicity; the invented languages likewise hinting at distant regions � no. I African perhaps? II Turkish? III Latinate? IV Pacific? In the final movement, the word �Calumbaya� is borrowed from the name of a Filipino friend�s barrio, a name so euphonious as to be irresistible.  Invariably, mature age is a time for surrendering to seductive nostalgia and sentimentality, the very things one had previously studiously avoided. But the challenge is to find true beauty in the banal, and mystery in common clich�, something I attempted in my several settings of old songs, remembering my dear, departed paternal grandmother, and also my hale and hearty 100 year-old father, whose musical tastes extend little further than old style tunes like these. Five Lullabies was composed in 1989 as a tribute to Peter Godfrey on his retirement, and was first performed in its entirety by the Tudor Consort. Musically, they were partly inspired by my discovery of the wonderful vocal polyphonies of some of China�s minority cultures, sometimes characterised by the so-called �dissonant� interval of a 2nd being held to resonate as a consonant.

In that recording we used a �harpsichordized� piano (sheets of newspaper over grand piano strings) to give an extra �edge� to the sound; you'll see the Waiteata score says �piano or harpsichord�, and it has been performed with harpsichord.  In writing the dances, I followed the play-script for the second act, keeping to regular 8-bar dance formulas and asking the director, Richard Campion, for approximate durations for each dance; (his original estimations usually turned out to be much too short!). Only one dance, the Tango, was danced on stage; here my wife-to-be, Raydia d'Elsa, helped me by going through the steps and fitting in the dialogue. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: It had long been a desire of mine to write a cycle of choral pieces on the subject of gay love. When Stephen Bowness, conductor of Auckland�s Gay and Lesbian Singers, indicated he would be happy to have something new for their 2004 concert on the theme of love, I was delighted to take up the challenge. Originally I had intended to write for the whole choir, but the very gender specific nature of much of the poetry, made me decide to write for the men�s voices only (something the conductor was keen on anyway). The texts are all drawn from �The Penguin Book of Homosexual Verse� (edited by Stephen Coote) published more than 20 years ago. It contains a wide selection of material ranging from early Greek and Latin texts in translation, to major contemporary poets. Much gay poetry has a bittersweet quality, and much from before the late 20th century is quite depressing, although occasional gems do celebrate the subject quite openly. My selection is obviously a personal one, and designed to cover both the more serious as well as the light-hearted aspects of gay love. The texts are mainly from writers active in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The one exception is the final text which comes from Christopher Isherwood, best known for writing the original book which gave rise to the musical �Cabaret�. The first piece, �A Message�, sets a text which was written to Oscar Wilde while he was in prison. The writer wishes he could ease Wilde�s burden by providing strength and �profound repose�. The second piece �Bored� (subtitled �At a London Music�) tells of a society musical evening, although the writer�s attention is elsewhere. The third and briefest piece tells of the writer taking Gertie Green out to tea, and the consequences of her flirtation with another man. The fourth piece, �Because I liked you better� tells of the all too common problem of falling in love with someone (presumably) straight. Here the writer seems to be speaking from beyond the grave. Finally, in �On His Queerness�, a young man is recommended to see the sights of an area known as the Roman Camp, and specifically the Aquarium there. However it seems that more than fish were to be found at the Aquarium! Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Lullaby for Annabelle  Fast Dance  In memoriam, for Angela  Waltz   The Double Concerto was commissioned by Andrew Uren (bass clarinet) and Katherine Hebley (cello) with funding from Creative New Zealand.  It was designed to explore the unusal combination of solo instruments, extend the soloists and, at the same time, be performable by regional orchestras.   The opening movement has a lilting quality and is based on the Brahms' lullaby, which only appears (abridged) at the end, played on glockenspiel.  The three themes that appear in this movement are related, in some way, to this lullaby.  The movement is dedicated to my daughter Annabelle, who was born some months before the composition of this work. A short melody based on letters from her name (A-A-B-E-E) is played by the soloists in the coda.   By contrast, the second movement is fast and jagged, with a somewhat playful second theme shared between the soloists and woodwinds.  The main theme has a toccata-like quality, and builds up to a strong conclusion.   Whereas birth was the theme behind the first movement, it is death that concerns the third, and in particular the sudden death of a close friend and musician, Angela Campbell, at the time of writing this concerto.  It is an intimate piece for the two soloists only, and based on letters from Angela's name (A-G-E-A) which are heard at the beginning as a recurrent bass line.  The cello melody at the start is a variation on a melody from the first movement, suggesting birth and death are inextricably linked.   The mood lightens in the finale which is a slightly bizarre waltz based on two contrasting themes.  Near the end, the soloists have a cadenza which flows into the coda uninterrupted.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: There are two main forces shaping this work, which could be thought of as an \"internal\" force and an \"extrenal\" force.  The internal force is a process of growth that begins with a complex event heard towards the end of the composition.  Variations of this event fan out in all directions across the work's temporal space, ensuring that every event has a relationship, however distant, to every other event. The detailed crafting of each event, with its constant microscopic fluctuations in pitch and timbre, reflects the detailed activity in a spectral analysis of the title of the piece, a line from one of Ezra Pound's 'Cantos'.  This analysis is expanded to have the same duration as the composition, so that the entire work is, on one level, an elaboration of a few seconds of spectral activity.  The harmonic content of the spectrum is not, however, reflected in this rendering, but rather the morphology, with its evocative twistings, compressions and expansions. The harmonic organisation forms a third structural layer.  It originates in the first five odd numbered partials of the natural harmonic series, built on the log 'G', an octave below the bass clef.  Each partial forms the centre of a narrow band of pitches, from which the \"melodic\" material is drawnn.  Ultimately, however, the resulting contrapuntal writing is largely submerged in the surface timbral activity, as the other two structural layers tear at and distort its fabric. \"and the snow's lace is spread there like sea foam was commissioned by 175 East, with funding from Creative New Zealand.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Originally sketched in 1988, these pieces were finally completed in December 1990. They were written out of a desire to compose something fairly traditional for SSAA voices, having written \"Darkness\" in 1987 which exploited a wide range of 'extended' vocal techniques. The two main pieces are surrounded by a plainsong-like chant using words from chapter 21 of the book of Revelation where John is shown a vision of the new Jerusalem coming down from heaven. The first piece sets words from chapter 60 of Isaiah, while the second sets verse from Revelation 21. Both texts express the idea that the holy city will need neither sun nor moon, but will be lit by the glory of God. The music is essentially tonal and rhythmically straight-forward although somewhat flexible in nature. Some minor corrections and modifications were made in 2007 when the pieces were typeset, following interest from a conductor in performing them. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

I am the North Pole - poem by Tzu Yeh, 3rd-4th century  I will swallow my tears - poem by T'ang Wan, 12th century  I saw your sigh - Anon., Yuan Dynasty   Total duration:  9 minutes   I am the North Pole - Tzu Yeh, 3rd-4th century.   I cannot sleep  for the blaze of the full moon.  I thought I heard here and there  a voice calling,  hopelessly I answer 'Yes'  to the empty air.   It is night again.  I let down my silken hair  over my shoulders  and open my thighs  over my lover.  'Tell me, is there any part of me  that is not lovable?'   I had not fastened my sash over my gown  when you asked me to look out the window.  If my skirt fluttered open,  blame the spring wind.   The bare branches tremble  in the sudden breeze.  The twilight deepens.  My lover loves me,  and I am proud of my young beauty.   I am the North Pole  steady for a thousand years.  Your sun-like heart  goes east in the morning  and west in the evening.   I will swallow my tears - T'ang Wan, 12th century.   The world's love runs thin.  Human love turns evil.  Rain strips, in the yellow twilight,  the flowers from the branches.   The dawn wind will dry my tear stains.  I try to write down the trouble of my heart.  I can only speak obliquely, exhausted.  It is hard, hard.  We are each of us all alone.   Today is not yesterday.  My troubled mind sways  like the rope of a swing.  A horn sounds in the cold depth of the night.   Afraid of people's questions  I will swallow my tears  and pretend to be happy.  Deceit. Deceit. Deceit.   I saw your sigh - Anon.  Yuan dynasty.   I hold you tight in my jade white arms.  You loosen my dress and my cloud dark hair.  The tips of our tongues are cold with passion  and sweet in each other's mouths.  You whisper my name.  I whisper yours.  Frantically we kiss each other  again and again, here and there.   It is hard loving this way.  We don't dare play with each other.  All we can do is steal a few words  when nobody notices.  When there are people around  we exchange sidelong glances.   I saw your long heavy sigh.  It delighted my eyes.  But it tore my heart.   Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

It was in a programme with Mozart and I thought it would be quite fun to have the audience believe that they were going to hear a classical piece.� This is soon subverted as chromaticism takes over and the music explodes into 16 solo lines. The form of 'Sinfonietta' is unusual, in that it is loudest at the ends and empty in the middle. Out of the central calm is revealed the twelve tone melody that was the original inspiration for the piece. This gradually grows, taking the work back to its original intensity.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This set of nine piano pieces was based on the phone numbers of my colleagues in the Music Department of Victoria University in 1977, and was first performed by Margaret Nielsen that year. The idea of associating numbers with pitches is fairly standard in Western music for labelling chords, but not so much used melodically. Perhaps my first encounters with numerical gamelan notation in the 70�s may have sparked off the idea of using telephone numbers as a basis for melodic and harmonic material. The relationship I used was very simple: start with 1 on C and climb up the diatonic scale to reach E a tenth above as 0, equivalent to 10; then add sharps or flats as desired, provide a rhythm, and you�re away with the beginning of a piece.  My 1977 programme note pointed out that the pieces are �musical offerings� for the people concerned, and were not intended as portraits. The titles in fact, are deliberately non-committal; the nine pieces are arranged palidromically around a central toccata and incorporated two Echoes, two mirrors, two Rounds and two more toccatas as beginning and end. The toccatas are warm-up, try-out or show-off pieces; the Echoes make use of sympathetic resonances; the mirrors involve tunes and their upside-down versions, and the Rounds are like Rondos with repetition or variation of material.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: A sense of optimism pervades this work - remarkable considering that during the writing of it some of my worst fears were realised. I lost my father and find it hard to reconcile myself to his passing, yet he lives on in me and for that I am grateful.   To Steve and to Edwin I say farewell, too - Steve was a friend, colleague and the bass player in my band, dying tragically young in a road accident the week before my father died.  Edwin Raymond was a significant influence in my teenage years and I am only sorry that I did not write this sooner so he could have conducted it.    The piece is not, however, about death.  It is not gloomy.  The middle movements are reflective and peaceful and the outer movements are lively and rhythmic.  If there is an optimistic side of death it is that life becomes more intense and more meaningful.  The spirit of the finale is testament to this, ending the work vigorously and on an optimistic note.    The concerto was premiered on 7 November 1999 with Carol Hohauser as soloist, accompanied by the Da Capo Chamber Orchestra under conductor Mark Hodgkinson.  The concerto was revised significantly in 2002 for the Russian premiere in May 2002 with the Kuzbass Symphony Orchestra. The work was written for Carol and I thank her for her enthusiasm, musicianship and for believing in my work. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Beginnings' was commissioned by The Auckland Philharmonia. It was inspired by the birth of Ritchie's son Tristan. It depicts the slowly mounting tension of the labour, through to the birth itself. There is a gradual growth in the music from small, delicate gestures into wild and pulsating ones towards the end. The child is represented by a 'little Tristan waltz' which eventually gets caught up in the musical frenzy. The waltz sequence imposes order on the music, which tends to be fragmentary and changeable. There are some echoes of Bartok and Debussy in this early work, and it presents a good challenge for a professional orchestra.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Joe Charles came from a family with a background in writing. At various times he worked as a farmer, a publican, and in the Air Force. During his life he wrote a large number of ballads, often celebrating aspects of rural life in New Zealand during the early and middle parts of the twentieth century. His best known ballad is �Black Billy Tea� and many of his poems have been set to music, often by folk singers. The first two of the ballads set here celebrate drinking. �Running the Cutter� refers to the men left on board a ship while most of the crew were ashore. Those left behind, risking severe penalties, would sometimes �borrow a cutter� and slip ashore themselves for a quick drink. Later the term came to be used for the job of going to the nearest licensed hotel for liquor. �Moonshine� refers to the illicit whiskey normally brewed in rural areas. The needs for brewing were grain, water and secrecy, and the hills of Southland provided an ideal place for these. Many of the locals were of Irish or Scots descent, and whiskey was deemed an essential for life! The Hokonui Hills were one place where well-hidden stills made a wide range of whiskies of varying quality. �Mill Mud� was written when the author was living at Leigh in Northland. One of his neighbours had a small sawmill, and remarked about the particular smell and quality of the mud that sawmills generate. The ballad describes both the landscapes of the area as well as the sounds and smell of the sawmill. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Prelude and Toccata was written especially for the final degree recital given by Hilary Taylor in the summer of 1991 at Goldsmiths College, London.  The commission was to write a work of sufficient difficulty to warrant inclusion in a demanding programme and to show off both the performer and the instrument to full effect. The opening improvisation sets the scene, the solo flute soon joined by background chords on the piano.  This material develops into the lively and offbeat toccata with the flute very much in the dominant role and the piano providing a driving rhythmic accompaniment. In New Zealand it was recorded and broadcast on Concert FM by Carol Hohauser (flute) and Rachel Spiegel-Neumann (piano). This edition (completed in 2007) is a computer-set version (using Sibelius software) of the rather hybrid computer-set/hand-written earlier version and contains mainly revisions in notation and articulation.

I envisaged the bundle in this case as a bundle of notes from which the performer(s) can freely bring their own sensitivities, experiences and responses to the work�s realisation.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This carol was intended to capture something of the Christmas festival as it is experienced by most New Zealanders.  The first verse sets the scene in the beaches which begin to attract more and more people as the school holidays end and the warm weather arrives. The second verse describes something of the hectic shopping spree that precedes the giving of Christmas presents. The last verse relates the festival to its origins in the birth of Jesus. In a land of many trees and forests, an important feature of the celebration of Christmas has been the provision and decoration of the Christmas tree. The Pohutukawa tree flowers in December, and is sometimes referred to as \"the Christmas tree\". The last verse of the carol includes a reference to the tree that must have yielded its boughs for the cross on which the Christmas child was ultimately to perish. There are several versions of the carol; CA30 for SATB and organ, through-composed. CA30a for easy SATB (all verses to the same music) with optional organ/piano/guitar. CA30b for unison voices with simple piano or guitar accompaniment. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The central part of the text for the work is the �Prayer for Peace� which first appeared in England in the early 1980s. It is of unknown origin, and has no direct link with any particular religious or spiritual group. Added to this short text, is the �Dona nobis pacem� from the Latin Mass, and a pair of lines in the Maori language from the Anglican communion service. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The title means 'on the ebb and flow of things' and the work is based on a number of distinctive rhythmic and timbral ideas which grow and recede. One hears fluidic patterns, clear octaves with coloured resonances, shimmerings and tremolos, bird-like calls and repeated notes which move frequently at different speeds.  A feature of the work is the free open sounding passages marked 'cadenzas' for clarinet, violin, cello and horn. In two of these passages the instruments proceed independently of each other.

Prometheus is seen here as a symbol of those who challenge tyranny for the sake of mankind. By stealing fire from Olympus to give to humans, Prometheus incurred the wrath of Jupiter. He was chained to a rock where, each day, an eagle tore out his liver, and each night it grew whole again. He cursed Jupiter and was hounded by the Furies. Maui stole fire from Mahuika to give to humans and changed himself into an eagle to escape the flames. It is the energy of the curses, the hounding, the wrath of Jupiter, the flight of the eagle, the gift of fire, as well as the compassion of Prometheus and Maui that I have sought to reflect in the music.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work another commissioned work, this time by the Kaipara District Council, in honour of long time accordion and arts supporter and lifetime member of the New Zealand Accordion Association, the late Mrs. Jenny Cocurullo.  A respected and loved citizen of Dargaville, the main town in the Kaipara region in the north of New Zealand, Jenny always promoted the Kaipara as the 'Gem of the North'.  She in turn was considered 'The Gem of the Kaipara'.   Written for solo accordion with string orchestra and percussion, the Gem of the Kaipara was premiered in Dargaville on 11 May 2002, where it was performed by the Auckland Symphony with New Zealand accordion soloist Kevin Friedrich, and conducted by the composer.  Written in simple sonata form, the introduction of the piece is quite mysterious in nature, with the lower strings providing a subtle bagpipe-like drone.  The airy melody and soft percussive effects are reminiscent of the awakening of the lush majestic Kauri tree forests and countryside of the Kaipara Flats with its blanketing dawn fog.  The main themes are written around Jenny's name and the name of the region  'Kaipara'. The lyrical re-occurring melody is first heard by the accordion with string accompaniment and then switches to the string accompanied by the accordion.    After working through an animated and rhythmical jig-like section portraying Jenny's boundless energy, various interests and Scottish heritage, the strings restate the soaring melody expressing the vast expansiveness and sweeping landscapes of the Kaipara region.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: �Oriori� is the Maori word for �lullaby�, and there are many traditional chants which are labelled as such. However the starting point for this piece is a piece from the more recent tradition of European-influenced Maori music. �Hine e Hine� is a gentle lullaby attributed to Te Rangi Pai (Fanny Rose Howie 1868-1916). Under the stage name The Princess Te Rangi Pai, she toured widely overseas as a singer, having studied in London and given her debut recital in Liverpool. Ill health eventually curtailed her career after only five or six years. This set of variations on �Hine e Hine� was written in 2005 following a approach from Argentinean pianist Alicia Weingarten for some New Zealand piano music. Not having written much piano music, and nothing recently, I decided that I would write something new. Ms Weingarten had also mentioned an interest in Maori music, so I felt combining the two ideas would be an interesting challenge. The piece begins with a short prologue which develops out of some of the harmonies of the theme. Simple tonal chords are superimposed over a low pedal note. The presentation of the theme is done is an already quite decorated manner. Constant semiquavers surround the theme in the upper parts of the texture. The first variation continues in similar manner, but with faster patterns of notes surrounding the theme. The second variation is more dramatic, echoing some of the chordal ideas of the prologue. The third variation is a slow and lyrical melody which develops out of the shape of the opening notes of �Hine e Hine�, set over an ostinato in the left hand. The fourth and final variation is a fast and light scamper again developing ideas from the opening notes of the theme�s melody. Towards the end of this variation the music is interrupted by bold chords derived from the harmonic and melodic ideas of the final phrases of the theme. The piece ends with a return to the music of the prologue, presented with few changes until an extended ending section which includes a final hint of the theme�s music.

Sharon Joy Vogan subsequently recorded the work for Concert FM.   The one continuous movement is divided into seven sections, linked by recurring motifs.  Five of these sections describe dreams, while the opening and closing sections represent the gradual drifting off to sleep, and waking from sleep, respectively.   Rather than being specifically programmatic, Night-piece attempts to evoke strongly-felt sensations and emotions from the the sub-conscious mind.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Viola Concerto was written while Ritchie was Composer-in-Residence with the Dunedin Sinfonia in 1994, and first performed in Dunedin the following year, with Donald Maurice as the soloist.  It is a personal work in which the viola takes on various characters, and describes human relationships.  The solo part speaks in a natural and uncontrived voice, and consequently there are few shows of virtuosity in the concerto.   The first movement, allegro tempestuoso, opens in turmoil and includes an idea inspired by one of Bach's Brandenburg concertos.  A lighter, folk-like theme emerges and acts as a link to the second main theme which is cooler in mood and tinged with sadness.  In the middle section a new idea is played on muted brass interspersed with a lyrical melody on viola. Themes are developed in the orchestra, reaching a climax and leading back to the home key of E.  At this point melodic ideas are transformed by a downward, 'weeping' motif which appeared earlier on.  This carthartic passage fades and the movement ends quickly, without resolution.   The long theme at the start of the slow movement began life as a solo piece, and unfolds slowly on the dorian mode accompanied by simple string chords.  The stronger second theme on G has a determined quality about it.  A lyrical third theme appears on the woodwinds and uses elements of the opening melody.  Ominous rumbles in the bass signify the start of the middle section. A boisterous climax evaporates into the recapitulation, where the opening melody is varied with soft floating flutes and string harmonics. The third movement, a cadenza, follows and acts as a link to the finale.   Dance-like in character, the finale provides a resolution to the tensions of the previous movements.  Some of the themes are influenced by popular music styles, and near the end there is a slightly slower section which recalls Bluegrass music; this was inspired by the American group, the Blue Sky Mountain Boys.  There are three main themes in the movement, and these are combined in counterpoint towards the end.  A long pedal note E appears in the Coda, over which the soloist plays a mock-heroic version of the second theme.  This is brusquely swept aside by strident and jazzy chords, and the concerto comes to a conclusion.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

One might imagine the sounds of wind and water, and birdsong, and the dim outlines of rugged coastlines and bush-covered hills. These shadows come in and out of focus, against the backdrop of  the work�s technical explorations. Formally, there is an emphasis organisation at the sonic level, and particularly the way in which accumulations of timbres, densities and textures change over time. Each player is a soloist, while at the same time ever-changing instrumental groupings fuse into composite sound-masses. There is a constant tension between these shifting masses and the virtuosic individual lines which scatter around them.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The mood of the earlier piece however is quite different, being slower and meditative; here by contrast it is monumental and militaristic.  The piece�s opening on the other hand is much gentler; a spacious melody is heard over the sustained broken chords of the secondo part. I am indebted to Andy Gomez for the jazz riff upon which it is based.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This cycle was written at the request of Dunedin soprano Judy Bellingham. It represents my first extended writing for solo voice and piano, something which is perhaps surprising given my substantial choral output. Ursula Bethell (1874-1945) was born in England, grew up in New Zealand, then spent most of her early adult life in England and Europe. In the 1920�s she returned to live in Christchurch, establishing a garden and becoming a focus for the city�s literary life. She began to write poetry from the age of fifty. It has been suggested that her poetry was influenced by Whitman and Hopkins, and she has been called �the truest colonial voice New Zealand possesses�. I am grateful to my colleague at Epsom Girls Grammar School, Dr Dot Neutze, for offering the following interpretive comments on the cycle: I�m sure (the cycle) comes from Bethell�s looking westward from her �limen amabile� on the Port Hills, and watching the sun set over the Southern Alps. Section I describes the physical scene at sunset, rather grandly as she is leading up to God (�Light of Lights�). She watches the last light of day give way to �all-encompassing dark�. In Section II the lights of mankind (Christchurch and the settlements of the Canterbury Plains) provide �choirs of golden lights�, but they are only �sparks� in the �deepening dark...deepening night�. In Section III, as it gets darker, the �antiphonal stars� take up the song, extending the music to the lights of the whole universe: �imperial orbs...moons...planets of magnitude...suns to suns reply...serene to serene stars�. In Section IV heavenly beings take up the mortal Christians� evening hymns �at the time of lamp-lighting�. While �pastoral ministers sleep� the �bright clair-audient angels� continue the praises of the �Master of Music�. The hymn of praise in Section V deals with the deepest Christian mysteries, the paradox of the Creator who became mortal: �Almighty Artificer...human heart�. It�s the light shining in darkness �put out for a night� in crucifixion and �rising mightily� to become the light of the Holy City. At the climax of the hymn �our lights� are consumed in the light of heaven. After the power of this universal hymn of praise the sequence needs the simplicity of word (and rhyme) in Section VI to bring the poem back to the reality of the physical scene: �hidden seas and river...the silent night�, and the darkness of the plains. In Bethell�s poem it shows a reluctance to let go of the vision, a sadness that we are only human. The words seem to tumble over each other, almost in anticlimax, as a very quick winding down. Musically the cycle develops from the opening piano gesture. It provides a starting point for much of the melodic and harmonic material. Each section of the cycle begins at the point at which the previous section concluded by picking up on some musical element from its concluding bars. Sections II and VI are most closely linked musically with material from the earlier part reappearing in an altered guise in the later part. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Quintro' was conceived as an electroacoustic, real-time performance work  using a standard acoustic  composition for five double basses along with the MAX  or Pro Tools computer program, for electro-  acoustic enhancement. Either electroacoustic enhancement, or a performance with straight and  unprocessed acoustic sound can be employed at the performers� discretion.  �Quintro� is designed to  showcase unlimited aspects in sound production for the double bass either way.  Basses 2& 4 work as a unit and should be placed together on one side of the stage, opposite basses  3& 5, who also work as a unit.  Solo bass 1 should then be located in the middle of the stage, between  the two groups.  The three movements are titled:  1. Smooth Flow  2. Ebb 3. Return 'Smooth Flow' begins the musical voyage in a relaxed, unhurried manner with the solo over top of a  constant quaver flow spread throughout the ensemble. The structure includes a retrograde in the solo  from mid-way to the end.  'Ebb' is largely abstract, with eerie glissando harmonics and low pedal drones. The ensemble conveys a  sense of improvisation, in contrast to the steady cross-rhythms  and melody of the outer movements.  Improvisation of any sort by the performers is encouraged by the composer for this movement.  �Return� picks up the pace for a speedy journey home. The constant, but faster quaver flow keeps the  momentum while the solo alternates different melodies and effects over the top. The work ends with a  recapitulation of a pizzicato segment from the �smooth flow� melody, at bar 34 of the first movement.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Nerve follows on from my recent work, where I became fascinated by the possibilities of microtonality. Like the previous work, Duos, Nerve explores the immense range of permutations possible when instruments capable of microtonality and a continuous range of pitch, are combined with an instrument like the piano with its range of discrete pitches. In Nerve, I was able to complicate the concept further with the addition of percussion, which while largely limited in this set up to instruments of discrete pitch, also adds a much wider range of �un-pitched� or �indistinct pitched� sounds. This shifting harmonic world, with its two sides simultaneouly complementing and pulling against each other, provides much of the impetus for the work. The title is a reference to the way I perceive the material being passed from instrument to instrument, in a constant stream which, due to the differing harmonic possibilities of the  instruments, is constantly reorganised, though initially all drawn from the same cells.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Hinetekakara is the ancestress of Aroha Yates-Smith, the kaikaranga (singer) who provided the idea and the text of this piece. Hinetekakara lived on the shores of Lake Rotorua with Ihenga, her husband or father, an eponymous ancestor of the Te Arawa people, when the land was still being settled after the arrival of the Te Arawa canoe from central Polynesia.   The four cadenzas, for bassoon, alto flute, flute, cello and bassoon, and bassoon link improvised sections, in which all the instruments participate. The singer initially invokes, accompanied by putatara (conch shell trumpet), the spirit of Hinetekakara, then addresses rituals following the death of her future father-in-law (with putorino), and then the birth of her son (with pumotomoto, an instrument used to assist at child-birth). A voiceless improvisation on pupu harakeke (flax snail), an instrument presaging danger, is followed by Ihenga's anguished lament as he finds the murdered body of Hinetekakara by the lake, by the place named for her, Ohinemutu, meaning the end of the woman. Finally, she is farewelled as her spirit returns to the afterworld.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

It was intended for a �mid-winter Christmas� concert which was to also feature Britten�s �A Ceremony of Carols�. I therefore felt happy to turn to Christmas texts with some of the more traditional Christmas references (snow etc). The first text is from the fifteenth century and is a general text mentioning Mary, the manger, the wise men, and the gifts they brought, and ends with call to delight in the Christ child. The second text, by G.K. Chesterton contains images of snow and night, and ends with the line that gives the work its overall title. The third text is a variant of the carol �I saw three ships come sailing in� and may refer either to the medieval myth that Joseph and Mary travelled to England, or obliquely to purported journeys of the relics of the wise men. The fourth text is a lullaby by nineteenth century poet John Addington Symonds. Again the wise men and their gifts are mentioned along with the shepherds. The final text is another anonymous one, and is simply a brief and energetic welcome to �heaven�s King�. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Clive Aucott wrote \"My Darling Dove\" for his wife in 1997, the first year of their marriage. As a polyphonic composition, it owes much of its style to the English madrigal tradition. It is essentially in the Dorian mode, where the prevailing D tonality represents the \"D\" of \"Darling\" and \"Dove\" in the title. At the end of 1997, this piece ws entered in the composition competition for the 41st International Festival of Choral Art at Jihlava in the Czech Republic. It won a place for the festival and was performed by Luscinia Opava, a Czech youth choir, in the Baroque church of St. Ignatus in Jihlava on 26 June. In 1999, it became the obligatory test piece for the 4th International Festival of Youth Choirs in Opava and Brno in the Czech Republic. Since then, a number of choirs have performed it in Europe and New Zealand. For example, Peter Godfrey performed it with his Kapiti Chamber Choir at the Paraparaumu College Auditorium on 3 July 2005. Currently, it may be found on repertoire lists posted on the World Wide Web.    Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The setting is both the rural landscape of Porangahau, Hawkes Bay, and then a military hospital in Crete during World War 2. The first song, �Nga te Aroha� is about Waru and Angie�s exchange of gifts (greenstone and a painting of �Nga Puke�). The second song, �Taku Hoa Aroha�, is Angie�s love song for Waru, as he lies wounded in a Crete hospital. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: �Of all the discoveries made by Mariner 9, one of the most impressive was an enormous volcano, twice as high as Everest and five hundred kilometres across the base. It was located at a spot which the old map-makers, peering at the tiny telescopic image of Mars, had noted as being of unusual brilliance, and had given the astonishingly prescient name �Nix Olympica�, the Snows of Olympus.�  (Arthur C. Clarke) While the title provided the impetus for this work, it is not intended to be strictly programmatic � rather, I have sought to establish a mood (or perhaps a �landscape�) which each title suggested to me. �Nix Olympica� was written at a time when I was becoming very interested in minimalism in musical composition, and much of the material reflects this. Minimalist works are usually built from a small amount of melodic or rhythmic material repeated many times, often with only slow subtle changes. Although the work is quite active rhythmically (especially the middle section) it is harmonically quite static. The first of the three sections (which follow each other without a break) establishes B flat as its tonal centre, and presents fragments of material which occur later in the work. The second section uses G as its rallying point with a secondary focus on B flat (a minor 3rd above G). The music consists of a series of ideas which gradually lengthen, framed by a structure of major subdivisions which come closer and closer together. The third section moves to an E minor tonality (a minor 3rd below G) and consists of a long languid melody played throughout by the clarinet. This music is derived from an independent work for flute, percussion and organ written at the 1985 Cambridge Music School. Throughout the work there is a preference for middle and upper-range timbres from all the instruments, but with few �extended playing techniques�. �Nix Olympica� was commissioned by the Music Federation of New Zealand (now Chamber Music New Zealand) for the Auckland Wind Quartet and pianist David Guerin. It was premiered by these performers in 1986. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The piece is a relatively light-hearted reflection on the journey from birth through childhood to adolescence. It opens with birth-pains and a reference to Stravinsky's famous ballet, The Rite of Spring. This reference is a source of ideas for melodies and motifs that follow, filtered through the use of a magic square. The main theme of the first section is a quirky 12-note idea on the violin, followed by a more driving theme. A passage of plucked notes leads to another 12-note theme on bassoon. These themes are developed, and build into a wild dance, one of two dance-like passages in the work that owe a debt to Transylvanian folk music. They symbolize the life force that is only too apparent in young children.   The frisky, playful first section gives way to a short bassoon solo, leading to a slow middle section, marked 'mesto' or sad. A simple idea on the strings reflects a sense of loneliness, reinforced by bassoon melody that follows. A short double bass solo near the end is rudely interrupted by the opening of the third section, and a brief introduction leads to a lively 12-note theme on the violins. This toccata-like section is highly energetic in character, and includes a long-range accelerando in the dance passage.  When the main theme returns it is abridged and channeled into a short, changeable coda.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This short work was commissioned for the choir of Rosmini College in Auckland. Conductor Christine Treseder-Hallett, and Head of Music Sue Williams, asked for a work for male voices that was limited to three-part choir, with the possibility of some solos for featured voices. Once again I�ve turned to traditional spirituals from the African American tradition for my text. This short text is typical with its repeated refrain of �bye and bye� and looks forward to a future time when �every day will be Sunday�. The accompani-ment features a �walking bass� against which the right hand has considerable syncopation. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

There are references to the �veldt� and a clear distinction between the life expectation of whites and blacks. The story is a simple one � a small black baby is found by passing white people, taken home and grows up amongst his adoptive people. The moral of the story is that �...things go deeper than white or black�. �The True History of Resurrection Jack� was written for Claire Caldwell and the Dilworth Foundation Singers of Dilworth School in Auckland.

Off one shape, more of the same shapes unravel, and then off these in turn, tiny parts of the frond unravel, and so on.  From the moment of 'birth', the gradual cycle continues until the magnificent tree fern is towers, quite different from its original form and the koru is still present.  In this piece I've explored slow metamorphosis, with the aim to grow sounds out of each other with contrasting results.  Diatonic chords out of chromatic clusters, beauty out of chaos.  All of this begins from a single note, f, at the start which is born out of string harmonics and imperceptible pitches, and concludes with hint that the cycle an ongoing one.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This music was originally commissioned by Richard Campion for the New Zealand Players' production of �Ring Round the Moon� by Jean Ahhouil, translated by Christopher Fry. In the second act there is a ball taking place offstage and demanding a large number of dances which are specified in the text. The music was first recorded on acetate discs by a ad hoc orchestra led by Alex Lindsay; these small recordings were then played through speakers for the production, sounding very loud to the cast but filtering out more gently to the audience. At the end of the long national tour, the cast know the music very well and suggested to me that I should do something with it. The result, some years later, 1957, was a suite of nine dances first performed by the Alex Lindsay Orchestra.  This rapidly became my most performed piece and was commercially recorded by the Alex Lindsay Orchestra in the 1960s, a recording still available today from Kiwi Pacific Reords. Ashley Heenen, through the NZ APRA Committee, commissioned an arrangement for full orchestra for the NZ Youth Orchestra to take on a tour of Europe and China in 1975. This version was shortened to six dances by leaving out the first three numbers. The music has also been used for a ballet, The Wintergarden, choreographed by Arthur Turnbull for the Royal New Zealand Ballet Company - this version included a tenth dance not in the 1957 Suite. Since 1975 two further version have been commissioned: Waltz Suite (1989), for string orchestra (five dances) for the Nova Strings, and an arrangement of the original Dance Suite� (1992) for violin and piano (nine dances) for Isador Saslav.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The four songs were originally sketched in 1989 as a response to a number of requests from teachers in primary and intermediate schools for NZ choral music suited to that age group. Nearly all my choral output has been written for mixed voices, or in case of treble-voice music, written at a difficulty level beyond that manageable by young singers. The songs stayed in rough sketch form until 1992 when they were finally put into a more performable format with the aid of a music printing programme. A second volume of another four songs followed in 1994. The texts of these four songs are all drawn from an anthology of New Zealand poetry produced for schools in the early 1970's called \"These Islands\". The title also seemed appropriate for this collection of songs, being taken from the following lines of poetry by Denis Glover: Sing all things sweet or harsh upon These islands in the Pacific sun... The four songs in this collection use texts by some of NZ's best known poets: James K. Baxter, Katherine Mansfield, Denis Glover and Joe Charles (only the last being a somewhat less than familiar name). They range from a song about a typical '�character�� of New Zealand�s past, through two songs about the weather, to a song about a swagman brewing up tea in a billy. The songs have been written for unison voices, but with an optional harmony part. For most of the songs this second part can be taken as either a vocal or instrumental line (or a combination of the two), or omitted entirely. The piano part has been conceived for pianists of a modest ability level. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Ray was born in England and lived through seven years of destruction, spending many nights in air raid shelters listening to the sounds of total war. An air raid, with its sirens, the drone of bombers, bombs dropping and anti-aircraft fire can be heard in the first movement. The main theme, which occurs soon after the opening, reappears inverted after the air raid - symbolic of the utter chaos prevelant at that time. However, like the Phoenix rising from the ashes, the theme not only corrects itself but changes from minor to major modality near the end. The second movement represents New Zealand with its bitter-sweet memories for the composer. New Zealand is a beautiful country. The humerous third movement, called \"England again\" is scored pizzicato throughout, and leads to the final movement \"Canada\" - big Canada, magnificent Canada, vast Canada, noble Canada, free Canada, beautiful Canada.... the huge but simple harmonies near the end are Ray's interpretation of the optimism he feels for the country.

Firstly, I have explored the foreboding nature of the building; the way it looks as though it were melting, twisting and almost lurching as it towers over you. Then in the second movement the music takes us on a winding journey down from the bell towers. Taking delight in the beautiful fa�ades, shapes, glass and mosaics on the way.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: As conceived by Peter Schat, the Tone Clock is a formalization of the observation that, within the twelve-note chromatic system, there are twelve possible triads (i.e. groups of three notes, differentiated by the size of the intervals between them - the classical major and minor triads being two of the twelve), and that each of these triads may be transposed three times to give all twelve notes of the chromatic scale, without repetitions. Schat likened the twelve different triads, and their characteristic sonorities, to the twelve hours shown on a clock face, hence the name. McLeod saw in this an effective method for describing harmonic fields in any music using the chromatic system, and found that it helped explain choices she had made unconsciously in her own compositions. She expanded Schat�s system beyond the triads, to take into account every possible combination of intervals in all possible sizes of note groups. These piano pieces were the first works McLeod wrote after investigating the Tone Clock, and she achieved with them an unusually high level of personal expression. The first piece was written for David Farquhar�s sixtieth birthday, and the fifth for Olivier Messiaen�s eightieth birthday. Interestingly, the third piece is based entirely upon the harmonic movements in the first prelude in Bach�s Well-tempered Clavier, when applied to the extended harmonic world of the Tone Clock.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: When I chanced upon a copy of the book �The Dragons are Singing Tonight� I was immediately entranced by the poems and struck by their possibility for musical setting. Jack Prelutsky is an American poet, whose poetry for children is highly regarded and widely anthologized. Although not a cycle, the poems have a sense of progression through the book. I have tried to retain that same kind of logical progression in my selection of about half of the original set of poems. The first two movements are performed without a break between them. The brief opening section serves as a caution to the listener and is followed by a description of one�s thoughts while waiting for a dragon egg to hatch. The third poem was initially set for treble voices for the choirs of Westlake Girls High School in Auckland. Although it was not originally intended for this work, I finally decided I liked it too much to leave out! �Boom! the thunder dragon� is a purely instrumental description of the dragon who claims �I am Boom the thunder dragon, taller than the tallest trees, I stir mighty whirlwinds when I whisper, mighty cyclones when I sneeze...�. The fifth piece is a lament by a dragon who is tired of being �repulsive, despicable, ruthless and fierce...�. Unfortunately he realises he can�t change his nature! One of the early concert reviews of the work suggested that the work �went into a more pensive mood� in the second half. Therefore I�ve incorporated into the score �I Have a Dozen Dragons� between the original fifth and sixth movements. This was originally written for treble voices as an independent piece, and here retains that use of just the sopranos and altos. It�s a lively tale of someone buying a dozen (very small) dragons at the mall. The following piece gives the work its title and tells of the dragons awaking in their underground lair for their one special night of the year. The final movement suggests that while dragons were once believed in, their time is now over and they�ve lived their last. Or have they? �The Dragons are Singing Tonight� was commissioned by Auckland Choral Society (conductor: Peter Watts) with funding provided by Creative New Zealand. It was written for a combined concert with one of the country�s top brass bands. The orchestral version was made in 2006 for the same choir to perform in its 2007 concert season. The texts from �The Dragons are Singing Tonight� are used by kind permission of the poet and Greenwillow Books, New York (a division of Harper Collins). �The Dragons are Singing Tonight� was first performed on 29 June 1996 by Auckland Choral Society and Fosters Auckland Brass, conducted by Peter Watts.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Widow's Songs (2004) consist of three settings of poems by Cilla McQueen, taken from her cycle of poems called 'Rope'. They attempt to describe thoughts and feelings of a woman grieving for her dead husband.  In the process, surrounding images and activities seem to take on extra meaning.  In the second song, for example, making bread becomes too difficult to do because of the memories it stirs.  The style of the songs is intimate and aims to exploit the beauty of the voice to evoke feelings.  Widow's Song is one of several works by Ritchie inspired by Cilla McQueen's poems, including an opera called The Trapeze Artists and the well-known song Dogwobble.  These songs were commissioned by Tower NZ Youth Choir, for performance by the a capella chamber choir, Tower Voices New Zealand. It was written for a premiere performance in the Otago Arts festival, October, 2004.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: OCTET:INFILTRATION begins as two quartets, one of wind and the other of strings.  The wind group is displaced from the central performance area, so the timbral groupings are initially delineated both in time and space.  The process of the piece is that of the wind players one by one \"infiltrating\" the string group.  This accounts for the four solos which form the second section of the piece, often coloured and embellished by the instruments that are already part of the main group.  The unaccompanied clarinet solo leads to the main body of the piece where the ensemble functions as a whole.  Here material previously hinted at crystalises into a series of interrelated textures and gestures.  OCTET: INFILTRATION was composed in Siena, italy, while the composer was studying with Franco Donatoni at the Accademia Musical Chigiana in July and August 1992.  It was premiered in Siena by Octandre, directed by Giorgio Magnanensi. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

All the poems are by American poet Jack Prelutsky whose poems I�ve set on a number of occasions beginning with �The Dragons are Singing Tonight� in 1996. His children�s poetry is widely anthologized and highly regarded for its quirky and humorous views on life. Each poem describes a small aspect of being a brother or a sister. The first simply describes a brother who likes to doodle�,everywhere! In the second poem there�s the heart-felt frustration of a child who is no longer the centre of attention due to the arrival of a younger sister. The third poem describes the building of a robot and the chaos that ensues. In the fourth poem the poet plays on the idea of the word �orange� being both a thing and a colour. The final poem tells of a pet bug, a harmless creature which met an unfortunate fate. The songs are written with young singers in mind. They are tuneful, avoid extremes of range and intervals, and have relatively straightforward accompaniments. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work attempts to shake off 'the blues' with playful and vigorous musical ideas.  It starts slowly and in sombre mood but this is quickly swept aside by a jolting 'allegro'.  A number of motivic-like themes are presented, and linked together during the piece.  The syncopated idea at the beginning recurs as a kind of rondo theme in this one-movement work.   'Goodbye to Blues' was commissioned by the Christchurch Youth Symphonic Band and CSM, with funding from Creative NZ.  It was first performed on the band's tour of Hawaii, in 1992.  While presenting some challenges to younger players it is not overly demanding in terms of technique.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This string quartet is performed as one movement. The first section is predominantly contrapuntal, including the opening bars where each performer sings �Aue� (meaning �Alas!�, a Maori acclamation in some waiata tangi). The work continues with a section which features solo cello, followed by dance and song-like sections. Much of the work is based on the intervals of a minor third, semitone and tone. Karanga, Maori song-calls performed by women on the marae to welcome or farewell people, are one source of inspiration for this piece. A characteristic musical feature of karanga is a long drawn out cry (glissando). Since there is often more than one caller on the marae, it is not uncommon for the calls to overlap. This work was commissioned by the Hutt Valley Chamber Music Society, with fundng provided by the Queen Elizabeth 11 Arts Council. In October 1994 the New Zealand String Quartet gave its premiere performance at Lower Hutt. �String Quartet� (1994) is dedicated to the memory of May Manoy (1913-1993), a lifelong friend who was also an enthusiastic supporter of chamber music in Wellington since the late 1940s.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Symphony in Five Movements' was composed in Auckland in 1995/96 for the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra as part of its Composer-in-Residence programme. It was first performed on the 1st August 1996 in a concert at the Aotea Centre, Auckland as part of a Main Series programme. A central idea to the 'Symphony' concerns aspects of timing. Its form was partially inspired by the martial arts treatise 'Go Rin No Sho' (A Book of Five Rings), which considers timing and its relationship to strategy.  The five books are: Ground, Water, Fire, Wind & Void. There is a loose correspondence between the inspiration behind some of the movements and each of the �books.� Thus, the third movement refers to the book of tradition �wind,�and consequently, is modelled on a scherzo, not only paying tribute to Beethoven, but in a broader sense indicating the desire to give the entire work a historical reference.  The Introduction or first movement is analogous to the �ground� book (the path), outlining the Symphony�s musical ideas. The fifth movement (�void�) has a strongly rhythmic structure with contemporary influence throughout, reflected in, and overlayed with its violin-based lyrical stream. This strongly linear work was described by Denys Trussell in a subsequent review for 'Quote Unquote' after its Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra performance in 1996 (conducted by Enrique Diemecke) as being \"rich with feeling and atmosphere.\" The fourth and fifith movements were given a reading by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra conducted by Hamish McKeich at the NZSO - SOUNZ Readings in October 2001 in Wellington.

In particular, the dance focuses on the Maori legend about the old woman, Muriranga-whenua, and the younger, sometimes mischevious Maui. �Wahine Toa� was choreographed by Keri Kaa, Jan Bolwell and Sunny Amey, commissioned with assistance from the Queen Elizabeth 11 Arts Council of New Zealand.  �Muriranga-whenua� played by Catherine Bowie was recorded for the CD �Matairangi - Helen Fisher Chamber Music� and is available at SOUNZ, the Centre for New Zealand Music.  The score is also included in �Little Dancings�, a selection of flute music published by the Centre for New Zealand Music. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'After Resonance Blues' explores the Korean idea of aftertone via interval-colour resonances and string after tones (partial un-dampening, prepared bass strings) as well as a Japanese intensification structure. Both of these relate to the idea of timbre grittiness and chordal intensification structure of the twelve-bar structure/grittiness in the blues. A spacious fourth resonance, very slow, at the very opening eventually opens out into a frenetic paced fifths sequence using blues riff patterns but intermingled with an interval-colour richness at the end-time climax. An after resonance string stimulation returns at the end to mirror the beginning prepared notes. The work contains transformed elements of Korean Ritual music; the mood is tinged with lyric sadness (\"blue\") in that it reflects an inner emotion over the death of a Korean friend's father prior to embarking on the work.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Poem by Bub Bridger   for mixed choir with optional trebles and piano (4 hands)   Bub Bridger started writing poetry after visiting the river which Douglas Bridge spans in Northern Ireland. Johnny Come Dancing was one of her first poems and tells the story of a man's magic encounter with fairies and his subsequent emmigration to New Zealand.  Johnny in the poem was, in fact, Bub Bridger's father, and she assures me the story is true.  The combination of magic and music in the poem appealed to me greatly, and made me want to set it for this commission.  The song uses Irish dance rhythms to underpin the largely modal vocal lines.  The third verse adopts a different style, however,  with reference to the old-style 'glees'(male part-singing).  In the end, the dance rhythms return to drive the music to a climactic ending.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: During the composition of 'Pivotal Orbits', I was influenced by the sensual imagery of the following passage in Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer:  The earth is not an arid plateau of health and comfort, but a great sprawling female with velvet torso that swells and heaves with ocean billows; she squirms beneath a diadem of sweat and anguish. Naked and sexed she rolls among the clouds in the violet light of the stars. All of her�blazes with furious ardour. She moves amongst the seasons and the years with a grand whoopla that seizes the torso with paroxysmal fury, that shakes the cobwebs out of the sky; she subsides on her pivotal orbits with volcanic tremors.  'Pivotal Orbits' is a portrayal of this tectonic restlessness and movement, existing in a lush sound environment, tied together by three recurring ideas that are in constant developmental flux. 'Pivotal Orbits' was premiered by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra (conductor Kazufumi Yamashita) at the Asian Music Festival, Tokyo, September 2003.  It has since been played in a SOUNZ/NZSO Readings, conductor Hamish McKeich. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

This orchestral suite was arranged for the 1965 Cambridge Summer Music  School, and first performed there by the school�s orchestra.  The translation from piano to orchestral sounds makes many opportunities for  variety of colours and for real sostenuto. But while orchestral sound is bound to  be very different, I have attempted in the Trio of the Mexicana to capture  something of the effect of the piano�s harmonic resonoctet to provide sustaining echoes of the oboe�s tune.

While this work maintains a strong Maori theme, with karanga, haka and waiata, as well it weaves in other Pacific and European elements. This work for school choir, instrumentalists, dancers and kapa haka, composed with the financial assistance of a composition grant from Queen Elizabeth 2 Arts Council, was first performed by 140 students from South Wellington Intermediate School  in July 1992 for Artsplash, the Wellington Young People�s Festival.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: I have many reasons to thank Peter Nisbet, the General Manager of the NZ Symphony, who, through the 70�s and �80s, passed a series of commissions my way. How privileged I was to be invited to write for the best ensemble in the country! 'Little Elegies' was a particularly prestigious commission, with the concert recorded for telecast to the nation. I successfully argued that my piece, commissioned to mark the 25th anniversary of television in New Zealand, should exploit the medium itself, not simply be a telecast of the orchestral performance. And so, with the help of that wild man of television production, Peter Coates, we produced, at great speed and with few resources, an experimental video that inter-cut slow motion gestures of the conductor with what were sometimes quite harrowing topical television news clips. I don�t recollect what the reaction was to our provocative creation � perhaps nothing more than the Great Silence with which all New Zealand artists are familiar!  Although this work was commissioned as a celebration, I chose a sombre tone, to draw attention to some of the darker aspects of the popular media, particularly the trivialisation of human tragedy as mass entertainment. I had been deeply shocked after reading Dith Pran�s book �The Killing Fields� and seeing the movie of the same title, and felt that any kind of personal statement I could make would be insignificant besides the enormity of the horror; hence the �littleness� of my elegies for the suffering of the Cambodian people. In its first performance, 'Little Elegies' was conducted by Jose Serebrier. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The opening slow movement could easily be the wide-open vistas, the distant white horizon, the isolation sensed in the explorers' huts or even just the biting cold.  Or maybe all of the above rolled into one.  The ensuing dance episode is rather lugubrious - without mechanical aid, humans move slowly on �The Ice� and the wildlife, such as it is, suffers similar awkwardness.  Never far away is the changeable weather, bringing horrendously strong winds one minute, bright sunshine the next.  The finale captures the whirling bluster and activity of an Antarctic storm and the mechanical rhythms from my first chopper ride. One of course takes what one wants from listening to a piece of music and it is not meant to be a programmatic work as such but perhaps I really do mean to depict the clowning of penguins, or at least to capture the humorous element from it amidst such a bleak landscape.  Certainly, the landscape and the emotions it opened up helped shape the overall work.   I am indebted to Antarctica New Zealand for the opportunity to travel to Antarctica and gain the inspiration essential for the creation of my work. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'The Tempest' is Shakespeare's most musical play; as Caliban says \"...the isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs....\". Its musical demands include many songs and many magic effects, storms and a celestial masque. Strangely, while many composers ( including myself !) have written incidental music for the play, there have been very few operatic adaptions. Yet the fable contains all the operatic ingredients of romance, intrigue and comedy with lots of magic thrown in - is the happy ending a drawback!? There is also an important theme of freedom present, as the 'tangata whenua' of the island, Caliban and Ariel, struggle to get free from their slavery to Prospero. They finally succeed, and Prospero himself in the Epilogue asks the audience to \"set him free\" to leave magic and the stage, just as Shakespeare is also signalling his retirement from play-writing.  My adaption of Shakespeare has reduced his text to about a quarter of the original, and five acts to three - the details of cast, scoring and duration are given on the cover overleaf.  Act 1 starts with the storm,  presents Prospero's story so far and his relationships to Miranda, Ariel and Caliban, and ends with Ferdinand's arrival and his falling in love with Miranda. Act 2 is in five symmetrical scenes - courtiers, \"comics\", lovers, \"comics\", courtiers -, and presents the intrigues aimed at killing King Alonso and Prospero, but thwarted by Ariel.  Act 3 provides more magic ( Prospero's masque of spirit godesses, celebrating the lovers' betrothal), and leads to the denoument, where Prospero assembles everyone, forgives the would-be murderers, and announces the departure of all the the visitors to celebrate Miranda and Ferdinand's wedding in Naples. The Epilogue (originally for Prospero alone), is adapted as a vaudeville finale for the entire cast, ending with the everyone adding clapping to their singing, and inviting the audience to join in.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Variations for Violin and Piano' was written in 1982 while Nigel Keay was studying composition at Victoria University of Wellington. The work won the inaugural Composition Competition there in 1982, being played on that occasion by Bruce Corlett (violin) & Hugh Stevenson (piano). It is a single movement work, and although tied in with the formal study requirements of the day, the piece saw the establishment of a personal style and harmonic language that developed along a path of �atonality� during the eighties. In fact the composer considers that this work marks the beginning of his catalogue. Nigel Keay played the violin part of this essentially abstract piece shortly after it was written, reflecting his desire to create a work that would be enjoyed by its performers.

I am grateful to Robert Craft and the Stravinsky Estate for permission to use it here. Stravinsky's melody is played by the first trumpet in each of the three chorale settings. All three are canonic in treatment, with the texture increasing from two parts in Chorale 1 to four parts (plus a tuba bass-line) in Chorale 3.  The two Interludes take off from the finale notes of the chorale. In contrast both are quick, with a somewhat Stravinskian rhythmic exhuberance; Interlude 1 is scored for a trio (excluding the two trumpets), Interlude 2 for the full quintet.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Tango Suite' was commissioned by Radio France in July 2002 and completed in October of the same year. Written immediately after 'Serenade for Strings', 'Tango Suite' also employs a string ensemble but with a contralto voice added. The commission for Alla Br�ve determined that the group would be relatively small, however the double bass gives a very deep and solid character to the music. From about 1995 Nigel Keay had been writing a very \"deep-toned\" music, and this is reflected in the Viola Concerto of 2000 in which he uses a contrabassoon in a chamber orchestra, often taking the instrument down to the bottom of its range. This idea is extended and the instrumentation of string quintet (standard string quartet + double-bass) is used in 'Tango Suite'.  The five pieces, are strongly influenced by the traditional roots of Argentinean tango. As there were four forms to be considered (tango, milonga, candombe, valse), Tango Suite is a work composed close to the true spirit of tango, but in the context of a personal musical language. The pieces of the 'Suite' differ not only through the forms that they use, or are inspired by, but also by their tempi. 1. \"TANGO\", a tango, is the slowest of the suite. The initial resolve of chord/key at the beginning, takes the seemingly dark and foreboding start into a light and warmth. With statement and answer interplay between the voice and strings parts. 2. \"POEMAS DE AMOR\", a kind of neo-romantic tango which has the fastest tempo. This song contains lovingly blended string writing and an open airy breathable style, both intense and placid at once. A gentle song buoyed by its accompaniment, 3. \"CAPRICHO\" is a milonga with a moderate pace. It's perhaps the most undemanding of the cycle for the listener with a simple happy feel and lilting tempo. 4. \"VIDA\" tends toward a slightly brisker tempo with a more percussive style texture. An open easy-going song. 5. \"T�, QUE NUNCA SER�S...\" is in 3/4 (Tempo di valse) but often employs rhythmic devices such as hemiola, cross-rhythm and syncopation. Varied within itself, the song opens out in the middle, to give an open charm with a solid rhythmic character. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The phasing of chord sequence and talea, their being different in length, results in an 'elliptical' profile of the sequence that draws focus to a different part of it each time it comes around. As it passes it draws in fragments of its transformed self, as well as other cyclic events, giving a continually renewed range of contrasting colours from the the orchestra, the predominant opposition being, as the title suggests between 'dark' and 'light' timbres: the process of the work in broad terms is a transformation from the one state to the other. The work was inspired by the New Zealand painter Colin McCahon's 'Northland Panels'. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Most of the songs set here were collected in 1864 from Maori prisoners captured during the the land wars in the Waikato area south of Auckland. The couplets are not connected in any way except for the central group, for unaccompanied voice, concerning Pikeri, a character  famous at the time for his escapades evading the police; in this instance, enforced separation during a love affair is charted.  The English translations of these pao are used with the kind permission of  the late Margaret Orbell, and come from her \"Maori Poetry, an introductory anthology (Heinemann, 1978).  'Pao' was commissioned by the Northumberland-based Syrinx Trio, with financial assistance from Northern Arts; the first performance was given by Syrinx in Newcastle in 1981.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Fission' draws its name from the actions and reactions that characterise a lot of its material.  The work was based on the concept of organised chaos �resolving� to a chaotic organization.  Despite the apparently haphazard nature of the first section, it is in fact highly organised, while the last section, calmer and seemingly more ordered is in fact far less organised.  The piano plays an important role providing much off the impetus for the introduction of new ideas and textures, introducing the first real melodic material in the solos of the middle section, and directing the harmony towards the greater resolution of the work�s end.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: What happens to us after we die?  This fundamental question has haunted human imagination for thousands of years.  Many recorded accounts of 'near-death' experiences from all over the world provide evidence that human consiousness remains active in the time immediately following death.  These independent accounts describe similar events: the person (or 'spirit') floating above their dead body, the appearance of a great light, being told to go back, and so on.   In 1959, Gina Baxter-Leipolot underwent an emergency operation, was in a coma for three days, and was not expected to recover.  During this time she had a 'near-death' experience in which she was drifting above a Mediterranean coastline.  She heard music, such as the \"velvet sound of of violins, underbroken by a sound like mandolins\" and \"a humming sound, building up in force like thunder\".  Gina remembered the music after she recovered from the coma and twelve years later she wrote the music down in a basic form, with the help of a retired music examiner, John Chew.  She called the music 'Revelations'.   Having been stirred by Gina's story and other 'near-death' accounts, I decided to base my orchestral piece loosely on 'Revelations'.  Gina's music only appears in the coda of the piece, played on celesta and harp.  It is fragmented and interspersed between large orchestral gestures that depict shafts of light.   Revelations begins with human suffering, symbolised by an anguished chromatic motif on the violins.  This is joined by ascending brass chords counterpointed against descending wind chords, as the 'spirit' floats out of the body.  With the entry of the harp the music becomes ethereal, and the flute plays a sinuous, floating melody. A sinister idea is heard on low clarinets, based on the ascending chords.  Following development of these ideas it is the piccolo's turn to play above the harp, as the 'spirit' floats even higher over the sea (symbolised by a static chord, C-D-E).  The music gathers in intensity and at the stroke of a log drum the strings play a fast and dynamic fugato.  This section is turbulent and spiralling, and uses elements from the slow section: the piccolo theme, the low clarinet idea, acsending and descending chords, and thick 'cluster' chords.  Resolution is only found at the start of the coda, where the strings play the static chord C-D-E, and the brass and winds play joyful versions of earlier motifs.  Gina's music then appears, and the piece is rounded off by a blaze of light.  To quote Gina: \"Don't be afraid of death.\"  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'the dancer leads the procession' was written for Jeffrey Grice while I was living in Caen in 1999, shortly after I had moved to France. I began working on the material for the dancer as long ago as 1989. This initial inspiration, founded on the sounds and structure of the Javanese Gamelan, was linked to a specific event. In 1984, when in Java, I had attended a traditional-style wedding ceremony. At the start, the marriage couple were led into the venue by a dancer accompanied by the gamelan who were already installed there. The couple were young, but the dancer could have been in his fifties; he was obviously a master of his art. The trio moved very slowly passing at one stage directly in front of the Gamelan. The dancer�s style was extremely graceful & refined, with many slowly moving expressive gestures of the arms and hands. When directly in front of the Gamelan the dancer turned toward the musicians for a few seconds, and instantly his style of dance changed into something quite different. Frenetically indulging in all the off-beats, he was grooving along with it. Everybody loved this brief and direct acknowledgment to the musicians, and didn�t hesitate to show their enthusiasm. The dancer then returned to the previous style and carried on with the procession moving away from the Gamelan. I remained fascinated by this particular concept of a multi-levelled music and wanted to reflect the idea in the dancer without emulating specific Gamelan techniques. There seemed to be two elements, one representing the long range cycles marked by the large gongs (the slow graceful dance style), and the other of the bustling upper instruments with the constant hocketing.

The name �Taharoto� is derived from two Maori words and is an approximation of the idea of �Westlake�. Literally it means �beside� (taha) �lake� (roto). The lake is Lake Pupuke on Auckland�s North Shore. A feature of the lake is the swans, and the symbol for Westlake Girls High School is the swan. I was asked to include ideas of the lake covered in mist and the swans taking flight, but also to include music which suggested aspects of the characters of the students at Westlake Girls High School: generous, assertive and energetic! Overall the music has a sense of spaciousness, building to an emphatic climax, and subsiding into silence again at the end. The music includes some �contemporary� playing techniques for the string players, with some more challenging parts for the leading wind players. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Lewis Carroll�s long poem (subtitled �An agony in eight fits�) dates from 1872. The original text is divided into eight �fits�. The story details a strange assortment of characters and their search for the Snark. Included in the quest are the Bellman (who acts as expedition leader, and also as something of a narrator at times), the Baker, the Butcher, the Beaver and several others. Each has a designated task although their actual abilities are often rather inadequate: for instance the Baker can only bake bridecake for which there are no materials at hand, and the Butcher can only kill Beavers. Whether or not they find the Snark is left uncertain at the end. The original version of this work was commissioned by Auckland choir Viva Voce in 1998 and first performed in November of that year with Teddy Tahu Rhodes as the Bellman. Lewis Carroll�s famous poem was much too long to set complete, and conductor John Rosser provided an abridged version. For a performance in 2003 the conductor requested an even more abridged work, and provided a more abridged version of the text. The most significant change was the loss of the entire section �The Banker�s Fate�. Otherwise only a few further stanzas were removed from each of the other sections. Some minor revisions were also made to the music.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Having written a new work (��r nAthair�) for the NUIG Choral Society in Galway Ireland, I was asked by conductor Peter Mannion for something lighter for his men�s voices. He asked for texts appropriate to the concerns of most males: specifically �anything to do with college life: exams, drinking, lectures, girls, clubbing etc�!! For texts I returned once more to the poetry of American Jack Prelutsky. Although best-known for his poetry for young people, he has also written poems for adult readers. His collection of �poems for grown-ups� �There�ll Be a Slight Delay� provided me with the source for the five texts I chose. The first text is a supposed personal ad by someone best described as a �loser� � although an ever optimistic one. The second, very brief, piece relates to certain part of the male anatomy. The third piece�well, the title gives a fair idea of the topic: �They did it in the shower� � the poem then nominates other places �it� had been done. The fourth piece is a complaint about men who wear strong scent. The final piece presents us with the dilemma of being a �millennial guy� � to be �mellow� or �macho�. The poet very kindly updated this last poem especially for this cycle � it was originally published as �A 90�s Type Guy�. My thanks to Jack Prelutsky for giving his permission to me to use these texts for �Male Call�. The cycle is dedicated to conductor Peter Mannion. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work is very much a companion piece to my \"Hurdy Gurdy\" of 1989. Both works are based on pieces of early vocal music. Whereas \"Hurdy Gurdy\" drew on the 13th century Spanish melody \"Como poden per sas culpas\", this piece goes back a century to a 12th century sacred song. The original song \"Promat chorus hodie\" is found in the library of the cloister of St. Martial in Limoges. The music shows strong folk-music influences, giving it a vigorous and rhythmic feel. The harmonic support is a simple drone on an open fifth. The opening of the work presents a free transcription of a recording of the piece, although I have taken some liberties with the music I have allocated to the piano. Following this slower introduction the main melody begins played by both flute and cello, initially in octaves and then in fifths. This presentation of the melody in parallel fifths is the source of most of the harmonic support in the piano. Eventually the music becomes quieter and gives way to a repetitive piano background against which fragments of the main melody are heard. A slightly slower section brings the two melody instruments to the fore, giving the pianist a break from the almost constant quaver movement which is a feature of the first two-thirds of the work. The main melody returns at a faster speed in a brief recapitulation, and the whole work ends energetically. The text of the original begins as follows: Verse:  Promat chorus hodie    o contio   canticum letitie    o contio  Refrain: Psallite o contio   psallat cum tripudio (O people, let us all sing out happily today; Make music together, with instruments and dance.) \"Promat chorus hodie\" was commissioned by Chamber Music New Zealand Inc. for the Still/Mathers/Tennant Trio with funds provided from a legacy from the estate of Nancy Hobson of Hawkes Bay and from the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council.  The first performance took place in Napier on 19 September 1994. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Stapes' (pronounced \"Stay-peas\") is the first piece in a series of three trios ('Stapes', 'Malleus', 'Incus') collectively entitled Middle Ear. The stapes (or stirrup) is the smallest in the chain of three bones that transmit vibrations from the eardrum to the internal ear in the process of transformation of external soundwaves to an emotional or cognitive response within the listener. The composition of 'Stapes' was largely dictated by the idiosyncrasies of the ensemble: the piano, suffering under equal temperament and timbral limitation, and the strings, free in pitch (with glissandi and microtones) and hosting a wide timbral palette. The juxtaposition of these disparate musical entities, with the instruments working together and against each other, forms the basis of this work. The piece is physically and mentally demanding, pushing the players in individual and collective struggles for articulacy. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Because of the limitations of range of the instruments (only the piano has extremes of range), their different tuning systems and the fact that only the clarinet among the wind instruments has possibilities of extended techniques.  This piece explores more \"classical\" ideas than some of my other recent pieces.  The work uses a set of six notes as its basic idea: sounded together they have a restless quality, but the structure of the set provides both diversity and connection between the sound worlds of the piece.  Quintet is in a single movement with several sections. At the outset, a variety of ideas and textures are presented, not unlike moment form, but not using the extremities of classical moment form. A second section, over a piano pedal, initiates an exchange between  the bassoon and other instruments. This leads to a rapid scherzo-like section, with a monodic trio. It is closely followed by a slow movement, based on a close-range melody that is a tribute to Hirini Melbourne, who died during the writing of this section. The oboe cadenza which follows is the structural centre of the quartet, and is followed by a reworking in reverse of the material already presented. The ending leaves the piece unresolved.  Quintet was commissioned by Chamber Music New Zealand, with funding from Creative New Zealand, for the Brisbane- based Southern Cross Soloists, who included it in Chamber Music New Zealand's 2003 Celebrity Season, giving the first performance in Palmerston North on July 10th.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Based on the Noh drama Kocho (\"Butterfly\"), this chamber opera was written as part of my composition folio for my Honours year of study at Victoria University of Wellington.  Although at this particular time I had never heard or seen a Noh drama, I was captivated by this text which I had found in the university library, and decided to make my own setting.   This particular drama belongs to the genre of \"Spirit Pieces\" where the chief motivation is the desire for Nirvana promised by Buddha.  In Kocho, the spirit of the butterfly is denied the bliss of Nirvana for a specific reason- her desire for the companionship of the plum blossom that blooms before her time.  She tells her story to a travelling monk, asking him to pray for her.  In the second act, the butterfly dances joyfully amongst the plum blossoms, her wish fulfilled at last.  The musical language I have used is a mixture of freely written tonal passages with strong doses of modal (often rather Asian sounding, although not based on any particular system) and minor harmonies, as well as minimalist elements.  The choir sings mainly in unison, and in contrast to a traditional Noh choir is made up entirely of women's voices.  On occasion the pianist takes on a more soloistic role, as does the leader of the orchestra.    Presented in an unstaged performance at Victoria University of Wellington, in November 1991.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Puhake ki te rangi', which translates as 'spouting to the skies' is a celebration of whales, and was written late in 2006 for the New Zealand String Quartet and Richard Nunns as a project undertaken while I was the CNZ/NZSM composer-in-residence, living in the Lilburn House in Wellington.  Although one section is based on a transcription of whale song, there is no programme to the piece - no confrontation with humanity, for instance. The guiding principles were the extreme range of whale song, the changing patterns of their song, and the image, given to me by the late Tungia Baker, of a whale in Campbell Island waters allowing seal pups at play to slide down her flanks over and over again until, tiring of the game, she flipped them gently away.  The taonga puoro (Maori instruments) used in this piece are all made from whale bone or the bone from the albatross, the whale's avian  counterpart.  In the order they are played, the taonga are, the percussive tumutumu, made from the jaw of a pilot whale washed up on Farewell Spit, a karanga manu (bird caller) made from an orca tooth, two nguru (flutes) made from the teeth of sperm whales that stranded one in Tory channel and one at Paekakariki, two putorino koiwi toroa (instruments made here from albatross bones, which have two different voices, being played as flute or trumpet), made here from the wingbones of a wandering albatross from the sub-Antarctic islands and a young royal albatross from the Chatham Islands, a nguru made from the cochlea of a hump-backed whale and finally a putorino koiwi toroa, especially made for this piece from the rib of a right whale that beached at Cable Bay.  Members of the Quartet play percussive instruments - whalebone tumutumu and tokere (castanets). All these instruments were made by Brian Flintoff.  In the score, the taonga puoro sections are improvised; mostly the quartet parts are notated, but sometimes the players are required to improvise.   Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This set of music represents the culmination of a project instigated in 2000 by the Anglican cathedral in Auckland. The intention was to provide a set of music which could be performed by large forces (choir with brass sextet and organ) or simply in unison by a congregation with piano accompaniment. The original commission from Holy Trinity Cathedral was instigated by the then Director of Music Peter Watts, and was described as �a gift to the people of New Zealand from Holy Trinity Cathedral�. The project description further stated: \"The New Zealand Prayer Book contains many liturgies which we adapt in various ways to suit music composed over the past 400 years � mostly English composers with a few New Zealanders represented � Mews, Griffiths, Dienes and Jennings. We would like to invite leading New Zealand composer, David Hamilton, in consultation with the Director of Music, to write a set of music specifically for the new liturgies, that could be sung either simply by the congregation with organ or piano accompaniment, or in a more complex style by church and cathedral choirs combining with the congregation.\" The first set of music was performed on Easter Sunday 2000 in the morning service at Holy Trinity Cathedral. This second set of pieces, completed in mid-2002, consists of texts selected from alternative services within the New Zealand Prayer Book. The music is scored for brass (3 trumpets and 3 trombones) and organ, but also performable with just piano or organ accompaniment. The vocal parts are designed to be performable just by congregation, or incorporating a choir. This millennium project was funded by the NZ Lottery Grants Board. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The Flourish aims to capture the lady's attention; through the Romance, Dance, and Aria the suitor presses his cause, and in the Finale the couple celebrate a successful outcome.  I wouldn't, however, suggest that this story line be taken too literally! The music, I hope, speaks for itself. The Aria gives the double-bass a chance to shine as a soloist, and the Finale refers back to earlier material, then skips for joy, and finally relaxes into a tranquil �apotheosis�.  This Serenade was commissioned by Denis and Verna Adam to celebrate their fortieth wedding anniversary. The first performance was given by the NZ Chamber Orchestra in September 1993.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: These four songs follow on from the set �Just Desserts� written for young singers. Whereas that set used poems drawn from a set of readers for primary school students, the poems in this set are from diverse sources. They also present a slightly more jaundiced or darker view of eating and food albeit in a humorous way. The poems were written for young people, and the songs have been aimed at the same age group. The vocal ranges cover about an octave, avoiding extremes of high and low singing. The songs could also be sung as unison choral pieces. The first song �O Sliver of Liver� is a heartfelt plea for a dreaded food to go away. �Battle-hymn of the Ice-cream Connoisseur� is a short poem about the lengths one goes to in order to enjoy a favourite food. The third song, �I Ate Too Much�, details the number of foods that have been stuffed in, but just maybe there�s room for something extra after the main course! The final song, �Garbage Delight�, never actually tells us just what the food of the title is, but it�s obviously something special � better than jelly, ice-cream, candy or even Toffee Surprise. The poems are by  Myra Cohn Livingston (�O Sliver of Liver�), Adrian Mitchell (�Battle-hymn of the Ice-cream Connoisseur�), Jack Prelutsky (�I Ate Too Much�), and Dennis Lee (�Garbage Delight�).

Broughton, the older brother of one of her childhood friends. She was drawn to the poem because it expressed the disillusionment with religion she herself was experiencing at the time. Being a student work, 'Epithalamia' has been somewhat neglected by performers, and has only recently been �rediscovered�. Its recording here attests to the youthful composer�s impressive self-confidence, both in the expressive use of the voice and in the effective piano writing. (Programme note: Mark Jones).

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Violaceous' is an escape from tonality to the land of surrealism: a beautiful place of aural obscurity where serial and tonal elements are combined. The piece is predominantly serial, in four sections. The first section has two contrasting characters, the first is light and carefree while the second is reflective and emotional. They introduce two important motives. The first motive appears in the first six notes, it is a gesture that appears throughout the work in various disguises. The second is the minor second interval that dominates the latter part of the work. The second section is quirky and fun. It develops the grace notes and flourishes of the opening. The third section has the reflective character from the opening section. It gradually increases in tension until it reaches the fourth section, where the piece ends with the unleashing of a wild dance that frees itself by abandoning its rigid serial structure.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'farewell' attempts to integrate a number of diverse musical influences ranging from traditional Maori through nineteenth century European to modern American jazz and South American tango. The body of the piece is melodic and harmonious, but is framed by abstract episodes. To achieve these abstract sounds, the cello plays microtones and a few varieties of distortion effects, some sounding as birds. The piano is �prepared� by inserting a small piece of foam rubber under the lowest octave of strings and also by having the player strum directly on the strings with either a piece of felt or a rubber piano tuner�s mute.  As the title suggests, farewell  includes elements of nostalgia, mystery, and pathos. The feelings one may have on saying good-bye to the present and viewing the future with a bit of apprehension.  A time for re-evaluation.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Since 1994 I have had an on-going association with the city of Galway in Ireland. Initially this was through the Cois Cladaigh Chamber Choir which presented a concert of works of mine in that year, and has subsequently performed and recorded other pieces. Another choir in the city that has included my music in their repertoire was the NUIG Choral Society under the direction of Peter Mannion. This university choir had sung my �Nunc Dimittis� at a competition in 2005 and the conductor was keen to have something new for their next year�s repertoire. He asked if I might consider a new setting of the Lord�s Prayer (�Our Father who art in heaven...�), but setting the text in Irish. The opening section, marked �serenely, with great spaciousness�, establishes the tonic key of D major securely. The music unfolds from an initial unison D, through simple tonal chords set against an on-going D in the 1st altos. The remainder of the work is largely chordal, using relatively simple tonal chords centred on the key of D major. The scoring is for unaccompanied SSAATB voices. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The text was collected by Sir Apirana Ngata in his book 'Nga Moteatea' of 1959. It is written in a dialect differing in several aspects from present day Maori. There is no record of the original chant; however this setting utilises some of the devices and conventions from that tradition.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

In the first two years it received 36 performances worldwide and was recorded by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra with Harley as soloist. Performed frequently internationally, several other recordings have been made of this work.  Rhapsody combines the sensitivity, expressive and distinct tone colours of the accordion with the full power of a symphony orchestra.  This performance was recorded live in concert, 13 October 2005, in Olomouc, Czech Republic, with the composer conducting the Moravian Philharmonic Orchestra. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: As its title suggests, this piece is about a constant wavering in purpose and intention, where ideas vie for a foothold in an ever shifting aural vista. Crudity wrestles with elegance, liquid horizontalism explodes out of and is then impeded by block verticalism, grand string-centred explorations are effaced and undermined by lightly scored, fragmentary material, seemingly stable colour palates are suddenly infiltrated by waves or blobs of contrasting timbres...  I was very interested in exploring in some small way the huge array of sub-groupings of instruments within the orchestra, and I sought to elevate these chamber groupings to the same level of importance as the entire body of resources used simultaneously. The most obvious example of this is the frequent use of the string quartet (ie, the lead players of each string section, minus the basses) as both a timbral paring-back of the strings as a whole and a sovereign expressive force in its own right. In considering the orchestra in part as a large chamber group, many individual lines assume, in isolated areas, concerto-like duties and characteristics, where their solo outbursts are supported by burbling, decorational accompaniments. Only towards the end does a single rhythmic idea (a simple driving moto perpetuo) sustain a platform around which previously antagonistic colouristic and textural devices are able to mingle happily before a final decay of order and a brief, evaporating coda. �Vacillations� was premiered in Perth by the West Australian Symphony Orchestra, conductor Kevin Field, as part of the Australian Composers' Orchestral Forum, 2002.

The musical materials existed first as independent objects, which were then manipulated to draw out links between them. I was particularly interested in areas in which the acoustical systems of the instrument become unstable, where a precisely specified physical gesture will produce an unpredictable sonic result. Many of the sounds hover around the threshold of audibility, and the performer is constantly involved in a delicate balancing act. 'Sinew/Synapse' is dedicated to the cellist Robert Ibell, whose role in the music�s evolution was invaluable. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This piece is essentially an extended fanfare. It opens with a single note gradually fanning out to a chord in the brass, and this idea returns at the climax of the piece. This material gives way to the first main melodic idea in the strings, against which the woodwind provide a repetitive and lively accompaniment. The middle section is softer and allows several of the woodwind instruments to take short solos against sustained string chords. A build up of energy leads back to the original brass idea, but this time set against insistent pitch in the woodwind and strings. The piece ends firmly in the tonic key of D major. �Piece in Celebration: Puke Ariki� was written for, and won first prize in, a competition organised by the New Plymouth Orchestra to mark the opening of the city�s new museum and library complex �Puke Ariki�.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: TS Eliot�s poem suite 'The Hollow Men' has long since gripped me in both an aesthetic and an expressive sense.  For some time I toyed with the idea of writing a piece that responded in some way to the poem.  In fact, 'Our dried voices' didn�t begin life as that piece, but during the planning process I quickly realised that the suite of poems might provide both a starting point for my sonic ideas for the piece, and a reference for the political and social ideas I was struggling to express in an essentially abstract art.  Eliot�s references to dryness and deadness (�our dried voices, when/We whisper together/Are quiet and meaningless/As wind in dry grass�) provided ideas for a strong sonic world in which to work, while the last two lines of paradox  (�Shape without form, shade without colour/Paralysed force, gesture without motion�) offered a structural and gestural concept with which to battle musically; the work is set up around gestures that dissipate into clouds of sound, act against, and bury each other, and eventually become so intermingled that they lose any individual potency and  are important only as part of the general barrage of voices.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work is a re-scoring of three movements from my work for choir and brass band �The Dragons are Singing Tonight�. That work sets poems by Jack Prelutsky, an American poet, whose poetry for children is highly regarded and widely anthologised. One of the movements, the 2nd of this set, was already just for brass band, and I added two other movements to make a short suite. Essentially the original choral parts have been absorbed into the band texture. Although several possibilities exist for a collective noun for dragons, apparently a �flight� is the most widely used word. �The Mechanical Dragon� is made up of all sorts of bits and pieces which might be found around the house, from rusty shovels to unmendable socks. The poem also describes some of the noises it makes. �Boom! the thunder dragon� is a description of the dragon who claims �I am Boom the thunder dragon, taller than the tallest trees, I stir mighty whirlwinds when I whisper, mighty cyclones when I sneeze...�. The poem for the final movement suggests that while dragons were once believed in, their time is now over and they�ve lived their last. Or have they? �The Dragons are Singing Tonight� was commissioned by Auckland Choral Society (conductor: Peter Watts) with funding provided by Creative New Zealand. The texts from �The Dragons are Singing Tonight� were used by kind permission of the poet and Greenwillow Books, New York. �The Dragons are Singing Tonight� was first performed on 29 June 1996 by Auckland Choral Society and Fosters Auckland Brass, conducted by Peter Watts. It has since been widely performed in New Zealand and also in Canada and England. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: During my stay in Toronto, for a brief time I was able to make use of the piano in a local church in return for singing with the choir on Sundays- as they were, at that stage, short of members with good music reading skills.  Although a short-lived arrangement, it was long enough for the contents of the hymnal in the chapel to inspire this Trio on Hymn Tunes.  The piece is in four freely composed movements; each is based on one or more hymn tunes � the basis for my investigations being sometimes the melodic aspect of the hymn, and sometimes the harmonic one. Composed for Enamble 3 of Mexico City.  Dedicated to my mother Alison Carey, from whom I have had the experience of hearing and singing hymns such as these from an early age.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In 1981 I composed a series of piano pieces called 'Poems of Spring', in which I juxtaposed the exhilarating beauty of a Christchurch spring with the terrible pain of a broken relationship. Ten years later, and in the middle of a cruel Dunedin winter, I recalled this Christchurch spring as I was composing this short piece for the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra. 1991 was a year in which I managed to climb out of a dark phase in my life, and consequently this piece expresses a sense of excitement and affirmation. Lasting  just under 3 minutes, it was designed as a fanfare to open a concert and combines several short motifs into a busy mosaic of sound. 'Yet Another Poem of Spring' is recorded by the NZSO on their 'Landscapes' CD, released by Morrison Music Trust (MMT2037) in 2001.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Ten Bells for Turning Forty' was written as a fortieth birthday present for Andrew Sparling, whose playing I have enjoyed and admired since I first heard him perform at Huddersfield in 1992. The 'Ten Bells' of the title, represented in a crassly literal-minded way in the performance, is a pub on the corner of Commercial Street and Fournier Street, where Andrew's birthday gathering was to have taken place. The clarinet music consists of ten gestures which are chosen by the player from a repository of twenty-two variants of seven basic types (\"tropes\") given in the score, according to a strict set of rules. The percussionist has ten fixed tropes, the first six consisting of a single bell strike. The piece is conceived as a sort of enigmatic game or ritual, with the players obeying arcane rules.

In this piece, the 'dreamer' is the earth itself, recalling an episode in its own history. Emerging from the primordia of a barely audible heartbeat, to which it ultimately returns, the work draws on the full resources of the symphony orchestra to build organically from delicate stirrings to a physicality of volcanic intensity. 'The Third Dream' has been recorded by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra for Radio NZ.   Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Four Echoes' for solo 'cello had been taking shape slowly when news came of Douglas Lilburn's death. For me this had many personal  associations; the first New Zealand music I heard was by Douglas Lilburn, and through years at Victoria University and after I came to  know him as teacher and supportive professional colleague. His music has always held a special power for me, and as I wrote musical shadows  appeared in the work, particularly in the Lament which is specifically in his memory.  There is a further personal association; apart from the fact that the 'cello has always been one of my favourite instruments, Robert Ibell plays on  an instrument made by my brother, who also played 'cello in the Kiwi Pacific recording of Douglas's String Quartet. One of my aims in  composing the work was to make as much use as possible of the natural resonances of the instrument, so I hope this is an adequate tribute both to  the instrument and to the composer whose shadow hovers over us all.

The accompanying instrumentation varies for each song; the vocal line is often rather angular, but this is softened by the freely triadic harmonies of the accompanying figures, which lend each song its particular mood.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Poems of a Bright Moon' for flute/alto flute, clarinet and piano was inspired by the Hsiang-Yang Songs of Li Po, an 8th-century Chinese poet of the T'ang Dynasty (ca.618-906 A.D.).  On a visit to New Mexico in the United States, the discovery of the poet William Carlos Williams and the art work of Georgia O'Keeffe led to the poetry of Li Po, which conjures up visions of mountains and rivers, also very much part of the New Mexico landscape.  Li Po was something of a mischievous travelling minstrel and liked to indulge in the drink somewhat.  A legend says that �while out drunk in a boat, he fell into a river and drowned trying to embrace the moon.�   The moon appears in over a third of his poems, and the opportunity to combine Li Po's images of moonlight with the rich dark tones of the alto flute was irresistible.  The individual titles of the movements of this piece come directly from the poems, and the music attempts to evoke the spirit of the titles: �Hsien mountain rises above emerald Han river,� �On a moonlit night, a recluse plays his pale white ch'in� and �A pure ten-thousand-mile wind arrives.�  'Poems of a Bright Moon' was commissioned by Ethos trio with funding assistance from Creative New Zealand.

After a slow introduction, a rhythmic melody springs to life, leading to a rumbustious second theme. This work is scored for a full orchestra, and is designed for good high school players and tertiary students.  It lasts 9 minutes. It was commissioned by the Christchurch Youth Orchestra.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The title � \"Equals\" � expresses the idea of sharing between two similar instruments. This happens in a variety of ways in the eight duos, but I was particularly interested in exploring the interweaving and crossing of the two violin bines and the idea of dividing ideas between them. I have always been drawn to the idea of duos, whether for equal or unequal instruments � clarinets or keyboard. But the warmth and expressiveness of stringed instruments has a special appeal, which I hope comes across in this set. They also exist in a version for two cellos.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This carol was intended to capture something of the Christmas festival as it is experienced by most New Zealanders.  The first verse sets the scene in the beaches which begin to attract more and more people as the school holidays end and the warm weather arrives. The second verse describes something of the hectic shopping spree that precedes the giving of Christmas presents. The last verse relates the festival to its origins in the birth of Jesus. In a land of many trees and forests, an important feature of the celebration of Christmas has been the provision and decoration of the Christmas tree. The Pohutukawa tree flowers in December, and is sometimes referred to as \"the Christmas tree\". The last verse of the carol includes a reference to the tree that must have yielded its boughs for the cross on which the Christmas child was ultimately to perish. There are several versions of the carol; CA30 for SATB and organ, through-composed. CA30a for easy SATB (all verses to the same music) with optional organ/piano/guitar. CA30b for unison voices with simple piano or guitar accompaniment. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

For me this had many personal associations; the first New Zealand music I heard was by Douglas Lilburn, and through years at Victoria University and after I came to know him as teacher and supportive professional colleague. His music has always held a special power for me, and as I wrote musical shadows appeared in the work, particularly in the Lament which is specifically in his memory.   Early in 2007 NZSO violist Peter Barber approached me about the possibility of performing the work on viola, and I was delighted to consider this and review the work for this purpose.

Leonard Cohen's song lodged itself in my brain at an undetermined point somewhere between that first release and the present. The moment that stuck in my mind most clearly was when the back-up singers wiggled their way upwards in the chorus on \"Marianne\" (a moment which fails to reappear in my own version of the song). Now Marianne's name has gone, and I hope I have found a way to make the song new. I don't remember ever hearing the words to the verse I've set, but I can imagine Trisha on a window ledge, miles above the traffic, stuttering a song of goodbye. So long.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work is a setting of a short poem by the Spanish poet Miguel de Unamuno (1864-1936). It begins by setting the text in a fragmentary manner, choosing single key words from the poem: canta (singing), luna (moon), sosegada (lulling), blanca (white), and sola (alone). Throughout, I have sought to evoke a mood of stillness and calm (except at the two main climaxes), and much of the writing consists of simple diatonic chords alternating between the two choirs. The work ends, as it began, alternating the words 'canta' and 'luna'. The unusual scoring came about through my friendship with a fine horn player and singer - a flippant comment about unorthodox combinations of forces (although I have heard one other work for horn and choir) providing the germ of idea which eventually did bear fruit. �The Moon is Silently Singing� is one of my most widely preformed works internationally, having been heard in Australia, Canada, Germany, England and the USA. It is scheduled for publication by Walton Music in 2004. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

I have always admired the wry humour and brightness of Kevin Ireland's writing and many years ago set three of his poems for soprano and mixed ensemble.  As a kind gesture Mr Ireland sent me a copy of his book of poems �Skinning A Fish�, and I was particularly struck by the imagery of colours, flowers, feathers and birds in this poem, which illustrates rain pouring down a window pane and giving way to a burst of sunshine after a storm.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Section 1 - Bars 1 to 25  The haunting opening theme gives a sense of imbalance and cross rhythm. This, combined with polytonality and energetic counterpoint typifies the wide scope of disparate expression contained in this work.  The simple opening figures gain momentum and complexity in bar 2, then slow and slower until the robust introduction of the first of the round themes at bar 4. Varying degrees of counterpoint are juxtaposed in the succeeding phrases, along with the exploitation of three distinct themes in alternating patterns of rounds. The momentum is then diffused, winding down with trills and running semi-demi-quavers into the low bass of the piano alongside ponticello effects in the strings.  Unexpected harmonies and intense flourishes are balanced across the timbre of the ensemble. Ultimately runs of harmonic glissandi mark the end of the opening section. The ending purposely engenders a sense of perplexity, of not knowing what next to expect.  Section 2 - Bars 26 to 67 'Misterioso'  Bars 26-40 mark the first sub-section, followed by the second, bars 41 to 53 and the third, bar 54 to 67. Various devices, such as sequences and pauses are implemented to cause the momentum to surge and ebb. The different melodies and underlying contrapuntal fragments are in constant interplay throughout each sub-section. Each individual sub-section has a differing tone and timbre as different ideas come forth and are contemplated.  The third section comprises a great fugue which is a quadruple rhythmic elongation of the primary theme from section three('Calypso') that follows. This is treated in four parts contrapuntally, one of which is retrograde to the others. The rhythm gains momentum toward the end of the fugue to propel you into the third section.  Section 3 - Bars 68 to 158 'Calypso'  This lively, quick-paced, rambunctious section is hallmarked by virtuosic writing for all the instruments. Though not exactly in the style of a true Caribbean �calypso�, the repeated syncopation pattern in the piano gave rise to this title. Elaborate contrapuntal juxtapositions of past themes, with differing harmonies, clash and bounce off each other in a frenzy. The momentum is fuelled by the compelling refrain which first occurs at bar 94 and repeatedly in a chorus at the conclusion of the finale. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The night sky's debris to which the work claims to pay homage has been forgotten by the composer, perhaps signalling the piece was always more significant than the occasion which nominally gave rise to it. Given one cannot literally write down the night sky (or its debris), any more than one can pull it down, it is unsurprising that a juxtapositional collection of motifs captured on manuscript paper should outlive any given evening. The piece, with its calls, upward arcs and gentle falls, may loosely suggest some kind of homage to an unreachable sky, but this relationship is a rebus better left to sing for itself.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Down in the Brunner Mine was commissioned by The Onslow Brass Band in Wellington and first performed and broadcast in 1996.  It is a short set of variations based on a New Zealand folk song called 'Down in the Brunner Mine'.  The folk song describes the coal mine on the West Coast, near Greymouth, and tells of the disaster that occured there in the 1890s when about 60 men were killed in a mine collapse.  Here is the first stanza:   We worked in the heat and the thick black dust,  Sticks to your skin like a burnt pie crust,  We rue each day the miner must  Go down in the Brunner Mine.   The folksong tune is announced by the cornets at the beginning, playing in their low register, accompanied by heavy chords in the low brass.  Variation 1 features a horn solo, and the cornets return for Variation 2, playing in fourths.  Variations 3 and 4 are strident in character and feature short flourishes.  The snare drum enters at the start of Variation 5 and the cornets play a punchy idea using repeated notes.   This idea returns in contrapuntal form in Variation 7, while the 6th variation inbetween features little fragments of the theme on various instruments.  Variation 8 is powerful and buffeting, and uses the theme in canon.  Variations 9-11 make use of the theme's arpeggio outline and the music builds to a climax.   Following this, the music gradually winds down in Variation 12, with the theme appearing in inversion against a repeated bass pattern. After a reflective silence, the short chorale-like coda rounds off the work, and is marked \"in memoriam\".  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

I decided to follow this concert theme and largely based this Elegy on material from Music to Boil an Egg By.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Though notated as Western music, 'The Fire Raga' is written in the style of Indian classical music. It abounds in figurations common to that style. In Indian classical music the musicians improvise on the scale notes of a chosen 'raga' (a mode in Western music), and, therefore, the music is not notated. When there are two instrumentalists, say sitar and shahnai (a one-reed wind instrument) they mainly 'dialogue' with each other, imitating a phrase introduced by one player and repeated from memory by the other, joining together in the occasional unison. In 'The Fire Raga' the imitation often involves three, or, at times, all four players, and unison passages are often harmonized, but, at all times only the scale notes of the 'raga' are sounded. Glissandi, grace notes and trills decorate the notes. The tuning of the scale notes in Indian classical music, which is subtly different to that of traditional Western music, achieves the mood and atmosphere which is the intention of the 'raga'. The time of day when a particular 'raga' is played is important too. For instance, 'The Fire Raga' is meant to be played at 'sunset when the lamps are lighted at the end of twilight.' This 'raga' of Northern Indian music called 'The Fire Raga' belongs to a group of evening ragas known as Dipaka (after sunset). It is hexatonic but different in ascent and descent consisting of C, E, F sharp, G, A flat, B (ascending) and C, A flat, G, F sharp, E, D flat (descending). Notice there is no D flat in the ascending scale and no B in the descending. The notes of the raga are introduced in the slow beginning section establishing their relationship with the 'tonic�(consonant) C and the 'dominant' (sonant) G.  When the tabla enters in the longer fast section of the music the player uses a rhythmic pattern called a tala. Certain standard variations fill out the pattern as well as some cross-rhythms. The player diverts from the basic pattern to add interest and a sense of 'play' with the other musicians. In the first performance of this piece a tabla player was unavailable so the improvised drum part was played on a 'djembe' - a single-headed drum from West Africa - successfully enhancing the music.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: These pieces were written in response to John Rimmer�s lectures on the chromatic system, and new ways of navigating it.  One influence was the �tone clock� theory of Peter Schat.   The first movement is based on an octatonic scale that I devised, and the second movement utilises a chord sequence that  progresses from consonance to dissonance and back again, with the harmonies blurring slightly as the chords merge from one to  the other, rather than jumping from chord to chord in a detached manner.   The third movement has passacaglia-type qualities, combining melodies, counter-melodies, inversions, augmentations and  diminutions. It uses the same scale as the first movement.  These pieces were premiered in 1999 by Auckland pianist Michael Bell, with whom I was awarded that year�s Llewellyn  Jones Prize in music for piano at Auckland University.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 1. The first movement illustrates the plethora of fish to be seen at the Aquarium at feeding time. There are small fish, big fish, colourful fish and plain fish. I have tried to mimic the darting movements of the small fish with quick high grace notes and tremolos. In contrast, the darker notes of the oboe and the piano represent the bigger, slower and brooding fish.  2. Watching the harbour in the morning is one of the most serene and beautiful experiences one can have in Barcelona. One morning I visited the harbour when the skies were clear and the sun was sparking on the ocean, which was a most brilliant blue. The area was almost deserted; it was early. I have captured the tranquillity of the moment with an intimate trio of cello, violin and clarinet.  3. Finding large as life puppets in the square outside the Cathedral was a delight. I imagined them to be alive, moving jerkily, interacting and dancing a little in an empty space.   4. Stepping out of the Metro and being confronted by La Sagrada Familia was a momentous experience. I have chosen two aspects of what I felt for this movement. Firstly, there is the foreboding nature of the building; the way it looks as though it were melting, twisting and almost lurching as it towers over you. Secondly, there is the light and peace that radiates from it through the optimistic spires and delicate bird decorations.   5. The fun side of Gaudi can be seen in the fairytale-like Park G�ell, which is full of excitement, laughter and maybe (if you�re lucky) at bit of dancing. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This piece endeavours to evoke the imagery of e.e.cummings' poem, which itself has a musical structure, and creates a striking sound-image: 'children forever singing, wreathed with singing, etc.' which is contrasted with a profound concept of silence: 'silence of stone'. Unlike the way one might approach other texts, there was no call for adding to the repetitions and fragmentation already within the poem; instead I see the composition of the musical setting as creating a field of resonance around the poem and a kind of 'surface' for its presentation, while leaving its structure intact. The experience it embodies is very much like tuning in to the atmosphere of a particular, very still place and the images evoked there, living through a memory or fantasy which floods the senses, then fades.

I was pleased to have a new performance possibility and set to work straight away using the �Gaol Bird� (see above) as a starting point. At much the same time I heard a new work by Rudolf Kelterborn in which longish movements were separated be short and often sparsely orchestrated fragments. What stayed with me in the end were these fragments and so came the idea for this suite. Apart from the song like second movement (�Goal Bird�) and the clock like 3rd  movement the pieces are abstract but try to use typical trombone sounds with glissandi, big dynamic changes and wahwah mutes.  I sent the score and parts off to Kari L. in March 2004, he thanked me and promised I would hear more soon. A year went by. I wrote him an email. He said he was trying to arrange a performance for April or May.  As I write it�s now 17. May and so far not a word � although I specially asked to be able to hear an earlyish rehearsal, it�s important to me that I have time to make any improvements that may be necessary.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This Mass was composed as a tribute to the millennium. The form of the Mass has had a profound influence on the development of western music. Subtly buried in its constructions are reflections of the sounds of every century of the past millennium, from the plainsong monody and early organum of one thousand years ago, through the sounds of the 'ars antiqua', the evolution of the music of the renaissance, the baroque, the classical and the romantic periods, to the sounds of the 20th century (including a tone row, blues, percussive rhythms and so forth). The plaintive, yearning harmonies of the opening Kyrie, contrasts with the joyful sounds of the Gloria and Sanctus. The Credo is a coat of many colours and the final Agnus Dei, composed in the Ionian mode, contains no accidentals - it answers Shoenberg's observation that \"there is still plenty of good music to be written in the key of C\".

I have tried to incorporate his idea of creating a polyphonic type of listening through the use of contrasting motifs, textures and tempi. The title for the work came during the writing process and led the piece to be slightly programmatic.   According to Maori legend, Pania is a sea-goddess who ventured onto land only at night. There she met a man who later became her husband and together the couple bore a son. Wishing his family wouldn�t return to the sea with every sunrise, the husband cast a spell on the pair. The spell however, had the opposite effect. Pania and the boy returned to the sea forever where she became a reef, lying with her arms outstretched towards her husband.

A.S.Thomson wrote about the poem: \"The Hawaiki fleet reached New Zealand when the pohutukaua (sic) and rata trees were covered with blossoms.  It was consequently summer, and the emigrants, like the survivors of a wreck, scattered themselves over the country.  To appease the spirit of the land for their intrusion humiliating prayers were said; one uttered by a chief on this celebrated occasion is still preserved as a modern charm\":   I arrive where an unknown earth is under my feet,  I arrive where a new sky is above me,  I arrive at this land  A resting place for me.  O spirit of the earth! the stranger humbly offers his heart  As food for thee.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This short concerto was written for the Taharoto Orchestra, a group consisting of students from Westlake Girls and Westlake Boys High Schools conducted by Liz Cable. It was the second work I had written for the group. The concerto is cast in the traditional three movement form: fast-slow-fast. Although there is no cadenza as such, the first movement does contain a short solo section where a cadenza might have appeared. The first movement is rather like an extended fanfare, making much use of the chords of F major and G major. Sometimes these two chords sound simultaneously, sometimes they are heard successively. The music opens featuring the percussion and low strings playing �pizzicato�, setting in motion the underlying rhythmic energy that pervades the whole movement. The second movement is a short, slow and serious movement., It uses a single theme which is divided into two sections, the first section in A minor, and the second section beginning in C major. This theme is heard three times � the final time allowing the piano to present a varied treatment of the opening section, while the second part of the theme is presented as a canon. The final movement, marked �playfully�, uses a mix of 4 beats and 5 beats in a bar. The music appears to have a slightly �French neo-classical� feel to it, using short phrases and simple succinct melodic ideas. The whole work ends with an affirmative cadence in C major.

While the main impetus of the work centres around a musical argument, there is also a  loose correlation between the musical material, and the intense, oppressive and consistent  heat of the La Nina weather patterns as it affected the east coast of the South Island.  I would like to thank Judith Clark (whose request for a small piano work that might be  suitable for her piano students at the School of Music, University of Canterbury initiated  El Nino) for her unwavering support of New Zealand Music.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Commissioned for the opening of the new National Library building in 1987, this work was the centre piece in a concert of New Zealand music which inaugurated the Library�s auditorium. Harris chose Alistair Campbell�s poetry as he has always enjoyed its vernacular quality. Included in the ensemble are some of Harris� favourite instruments: soprano saxophone, bass clarinet and flugelhorn. Harris views this work almost as a kind of unstaged melodrama. As with his 'To the Memory of I.S. Totska' (2000), 'Dreams Yellow Lions' was written in a period between work on his operas and acts as a substitute for the larger compositional form. Short instrumental interludes link the songs through various emotional states. �It�s all about memories and I always imagine an old man thinking about his younger days, dreaming away, getting old and becoming sick�.

My selection of poems retained this organisation, although during composition of the cycle I substituted my original choice for the final poem with Robin Hyde�s �Road�s End�. The poets represented in the cycle are A.R.D. Fairburn, Mary Stanley, Brian Turner, Denis Glover and Robin Hyde. There is no real common thread which links the poems, other than their subject of love. All except the first speak directly to another person, whereas the first is descriptive of a loved one. The second poem speaks of the intimacy of love. It provides the cycle�s title in its last two lines: �I seek no other heav�n beyond your mortal face�. The third poem has the poet offering to give the reasons why love has flourished: to �...invite me to speak of the secrets I never knew I wanted to tell you�. The fourth poem uses the recurring line �I am bright with the wonder of you� to describe the various attractions of the loved one. The final song is a re-working of a piece which originally appeared as part of my �Three Robin Hyde Impressions� of 1993 for choir and piano. It seemed to fit here as a bittersweet farewell to love : �you have made summer golden, now you go�. �No Other Heaven� was commissioned by New Zealand guitarist Tony Donaldson with funding from Creative New Zealand whose assistance is gratefully acknowledged.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Near the start of play, a reference is made to the strings that the audience can hear, and Tennessee Williams is quite specific in where he wants music to be placed. The director of the production, Jesse Peach, and I decided that a solo violin would be the appropriate medium for the music for his Glass Menagerie. The music is dominated by one particular theme, which is found in the Prelude. This theme symbolises the unfulfilled or unfulfillable dreams of the cast, and the resignation and quiet desperation that goes hand in hand with these. Other music is present: a theme to represent Amanda, the mother, whose recollections of a more �gentile� time motivate many of her decisions; music from the dance hall and a waltz off the gramophone; and these themes are frequently interwoven. For practical purposes, numbers are often written longer than needed (eg. the waltz) as their endings need to coincide with stage action, sometimes abruptly. The forms are generally very simple, and I have felt that simple forms and material were best in combination with the drama. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Hinetekakara is the ancestress of Aroha Yates-Smith, the kaikaranga (singer) who provided the idea and the text of this piece. Hinetekakara lived on the shores of Lake Rotorua with Ihenga, her husband or father, an eponymous ancestor of the Te Arawa people, when the land was still being settled after the arrival of the Te Arawa canoe from central Polynesia.   The four cadenzas, for bassoon, alto flute, flute, cello and bassoon, and bassoon link improvised sections, in which all the instruments participate. The singer initially invokes, accompanied by putatara (conch shell trumpet), the spirit of Hinetekakara, then addresses rituals following the death of her future father-in-law (with putorino), and then the birth of her son (with pumotomoto, an instrument used to assist at child-birth). A voiceless improvisation on pupu harakeke (flax snail), an instrument presaging danger, is followed by Ihenga's anguished lament as he finds the murdered body of Hinetekakara by the lake, by the place named for her, Ohinemutu, meaning the end of the woman. Finally, she is farewelled as her spirit returns to the afterworld.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: While no 'Lyric Suite', this is my most ambitious composition to date, combining multiple musical cultures dating over the past 1,000 years.  The first movement owes something to the world of Janacek, and is even based upon a Czech folk tune (which one hears partially disguised at one point).   The second (no jokes about \"La Quesadilla,\" please), is based upon music I have heard played by South Mexican street bands.  A simple melody becomes more fragmented until it distorts into this nightmarish scherzo. 'Talencourt' starts with direct transcription of a Quebecois folk melody as originally played in the 1920s by \"Villeneuve and Bouchard\" a violin and accordion duo - later released on the 1985 album, 'You Can Tell the World About This' (Morning Star Records).  It is then given short variation treatment in the styles of Bartok, Stravinsky, Prokofiev, and Rachmaninov, in that order.  The rest of the work is a mirror-image of itself right back to the very beginning. The fourth movement only lasts around a minute, and is a setting of the medieval melody (anonymously written) of the same name. 'Mache Dich Mein Geist Bereit' is a setting of a chorale melody, in quickly contrasting alternating sections of a March and a \"Pseudo-Adagio\" (which is at the same speed as the march, but the notes are obviously held much longer).  Mahler probably would have hated this piece, but I don't care, I will always love Mahler's music. 'Shir Ha-Shirim' is a toccata-like distortion of a medieval Jewish setting of a text from the Song of Songs, III / 1, \"By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loved; I sought him, but I found him not.\"  The Song of Songs is a love-song from God to Israel and vice-versa and it is read at Passover.  After a short reprise of Hore Cerny the melody returns to the toccata, thereafter quietly dispersing. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

This experience meant that the writing of this work came naturally. Written while studying in Wellington, the Mass is one of the first of her works that Gillian heard performed; the Victoria University choir conducted by Robert Oliver sang selected movements, while its first complete performance, in an otherwise �all Bach� concert by the Leonine Consort in Sydney, was broadcast on television.  The reviewer of this concert, Roger Covell, wrote �Gillian Whitehead�s Missa Brevis easily rose to the challenge of justifying its presence� (showing) rare understanding of how to write for concerted voices; everything she calculated on paper worked in practice in this tenderly beautiful performance�.

Ideas for the text and musical form were workshopped with some of the students and their teacher, Wendy Richards in October, 2005, and again in March, 2006. The finished work looks at ideas about difference, belonging and finding common ground; a lyrical opening and closing section frames a more energetic middle section exploring ideas of conflict and tension, before finally the choir is able to unite (come together) at the end of the piece.    The piece received its first performance at the National School for the Blind and Vision Impaired annual national music camp held in Manurewa, Manukau City, in July, 2006.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Christina Rossetti's sonnet \"Remember\" first appeared in \"Goblin Market\" and Other Poems in 1862, and was both warmly and sadly received by readers. Like much of Rossetti's poetry, a mixture of happiness and depression tends to run throughout the poem. One writer comments: Whether it was her struggle with debilitating illnesses or a desire to meet her maker, Rossetti appears to have been obsessed with her own pending death. \"Remember\" couples this persistent thought with an awkward love affair, one in which the speaker, presumably the poet herself, confesses that she may not be as passionately in love with her suitor as he is with her. But since she believes she is going to die anyway, her ambivalence toward him is not the most important issue. Instead, the dominant concern becomes how he will remember her when she is gone. Will he think of her and recall the pain of not knowing whether she truly loved him or will he remember, rightly or wrongly, that she adored him as much as he adored her?* Christina Rossetti was born into an artistic family. One of her brothers was Dante Gabriel Rossetti - the painter and a poet - while the other was William Michael Rossetti - a leading art critic and editor. It was William who edited her complete works in 1904 (10 years after her death).  At one stage she was engaged to painter James Collinson - a member of the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood - but the engagement was broken off in 1850.  Her poetry, which is often compared to that of Emily Bronte, is characterized by an overwhelming sense of melancholy. Rossetti contracted cancer in 1891, but an operation prolonged her life until December 1894. �Remember� was commissioned by North Shore Ladies Choir (Auckland) and their conductor Sheila Fox Evans.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work was commissioned by The Southern Consort of Voices in 1991, with funding from Creative NZ.  It sets three NZ poems to music, with a fourth song being wordless:  Timepiece - poem by Cilla McQueen  Before the Fall - poem by Rachel McAlpine  I lie, I watch the ceiling (wordless)  We could just disappear - poem by Sam Hunt   In 2001 Auckland choir Viva Voce recorded this work on their CD entitled 'Snapshots - A Cappella Choral Favourites' (contact: songanddance@xtra.co.nz).  Conductor John Rosser writes of the work -   \"Anthony has a wonderful knack of writing for voice.  'Timepiece' portrays a woman struggling to break free of suburban neurosis and the tyranny of time.  'Before the Fall' alludes to lost childhood innocence, and 'We Could just Disappear' depicts the future as an endless tunnel of the mind.\"  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The legend relates how a chief living on the plains is unhappy at the constant breezes coming from the direction of the Southern Alps.  He instructs a tohunga to conduct a sacred ceremony to make the mountains taller, thus obstructing the wind�s progress; the subsequent stillness of air, however, causes the plains to be too damp for the people living on them, who request the winds to return.  The winds then respond with ever more strength to force their passage over the Alps.  The piece begins and concludes with homages to the four directions. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This piece was inspired by the famous Pink and White Terraces in New Zealand which were destroyed by the eruption of Mt Tarawera in 1886.  The Pink and White Terraces were huge naturally occuring staircases, created by deposits of silica in crystallised form over many centuries. People came from all over the world to view the terraces, described as the eighth wonder of the world.   According to legend, there was a premonition of the disaster in June, 1886.  While travelling across a lake near the terraces, some tourists and their Maori guide saw a mysterious canoe  of Maoris nearby.  They disappeared and were never seen again, and no reasonable explanation could be given for their existence.  However, some local Maori took this 'spirit-canoe' as an omen.  They were right. Before dawn the next day, Mt Tarawera erupted for five hours, destoying the Pink and White Terraces and killing 153 people.  It was New Zealand's worst volcanic disaster of recorded times.   This organ piece attempts to incorporate elements of the story into its musical gestures. The big opening chords describes the might and force of Mt Tarawera.  Then follow two quieter ideas, interrelated, which portray the gently bubbling beauty of the 'White Terrace' and then the 'Pink Terrace'. The eruption is heralded by low thundering trills on the pedals and sweeping upward runs on the keyboard.  The main theme that follows is toccato-like and conjures up visions of wild panic among the people.  This theme reappears on full organ at the climax, and the music gradually subsides.  The Tarawera chords from the beginning return like a solemn chorale for the dead, and the music drifts off into the distance, like smoke from the crater.   Pink and White was commissioned by Martin Setchell with funding from Creative New Zealand, and was composed especially for the new Christchurch Town Hall Rieger organ.  The composer is indebted to Martin Setchell for his advice and help with scoring for the organ.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: �Have you ever lost your mouth or anything in that small area... your lips, your teeth, your tongue, your tonsils? The throat � everything around there. You�d be in deep stew, yes.� � Patti Labelle, Moon Shadow Listening to the Hammond-centred sound of the Peddlers in my parents� car in 1974, I'd feel positively queasy. Ransacking my Dad�s cassette collection a few years, I stumbled across some of this old �driving music�. Somehow I no longer felt nauseous when I listened to it. Around the same time I bought my brother a collection of Rare Groove for his 30th birthday. One of the stand-out tracks is of Patti Labelle singing her version of Cat Stevens� Moonshadow. The central section is an insanely long rant by Labelle in which each of the musicians solo (including a fabulous Hammond improv). Deep Stew takes it title and its spirit from this crazy sequence of �what if�s. Commissioned by the Composers� Association of New Zealand with funds from the QEII Arts Council, Deep Stew was premiered in 1994 at Wellington Town Hall, New Zealand. The Bang on a Can All-Stars gave the work its American premiere in 1995 at New York�s Lincoln Center. The current arrangement is a new revised version written especially for the California EAR Unit.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: During 1983 Epsom Girls Grammar School and Auckland Grammar School undertook a co-production of Shakespeare�s �Othello�, for which I was asked to compose incidental music. The producer gave me a free hand with my approach to the score, and the 12 musicians played about half an hour�s music during the play. One aspect of �Othello� that appealed was the fact that three songs had to be set to music - the 2 drinking songs in Act 2, and the well-known �Willow Song� in Act 4. I knew from the time I had been asked to compose the music that I didn�t want to write �pseudo-Elizabethan� music. Hence, the first drinking song is a �blues� number, and the second a lively setting containing constant time signature changes. In this arrangement for SSATB voices I have used the drinking songs to frame the �Willow Song� - a gentle and reflective setting featuring the melody mainly in the alto part.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: A medicine bundle is part of the traditional teachings and practices of the First Nations peoples of North America.  The title of the first Medicine Bundle piece, which I wrote as one of the many invited composers worldwide to contribute a piece for pianist Ananda Sukarlan�s Concerts for Bali commemorating the Bali bombing of October 2002, was my response to an article published in the Toronto Star, where an elder of the Six Nations Reserve of southern Ontario spoke of a �medicine bundle� found within each of us; a place of healing and transformation which we can tap into in times of strife and need.   I envisaged the bundle in this case as a bundle of notes from which the performer(s) can freely bring their own sensitivities, experiences and responses to the work�s realisation.  In this medicine bundle piece the performer follows the musical lines starting from either the left or right hand side of the page; they are able also to repeat the lines and freely alter the order of performance.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: A Viola on Skye was written and premiered in London in 1976.  It was a commissioned by the Music Society of St Marys, Bryanston Square, London for the New Zealand violist Elizabeth Turnbull.  The work was inspired by a trip to Scotland that included a stay on the Isle of Skye in the depths of winter.  The initial sketches for the work were made at the time, influenced by the bleak, barren but richly hued landscape.  This is personified by the characteristic timbre of the instrument and accounts for the particular sweep and colour of the music. The work falls naturally into two parts and can be described as a transition from complexity to simplicity. The first is characterized by a great variety of activity - agitated configurations, short melodic phrases, alternations of sul pont, pizzicato, arco, tremolo and so on.  The structure is loosely based on a twelve note series and features a series of twelve groups.  These are short sections of music, each emphasising one of the notes of the series.  There are only four types of groups used so the first part of the work can be heard as three related variations. The second part of the work uses the series material melodically.  It opens with these notes presented in the order and registers established in the preceding part.  Ultimately this develops into an extended melodic line with the close of the work attaining the ultimate in simplicity - a repeated note.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

He sets the poem on the boat in which he travelled to New Zealand, and in this musical setting I have suggested a �sea shanty� type of rhythm and flavour to the music. The following note places the author in his context: \"James Edward Fitzgerald (1818-96) was born in Bath and brought up in England. Accepting an administrative post in the British Museum, in his spare time he became very interested in colonial matters. He became a member of the Canterbury Association and apparently wrote many of its important letters. He sailed on the Charlotte Jane. From the start he was a prominent member of the new settlement. He was responsible for the first issue of the Lyttelton Times and became the first Superintendent of Canterbury. Later he founded The Press and entered national politics. His poem 'The ! Night Watch Song of the \"Charlotte Jane'\"�was published in 1900.\" (from �The New Place� edited by Harvey McQueen (Victoria University Press)) �Night Watch Song� was written at the request of Stephen Rowe, one of the choral directors at Rangitoto College (Auckland). His request was for a piece in just 2 parts for male voices, with a tenor part that could be handled by boys with changing voices (i.e. capable of being sung in a low alto range as well as the upper tenor range).

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This short work began from the simple idea of a waltz-like piece. The music is intended to suggest a dream-like atmosphere, perhaps a half-remembered memory of something that happened long ago. Other than that, there is no specific programme to the music. Musically the piece is based around three principal ideas: the interval of a minor third (often heard in a simple oscillation of pitches), a rising arpeggio of a minor 9th chord, and a more angular melodic fragment developed from the opening bars. The music opens with music marked �pensively�, then becomes �a little more decisive�. The climax of the work features pitches at the top of the flute range, and the final section is marked to be played �like an afterthought�. �Dreamwaltz� won the New Zealand Flute Society�s composers� competition for a test piece for their 2006 conference.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: I first heard Cilla McQueen reading her own poems at the opening of the new National Library building in August 1987. Among the poems the read was Synaesthesia, which entranced me with its sustained lyricism and seemed to be crying out for music � something very unusual in recent NZ poetry, most of which tends to be more conversational in tone. I asked her for a copy of Synaesthesia (at that stage unpublished) and later formed two other poems among her published collections. The musical connections between Synaesthesia and Princess Alice came quite unconsciously, though the two songs are very contrasted in rhythmic style: one flowing, the other dancing. In between, Solstice is suspended in stillness.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Elegy' is my personal reflection on the events of September 11th, 2001, their aftermath and the fixation on and use of violence in our global culture.  Although the piece took me just over six months to complete, I started writing it shortly after the attacks on the Twin Towers.  I was living in Wells, and was physically very distanced from the events that the world observed taking place in America and later in Afghanistan, Bali, Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Spain. In this piece, I am exploring both the horrific tragedy of the situation, and the American response to that day.  It is an emotional response to the tragedy and not in any way programmatic.  Essentially �Elegy� is a work full of hope. Hope that it is possible to find better ways to resolve conflict within our world. Hope that it is possible for different cultures and beliefs to coexist with understanding and tolerance for others. Hope that people will not see everything as black and white with only one right way or answer and not be influenced by ignorance or greed. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The title indicates a final farewell to a Hero, famous as one of New Zealand's most important composers. The prelude is a lament, a wordless song that is mesto, thoughtfully sad, rather than gloomy. A motif quoted from \"Aotearoa Overture\" identifies the Hero, and us. The lyrical pensive prelude melody composed with modal phrases evocative of Lilburn's background. The fugal part energetically celebrate his academic status and international fame with a theme derived from transformations of the heroic Eb motif from Beethoven's \"Eroica\" Symphony; this emerges only when my theme unravels its transformations towards the end. Just before the end each violin refers to the New Zealand National Anthem, and there is an impassioned cadence in the relative key of c-minor, but the last fading sound is an ambiguous interval. After Lilburn, what next?  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In 1909 Alice Adcock, a lively and adventurous young woman from Manchester, was on her way to New Zealand. She was 23, and had recently developed TB, for which there was then no cure. Somehow she persuaded her widowed father to let her travel alone to the other side of the world in case a healthy climate would save her life. (It worked � she lived for another 50 years). The family kept her entertaining letter describing shipboard life, and a few postcards from her have also survived, but most of what we know about her time in New Zealand comes from her father�s letters to her, of which he kept copies, or from family tradition. On her arrival in New Zealand, Alice went into service, travelling widely, much to the consternation of her father. As housekeeper (and the only woman) on a farm in Makarora (a remote settlement on Lake Wanaka) she became pregnant to an unknown man, but was �rescued� by marriage to a local farmer, Charles Pipson, shortly before the birth of her daughter. In 1911, her beloved father died; in 1912, Alice and Charles had a son and the following year, pregnant again, Alice took her children back to England to visit her family. Tragically, while she was away, her husband died suddenly of typhoid fever. Alice hurried back to Makarora to claim her inheritance, but left the two babies with her brother Sam and his wife (who were shortly to emigrate to New Zealand) and took only her eldest child, the illegitimate one, with her. This outraged her sisters-in-law, who saw it as an insult to their dead brother; they sent her away from the farm empty-handed. Once again she had to take a housekeeping job, this time in the North Island. In 1914, Alice and her brother�s family met up again, and Alice began a new life. (Fleur Adcock � abridged) The music of Alice is text-driven, ranging between a language at times extremely simple, as was the basic musical language of the settlers, and at times quite complex, evoking a storm at sea, or the unease of the settlers in a new environment, or Alice�s reaction to the problems which beset her. The piece is held together by various referential motifs. The initial idea, which perhaps suggests the instability of the sea, is also present in the bell-like sounds marking Charles� death, music associated with a storm at sea is later associated with mental stress, while music suggestive of the movement of shipboard lice later underlies Alice�s traumatic encounter with her sisters-in-law. There are eight sections, which often merge into one another: 1. in a letter to her father, Alice describes shipboard life; 2. in New Zealand, she compares her past life and hopes for the future; 3. a dialogue between father and daughter, expressed through their letters; 4. in Makarora, Alice discovers she is pregnant; 5. Alice hears of her father�s death; 6. in England, she learns of her husband�s death; 7. back in Makarora, Alice is turned away by her sisters-in-law; 8. turning her back on the South Island, Alice looks forward to her new life with her brother�s family in the north. While writing this piece, I was drawn again and again into the thought that, although this is a true story, set in a particular place at a certain time, it has the resonances of a universal myth, known to all of us who live here. Our forebears, or we ourselves, have crossed the seas to begin a new life, with unforeseen and unimaginable difficulties and felicities, whether ten years, a century or a millennium or so ago.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Although the title comes from the hymn \"All People That On Earth Do Dwell\", this work is more concerned with the pleasures and pitfalls of aging, than with piety. The texts are from a collection of writings (both poetry and prose) associated with each age from birth to 99 years old. The selection I made was purely of those items which appealed to me personally - some are humorous, others more serious, some cynical whereas others contain wisdom. \"From Age to Age Endure\" was commissioned by Auckland Youth Choir, and is affectionately dedicated to them and their conductor at the time, Brigid McLafferty. I was asked to write a work with jazz influences, and although not a great jazz fancier, I hope I have created a work which is fun to sing and enjoyable to listen to. The work is scored for solo soprano, SATB choir and small ensemble (or piano duet). Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The first movement opens quietly with a number of ideas in which the melodic interval of a fifth has some prominence. A faster section follows and the development of these ideas leads to climaxes with patterns of diverse rhythms superimposed.  After the final climax the movement subsides to a quiet ending. The second movement has the character of a Scherzo. Lively  rhythms alternating between 6/8 and 3/4 lead to a quieter sustained \"trio\" tune. The scherzo resumes and takes the music to a climax where these two ideas are presented together - the faster one (violins and trumpets) across the slower (horns and trombones). The music unwinds until we are left with a fragment of the slower theme, which becomes a link to the third movement. The finale has the form of a free passacaglia. It grows out of the opening trumpet tune and its accompaniment - the trumpet tune becomes the passacaglia bass, while the stepwise bass takes over as melody. At the end of the movement a reference back to the melodic falling fifths of the first movement leads to the final chord - fading from brass to wind, and in the end, to strings alone.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This short work was written at the request of Rachel Young , conductor of Auckland Youth Choir. The choir�s 2006 Christmas concert was to also involve the Auckland Girls Choir, Auckland Boys Choir, and Aotea Youth Symphony Orchestra. A work which could open the concert, involve all performers, and make use of the performance space was needed. And it had to be easy to learn and quick to put together! After considering various texts I approached noted New Zealand hymn writer Marnie Barrel to ask if she had anything suitable as a text. She very kindly wrote the text that I used for the work. Each choir has an energetic presentation of a verse which describes some of the features and feelings of Christmas. This is followed by an Alleluia. Towards the end of the work, the Alleluia becomes the basis of a canon for all the choirs along with the orchestra.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'valse triste' is a simple work and should not be over-romanticized, particularly in the �music-box� ending where the tempo winds down expressionlessly.  When a child's toy winds down it does so because the spring has run out, or the clockwork mechanism has run its course - the meaning or emotion we put into this is of our own making. The message going through my mind while working on this piece was �less is more�.  See for yourself - put a lot of expression into it then try it again with very little.  The effect is very revealing. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The request was for a fairly straightforward and melodic setting, with accompaniment by a small ensemble allowing some of the school�s fine wind players to participate. An alternative accompaniment for solo piano is also included in the score. I was also asked to consider using the version of Psalm 121 from the NZ Prayer Book. It is a fairly free adaptation of the text in contemporary language. After considering various translations from different Bibles I decided the suggested translation was a very suitable one for a school choir as it avoided some of the more archaic language in other versions. An �Amen� has been added to the text, and the work ends by returning to the opening lines of the psalm. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In the tradition of the Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, Hine Raukatauri is the goddess of music and dance. She is embodied in the form of the female case-moth, who hangs in the bushes and sings in a pure, high voice to attract the male moths to her.  Her hair is found as a fern, the hanging spleenwort, and her voice is heard in the sound of the putorino, an instrument known only in Aotearoa (the Maori name for New Zealand). The putorino is an instrument that can be played in various ways � as a flute, as a trumpet and as a means of enhancing or altering the human voice. 'Hine Raukatauri' is written for two performers, one playing conventional flutes (piccolo, C and alto flutes), and the other for taonga puoro (instruments). The score features three different putorino, which, like all taonga puoro, (and also the songs and chants) have a small pitch range, rarely exceeding a fourth, which varies from instrument to instrument. Three putorino are used in this piece � one made of albatross bone and two of wood, and both the flute and trumpet voices are used. Other instruments used are a karanga manu (bird-caller), a purerehua (swung bull-roarer) and tumutumu (tapped instruments.)  The flute player�s part is notated, but the music for the taonga puoro is improvised; there are areas when the flute player is encouraged to improvise with the taonga.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: While overseas in 1989 I came upon the book by Erik Routley \"A Panorama of Christian Hymnody\" - a sourcebook of hymns and other sacred texts. These four carols draw their texts from that book: the first two by Christina Rossetti (1830-1894), the third by Eustace Condor (1820-1892), and the fourth by James Lowell (1819-1891). The fact that the poets are contemporaries is quite coincidental - these are texts which appealed and which appear to form a satisfactory cycle (although individual pieces may be performed separately). \"Love Came Down at Christmas\" is a popular and widely set Christmas text, and originally appeared in \"Time Flies: A Reading Diary\", while \"The Shepherds had an Angel\" comes from Rossetti's \"Poetical Works\". Both texts were originally intended as hymns for children. \"The Childhood of Christ\" was also a children's hymn and is drawn from the Congregational Church Hymnal of 1867, whereas the \"Epiphany Carol\" appeared in the 1865 publication 'Songs of the Sanctuary'. Over a number of years I have written short Christmas pieces for groups directed by John Rosser - the Summer Singers, Quintessence, the Star Quartet and his fine chamber choir Viva Voce. These four piece are dedicated to John and Kathryn Rosser as an appreciation for their interest in my music and willingness to perform (and record) it. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Two of the pieces are arrangements- number one is an arrangement of the first of my February pieces for piano solo; while the ninth prelude is an arrangement of the traditional Japanese folksong Songs at Mamuro River.  The other pieces explore a range of melodic and harmonic figures, especially those based on the intervals of a third and fourth, and range from written out improvisations to dance-like numbers.  I would like to thank Kazuhito for his advice while composing these preludes.      Commissioned by and dedicated to Kazuhito Yamashita, and first performed by him along with solo and ensemble pieces by Chinary Ung and Josefino Chino Toledo in Kyoto and Tokyo in November 1997.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This is my first work for flute and piano since three very early (and probably best forgotten) flute sonatas written while studying at university. However, over the years the flute has been an important instrument in my writing, having been used prominently in several choral works and in other chamber scores. This piece was prompted by the marriage of one of my former students from Epsom Girls Grammar School, Elizabeth Hirst. Liz was part of a quite exceptional group of students that went through the school in the years 1983 to 1987, several of whom have ended up in musical careers internationally (Liz has spent much of her subsequent life in Germany). During her time at the school Liz played in a number of works of mine, most notably �Darkness� for 14 solo voices and flute, and �Slides 8� for solo flute. This work started with the 3rd movement (originally planned as a stand-alone piece) and evolved into a four movement work. The whole work is intended to be an evocation of aspects of the night. The first movement, �Lullaby�, begins with a small quotation from �Slides 8� and then into a gentle rocking movement suggestive of a lullaby. The flute part could be considered as a mother quietly humming or singing to her child. The second movement is an adaptation of a song from my song cycle �Night Songs� (2002). The busy accompaniment suggests the fireflies darting about. The text of the poem begins: �The fireflies wink and glow, the night is on the march, the cricket clacks his castanets, and the moon hangs in the larch...�. The third movement is a reflective �night piece� while the final piece is a more exuberant piece perhaps suggesting someone dancing under the moon. The final movement also reprises elements from earlier movements, most specifically from the first movement. The music is a mix of free tonality, octatonic writing (music using an 8-note scale of alternating tones and semitones) and minimalist procedures. There is little use of �extended� playing techniques beyond some pitch bending and �inside the piano� techniques. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The title of the piece combines two Maori words �Matai� (sea) and �Rangi� (sky). The work is inspired by the Wellington environment,  particularly tui birdsong and also both reflective and sparkling waters. It is perhaps best summed up by a New Zealand adaptation of some lines in T.S. Eliot�s �Four Quartets�: �After the [tui�s] wing Has answered light to light, and is silent, the light is still At the still point of the turning world� �Matairangi - 2� for flutes (C-flute, alto flute and piccolo),viola and harp, was commisssioned by Catherine and Christine Bowie with funding provided by Creative New Zealand Toi Aotearoa, and it was premiered by Trio Bilitis on 13 July 1997 for the Wellington Chamber Music Society. �Matairangi - 2� was recorded by Trio Bilitis for the CD �Matairangi - Helen Fisher Chamber Music� which is available at SOUNZ, the Centre for New Zealand Music.

This cycle of structurally-related songs with the inclusion of 'Anthem to the Dawn' and 'The Babbling Brook' became a suite of eight pieces.  The suite begins with 'Anthem to the Dawn' inspired by a poem the composer's wife, Rae, wrote a number of years ago.  The grandioso section of the final movement, 'Motion', posed a problem in orchestrating the rolling arpeggios with sustaining pedal of the original piano part. I acknowledge Michael's suggested solution which helped to retain a similar effect within the limitation of the four instruments. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The texts for these three pieces all come from �The Oxford Treasury of Time Poems�, hence the title of the short cycle. They were prompted by a request for something fairly straightforward and quick to learn for the choir of Marlborough Boys� College. The first piece of the cycle was written for that choir, and I decided to complete a short set of pieces on the subject of time. �Old Man Know-All� tells of someone who won�t listen and thinks he knows everything, leading to his demise. The text is a traditional one, probably American in origin. The first verse presents the main melody without any other vocal accompaniment, and thereafter a number of ostinato-like patterns feature as accompaniment. The piece ends with a short canon for the voices. The piano part has an insistent bass line setting off some more jazzy rhythms in the treble. The second piece sets a short poem by Christina Rossetti. Here the voices are unaccompanied. It presents the thoughts of someone looking to a point beyond their b=death, and the fact that he or she will no longer be concerned with the sights and sounds of life. The third piece sets an anonymous text about the Judgement Day. Each day of the week is presented with an associated climatic event: a great storm on Monday, the freezing on Tuesday, the wind on Wednesday, the rain on Thursday, a dark cloud on Friday, and finally the great sea on Saturday. The music uses a vigorous gospel-spiritual style. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: A medicine bundle is part of the traditional teachings and practices of the First Nations peoples of North America.  The title of the first Medicine Bundle piece, which I wrote as one of the many invited composers worldwide to contribute a piece for pianist Ananda Sukarlan�s Concerts for Bali commemorating the Bali bombing of October 2002, was my response to an article published in the Toronto Star, where an elder of the Six Nations Reserve of southern Ontario spoke of a �medicine bundle� found within each of us; a place of healing and transformation which we can tap into in times of strife and need.   I envisaged the bundle in the three previous Medicine Bundle pieces as consisting of a bundle of notes from which the performer(s) can freely bring their own sensitivities, experiences and responses to the work�s realisation.  Unlike my other medicine bundle pieces however, this Medicine Bundle does not allow for different realisations of the score - instead, the focus is on the different voices \"speaking together\" in a common tongue.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: American poet Jack Prelutsky is best known for his numerous anthologies of children�s poetry. Since 1996 I have set a number of his poems, most substantially in the cycle for choir and brass band �The Dragons are Singing Tonight� and �Monday�s Troll� for choir and orchestra. However he has also written poems for older readers, some of which appeared as the 1991 collection ��There�ll be a Slight Delay� and other poems for grown-ups�. In this collection are musings on various facets of contemporary life: everything from sexual infidelity to what dogs do on footpaths! �I Watched a Televangelist� is a commentary on the typical (American) television preacher. Out to get your money, they promise salvation in return for your contribution, although perhaps not as blatantly as the one in the poem. The music includes passing references to several hymns, the �Hallelujah� Chorus, and suggests the style of the �Battle Hymn of the Republic�. The original version of this piece was written for Auckland choir GALS (Gay and Lesbian Singers) many of whose members, I felt, would respond to the text�s somewhat jaundiced view of religion.

She assists at the entrances into and the exits from the world, with rituals concerned with tattooing of the lips prior to marriage, with the raising of tapu, and she is credited by some iwi with the introduction of weaving into the culture. Generally, sge supports the role of women in traditional society.  Hineteiwaiwa was written at the time that Tungia Baker, herself an exemplary wahine toa, or woman of strength, was dying, and is dedicated to her memory.  In the improvisatory sections, which are guided and shaped by the taonga puoro player, there are few indications in the score. Generally, the improvisations involve the percussionist.

Kukutauaki stood in the middle of an area hostile to the Rangitane people.  On his way to the feast Mahuri was warned of the danger of entering territory controlled by the powerful and dangerous Te Rauparaha whereupon he replied: \"It is the boast of Te Puoho that he will not have his forehead smeared with blood.\" After the feast at which a new kind of food, the pumpkin, was introduced, the guests were invited back to Maimea, at the mouth of the Waikanae River, and massacred - most likely at the prompting of Te Rauparaha. This work was composed in 1987, commissioned and first performed by the New Zealand Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Anthony Jeenings.

In the second part a cantabile melody is heard over a low ostinato of a perfect fifth.  The third and most lively section is what I term a �rhythmic variation�; a repeated melody where the pitches remain constant while the rhythmic values change with each subsequent repetition.  A melodic development leads to a short coda revisiting the figure heard at the beginning of the piece. Written for and dedicated to Ben Hoadley, in friendship. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Hineputehue translates literally as the woman of the sound of the gourd, and she is the Maori goddess of peace. The work was written in 2001, at the time of President Bush's State of the Union address shortly before the invasion of Afghanistan, and suggests the fragility rather than the celebration of peace, particularly in a pre-European environment. A number of instruments used in Hineputehue are made of gourds - the gourd, which carried food and water, is a symbol of peace. These include the poi awiowhio, a very quiet bird lure which is swung around the head, the tiny koauau ponga ihu or noseflute which ends the piece, the hue puru hau, a large gourd which is blown across its top opening and the gourd rattles played by the quartet. Two other wind instruments frequently made from gourds, the nguru and the ororuarangi, are also used. Other instruments are the putatara or conch shell trumpet, traditionally used for signalling, the pu kaea or war trumpet, a nguru niho paraoa or flute made from a whale's tooth, the pumotomoto, associated with birth, and tumutumu (tapped percussion). There is a similarity between the stringed instruments of the quartet and the gourds, in that they are made from plant material, with sound emitted through sound holes. Another link is the ku, the only stringed instrument known to Maori, which is a small musical bow played like a jaws harp (jews harp) using the mouth as a resonating chamber. The idea of ororuarangi, which can be translated as spirit voice (or double stopping in a different context) has had some influence on this piece as in the parallel movement of the strings.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Toccata for Orchestra' is a virtuoso showcase overture that encompasses dark sinister elements which undergo vast transformations. Its dark opening theme changes into a cheesy jazz melody, to a flatulent brass passage then to a violent climax. The ending is a loud juxtaposition of darkness and cheese similar to the tuning of a radio when it is receiving two frequencies at the same time. In the end the melody takes the focus with every instrument playing at full noise. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: I  Sculptures  II  Travelling  III  Passing  IV  Elements    Central Otago holds a special place in the hearts of many people. This is clear to see in the wonderful book called Timeless Land which combines the paintings of Grahame Sydney with the writings of Brian Turner and Owen Marshall.  We decided early on to focus on the Maniototo, which is Grahame's spiritual heartland and which has inspired so many of his great works. For me the Maniototo suggests a variety of feelings: awe at the expansiveness of the land and the surrounding ranges.  There is the exhilarating beauty of the different seasons: the Autumnal colours for instance, or the bleak Winter images.   There is the strange sense of freedom and escape that one experiences driving through the Maniototo.  There can also be an overwhelming sense of loneliness, and feelings of insignificance when placed in such a vast, un-peopled landscape.  Then there are the reminders of human impermanence, with decaying and abandoned structures, old graveyards and memorials.  The Maniototo will mean different things to different people, but in this work I have tried to portray it in sound, as I feel it in my heart. So the music is not simply descriptive, or impressionistic; it also reflects human moods and emotions.   While the music is designed to be combined with images, it can also stand alone.  There is a loose symphonic structure in the four movements, with recurring themes and motifs.  Most significant of these are the opening cornet melody, and an assertive cornet call that first appears in the middle of the second movement.  This cornet call has a vague connection with The Last Post, and becomes a reminder of death in the third movement.  Most themes and ideas in the music derive from the manipulations of a 5-note motif, using magic squares.  The 5-note motif, which is never openly revealed in the piece, comes from a short Magnificat, composed at the time of my mother's death in 2001.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The six preludes were conceived as solo pieces for each of the six instruments of the ensemble, with the accompaniment being little more than a faint shadow cast by the solo player.  By contrast the postlude requires each player to relinquish their individuality and be absorbed by the ensemble, forming a dense and ever changing kaleidoscope of sound. In spite of the apparent contrasts between all seven movements they are, at a level beneath the surface, all manifestations of the same basic material and represent seven possible outcomes of the same process of growth. \"six preludes and a postlude\" was commissioned by Chamber Music New Zealand Inc with the assistance of Creative New Zealand, Toi Aotearoa.  It is dedicated to John Rimmer with thanks for his patient guidance and encouragement. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The area is treeless, rocky, sparsely populated, and the piece reflects the sounds, silences and ghosts of the area.  'Bright Silence' was written while Gillian Whitehead was composer-in-residence with the Auckland Philharmonia, as the competition piece for the inaugural Michael Hill World Violin Competition, held at Queenstown, New Zealand, where it received its first eighteen performances in June 2001.

By amplifying the cello, many of the smaller nuances in the sounds can be heard, allowing the piece to be more intimate in nature. The work brings together two disparate sound worlds: a series of melodic lines and a set of noise-oriented glissandos.   It is the balance and juxtaposition of these two sonic elements which gives the piece its expressive meaning,  producing a sense of movement and progression while simultaneously seeming to remain stationary.

Although the words arrived late in the process, they go some way towards describing the forces at work. Propelled by small-scale rhythmic articulation, strands reach out towards points, tracing delicate spirals through space. Alongside these sit diffuse clouds of material, out of which new constellations take shape. There is above all a concern with the intimate connection between the gestures of performance and their sonic result. The instruments act as filters which shape raw sound in a manner reminiscent of the procedures of the electroacoustic studio. There is a constant tension between organic direction and quite arbitrary frameworks, a mesh of non-congruent processes operating on different structural levels. In front of this, the intricate detail of the audible surface attempts to impose perceptual order on the precariously balanced network of forces. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: According to legend, St. Vitus was the Christian son of a pagan senator of Lucania, Italy. He was known for his  miracle-working, although his father tried to make him abandon his faith, through sometimes violent means. He  fled with his tutor Modestus to Rome, where he was taken to exorcize the evil spirits from Emperor Diocletian�s  possessed son. This he did, and yet, because he remained steadfast in the Christian Faith, he was once more tortured  along with Modestus and his nurse Crescentia. By a miracle an angel brought back the martyrs to Lucania, where  they died from the tortures they had endured.  'Vitus' reflects this legend by setting out a slowly modulating tetrachord articulated by the strings and brass,  which the woodwinds �torture� by means of completing the full chromatic gamut of pitches in sweeping moments  of violent dissonance.  The central section suggests an episode of St Vitus Dance, also known as Sydenham�s Chorea and Rheumatic  Chorea, a temporary disorder of the brain that manifests itself in continuous, involuntary jerking movements.

Since 1996 I have set a number of his poems, most substantially in the cycle for choir and brass band �The Dragons are Singing Tonight� and �Monday�s Troll� for choir and orchestra. However he has also written poems for older readers, some of which appeared as the 1991 collection ��There�ll be a Slight Delay� and other poems for grown-ups�. In this collection are musings on various facets of contemporary life: everything from sexual infidelity to what dogs do on footpaths! �I Watched a Televangelist� is a commentary on the typical (American) television preacher. Out to get your money, they promise salvation in return for your contribution, although perhaps not as blatantly as the one in the poem. The music includes passing references to several hymns, the �Hallelujah� Chorus, and suggests the style of the �Battle Hymn of the Republic�. The original version of this piece was written for Auckland choir GALS (Gay and Lesbian Singers) many of whose members, I felt, would respond to the text�s somewhat jaundiced view of religion. This re-working for male voices was made in 2004. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'dans la nuit' is based on a motif of a sustained note and a small range of glissandi notes. The motif follows an irregular rhythmic pattern which creates a feeling of uncertainty. The chromatic possibilities of the main theme have been explored and build on the initial uncertainty culminating in an atmosphere of apprehension and at times suspense.   I was inspired to create this work after hearing a violinist improvising on a chromatic scale exercise.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This piece was composed in response to a commission from Auckland band conductor Peter Thomas. The brief was for a slow, chorale-like piece.   Several months prior to my commencement of this piece, I was involved in the performance of a 1920s song called 'When Day Is Done' (composer: Dr. Robert Katscher; lyricist: B.G De Sylva). It was a favourite song of renowned bandleader Paul Whiteman, who had had it played at his funeral.  However, this sad, poignant song took on a similar resonance for me when I played it � the pianist in the band I performed it with had recently passed away. It was, needless to say, a terribly sad time for all of us, and this feeling lingered on for me to influence the composition of this piece, whose title alludes to the title of the song.   Overall, this piece is about saying goodbye � another song to exert a mild influence was 'Bye Bye Blues' (written by Fred Hamm/Dave Bennett/Bert Lown/Chaunccy), which comes from a similar era to 'When Day Is Done'.

The piece, written for large choir and a small brass ensemble, is an evocation of an estuary at the turn of the tide. Although the poem itself describes Aramoana at the mouth of Otago harbour (significant at the time because of the threat of the aluminium smelter that, because of the strength of local protest, was in fact not built), for the composer it was the estuary where the Ruakaka river meets the sea south of Whangarei was significant.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This piece was composed in close collaboration with Andrew Sparling whose facility in using quarter-tone fingerings made it possible to experiment with these to produce music which exploits their timbral and colouristic qualities. It was stimulated by a return visit, following a seven-year absence, to New Zealand in 2002. Imagery of the sea is strong within its musical/poetic discourse and the piece is broadly structured over a cycle of seven 'intensity waves'. The title [�and�1] is shared by an earlier work [�and�11] for 12 players (composed for Lontano in 2002). The link between these contrasting works is the morphology of the wave, encapsulated as a sonic envelope of aspirate (a) - resonant (n) - explosive (d), along with the extremes of space that are characterised in the music by extreme contrasts in dynamic, register and motion. Sparling has performed and recorded the piece in a number of different realisations. In April it was performed by Australian player Richard Haynes at the TURA International Festival in Perth and broadcast by ABC. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

My title was partly motivated by the famous Handel precedent, but focuses on creatures that live in the sea. The first movement is titled 'Seahorses' and captures the gently undulating movements of these small creatures. More dramatic gestures suggest the ebb and flow of the sea. The second movement is titled 'Sting rays' and the music suggests the slowly flapping motion of the rays. In the third movement, 'Dolphins', the orchestra presents an energetic theme, and the movement is full of strong, upward sweeping gestures. A piccolo solo in the middle section derives from the opening, and portrays a baby dolphin. The work ends with a blow from the dolphin's spout. This 12 minute-commissioned work was first performed in 1994, and recorded for Concert FM under the baton of John Matheson.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In Procession I use several unorthodox playing techniques on the gamelan.  The tunings of pelog and slendro are combined freely throughout; the piano remains tuned as is usual (well-tempered chromatic).  The instruments are not dampened, but are left to ring on while subsequent notes are played, giving the effect of clouds of sound.  Compositionally as well the piece is not at all conventional, but explores the gamelan in different ways both harmonically and melodically.   In the first movement this is through combining the close intervals between the pelog and slendro modes; in �Quartet� through step-wise ascending movement; in the fifth movement, a transcription of a short Liszt Ave Maria, the gamelan approximates the triadic harmonies of the piano original.  The third movement, Melody in Pelog and Slendro, is closest to a traditional Javanese composition, although here the free intermingling of the two modes creates an unusual effect.  As well, various instruments are used in atypical ways- the Gong in the first movement struck with an open palm and functioning as a rhythmic marker, or the kempul in the third movement acting as an ostinato; over this rebab and gender elaborate melodic patterns combining the two tunings. The piano is sometimes used as a timbral device (as in the opening movement) and sometimes more in a melodic manner, as in the �Finale�.  Composed for pianist Dan Poynton and Gamelan Padhang Moncar of Victoria University of Wellington, who gave the first performance at the Composers� Association of New Zealand 20th Birthday celebrations in Wellington in November 1994.   Recorded by the same artists on Tabuh Pacific (Ode Record Company, CD Manu 1514).  Movement II, �Quartet� appears on the Centre for New Zealand Music (SOUNZ) Guide for Schools �SOUNZwrite Ears Wide Open Education Resource� CD, while Movement V Ave Maria is on the double CD issued by the New Zealand Geographic in their December 2006 issue featuring New Zealand composers.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: BOLD AS BRASS is written for a brass quintet consisting of two trumpets, horn, trombone and tuba. The work is designed to show to best advantage the varying qualities and abilities of each of these instruments, and accordingly there are solo passages and cadenzas for each.  Hulford has experimented with each line as a \"voice\" and has manipulated and blended the differing timbres to excellent effect. The composition is in 3 movements.  The first and third of these are reasonably fast and are somewhat aggressive in nature while the second is slower and reflective.  The World Premiere of the work occurred in Seoul, Korea, in October 1993 by members of the Korean National Orchestra. The work has not been performed in its entirety in New Zealand.

The manager of Olveston House in Dunedin, Mr Dennis Moore, asked Anthony to play a programme of music in Olveston, on the 1904 grand piano.  In response to a joking suggestion for a piece about the house, Anthony set about composing the Olveston Suite in quick time.   The pieces reflect qualities of the house; 'Great Hall' is expansive and majestic, 'Kitchen and Scullery' is busy and bubbling, while 'Dining room' suggests an old English style.  The fourth piece, 'Writing Room, Edwardian Bedroom' is dedicated to Dorothy Theomin, the daughter of the original owners of Olveston and the last member of the family to live in the house. 'Billiard Room, Persian Room' is fast and jovial with an exotic middle section.  The Suite is rounded off by a repetition of 'Great Hall', as the listener exits Olveston.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: \"The boundary between collection and fetishism is mediated by classification and display in tension with accumulation and secrecy.\"  Two musical strands run virtually throughout this short piece, sometimes clearly differentiated, at other times more obscure and confused, but always at some level presenting an opposition between an 'organic', accretional layer and an 'inorganic' abruptly changing one. This opposition can operate not only at surface level - as it does at the beginning, when two highly differentiated instrumental combinations are presented, each with their own characteristic modes of behaviour - but also at a subcutaneous level, when applied to various ways of generating or modifying the basic material.  These concerns form only the technical armature and implementation of the piece, of course, and much of the original musical imagery was suggested by Borges' short story The Circular Ruins. While giving the obligatory (questionable?) disclaimer about the piece in no way being programmatic, much of the mood and atmosphere of the story was certainly in my mind during the initial sketching stages, and it seems to me that its central conceit - one human dreaming another into existence, by sheer will - is a marvellous metaphor for the act of composition.

It contains a classic Baxter mix of humour and pathos, lively in spirit but focussed on the subject of death, in this case the heart-attack of an overweight publican.  The music is simple and strong, allowing the witty lyrics to speak for themselves, but also adding occasional wry touches of word-painting.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Badb (pronounced �badhv� where �dh� is a voiced fricative, as in �these�) was one of a trio of war-goddesses from Irish legend. She assumed variously the guises of  a beautiful woman, an old hag, and a carrion crow. Her manifestation in the latter form was an omen of death. Before a battle she would appear in anticipation  of the carnage, and as the battle took place, would flit around the heads of the warriors. Afterwards, she would feed on the corpses strewn across the fields. Like  the other two battle-furies, Macha and the M�rr�gan, Badb was both sinister and sexual; she prophesied the end of the world, the fall of the gods and an endless  reign of chaos.  There are three distinct types of material in this piece, portraying the three juxtaposed personalities of Badb: the sinuous, seductive syrensong of sing-flute  representing the mysterious, beautiful femme fatale who befriended the Irish warrior C� Chulainn, then lured him to his death; the unearthly shrieks and  battle-cries of the old hag, which were said to arouse fear and dread in the living; and the hideous crow, pecking at the flesh of the slain with bloodied maw.  Much of the piano�s harmonic structure is derived and interpolated from chords representing the crow in Olivier Messiaen�s 'Catalogue d�Oiseaux', while the notes  B, A and D feature prominently through the piece.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This group of pieces for choir and instrumental ensemble grew out of a short choral fanfare entitled 'Silver Whispers', commissioned by Auckland Choral in 2000.  The original fanfare is now the last piece in a suite of five movements.  The texts are based around the celebration of life in its many manifestations, exploring aspects of spring and the wonders of nature, ranging from the scuttle of insects to the unearthly song of whales, and concluding with a song of praise to the Creator.  A small ensemble of flute, three percussionists, and two pianos (one doubling celesta) gives a flexible group with which to provide atmospheric and varied shades of accompaniment to the singers.  This suite is dedicated to Auckland Choral, conductor Peter Watts, and poet Marnie Barrell. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: �Sings Harry�, a setting of six poems by Denis Glover, tells of an endearingly idiosyncratic New Zealander.  It is a prime example of Lilburn�s subtle handling of poetic texts.  The self-reflective tone of the protagonist, and the slightly complex narrative mode, are established in the first song:  it is Harry�s voice that we hear, Harry singing his home-made song cycle; yet a guiding narrator is ever present to tells us so.  One�s awareness of this narrative voice is enhanced throughout the cycle by the recurrent falling-third motif at the phrase �sings Harry�, and by the composer�s frequent use of a vocal reciting tone or a pitch to which the voice is drawn.  It is nonetheless easy to become absorbed in the various voices of Harry, which range from the crusty critic to the carefree swaggerer.  Lilburn captures the fluctuating temporality and unpredictability of his subject with great sensitivity and humour.  In the final song, a delightful recollective melange of landscapes and uncles, this is achieved by means of recurrent motifs (the �river running by�) and reflective pauses.    �Sings Harry� was released in 1960 on a label called Kiwi New Zealand Composer Edition.  It was the third work by Lilburn to be recorded and the sole piece on a 45 rpm disc. Programme note: Nancy November Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

I wrote the piece, named for the Maori phase of the moon when the new moon is barely apparent, while I was living on the Northumbrian moors north of Hexham. It was a cold winter, and the snow around the small remote cottage, which was not well insulated, lay around for four months as blizzard followed blizzard, and something of the isolation and the environment seems to have got into the piece.  'Hoata' consists of  sections built up in a mosaic-like manner, separated by freer sections, which may be cadenzas, or have a degree of improvisation; there is at times perhaps a suggestion of birdsong.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This orchestral work was especially written for the orchestra in the 2006 Christchurch Primary Schools' Festival.  Following the theme of �celebrations� this piece was inspired by the festival of Semana Santa, held at Easter time in Spain.  I visited Spain many times to see the parades and festivities - the drum and trumpet bands would start playing before dawn and walk through the streets, sometimes very loudly and at other times very solemnly.  'Fiesta!' fuses the Latin American samba band and the Semana Santa idea together into an exciting, rhythmic work.  A samba band starts us off with a �question and answer� wake-up call; just in case we're not fully awake the brass join in; two solo violins introduce a folk song idea which soon grows into the big carnival atmosphere and, at the very end, the band disappears down the street into the distance.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The piece begins quietly, then gradually grows through fast, turbulent music to a large \"crunch\", dissipating slowly, leaving only Cellos and Basses. A quieter section follows: several instrumental solos build up the texture (notably Alto Flute, Bass Clarinet and Marimba).  The work concludes by re-using the longer melodies, but now underneath the loud and dense texture.  The images of a rushing river flow through the piece, from the delicate opening  music to the violent rolling and tumbling of the fast section. The calm quiet waters of the instrumental solos give way to the final climax.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The idea of diffractions is represented in sound by the piano, central and prominent, exploiting an aspect of its technique to which it is ideally suited: rapid changes of direction and wide intervallic leaps with extreme dynamics. The orchestra provides bands of coloured spectra forming an integrated texture. The melody, oscillating and colourful is sometimes pointillistic and at other times it flows into longer continuous phrases. 'Diffractions' is essentially an abstract work in one continuous movement. 'Diffractions' was commissioned by the Dunedin Sinfonia (now called the Southern Sinfonia) with assistance from the Queen Elizabeth 11 Arts Council of New Zealand in December 1986, and was given its premiere performance by that orchestra conducted by Jack Speirs on September 13th 1987 with Terence Dennis as soloist. 'Diffractions' was performed at the 1987 \"Sonic Circus\" on October 31st by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra (NZSO) conducted by Francisco Feliciano with David Guerin as soloist. This performance was recorded by Radio New Zealand and broadcast on their Concert FM station. A performance of 'Diffractions' was given at the Nelson School of Music (NZ) by the Nelson Symphony Orchestra in April 1990 (Conductor: Miranda Adams with David Guerin as soloist).

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Manukau Refrains' is a delicate, colourful piece for 3 percussionists and community orchestra inspired by images of wading birds ('manukau'), shifting patterns of water and sand in an environment teeming with life. In performance, the percussionists are spaced apart with the timpani in their usual position at the rear of the orchestra and the marimba and vibraphone in front of the orchestra. Each percussionist also plays a variety of small non-tuned instruments such as guiros, small drums and Pacific log drums. After a soft introduction, the 'refrain' begins as a short rhythmic pattern played by the timpani and is extended on each of its repetitions. Gradually instruments from the orchestra are drawn into this activity which accelerates as the piece progresses. The music builds to a climax followed by a short coda which reminisces on the mood of the opening. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Hanging Bulb was commissioned by The Dunedin Sinfonia while the composer was Mozart Fellow at Otago University.   It consists of a continuous movement, divided into four sections: slow, fast, slow, fast.  Sections 1 and 2 are thematically related, as are sections 3 and 4, so the structure could be described as a double couplet.   The work expresses particular emotional and psychological states of mind, encapsulated in the title of the work which is an image of despair.  Hanging light bulbs have been associated with despair and obsession in the world of art and in the real world.  They became a significant image to the composer at the time of writing this piece, which was not born in happy circumstances. Tension in the music is created through extensive use of the octatonic scale, bi-modal effects and thickly layered chords (such as occur near the end).  The xylophone and bass drum are used as symbols of cruelty, while the piano has an important 'personal'statement in the first section.  The last section has an obsessional quality which is expressed through repeated rhythms and motifs.   A music resource for secondary schools is available for this work from SOUNZ.

Encountering these sculptures in the British Museum for the first time, I was intrigued to learn that one of the decorative motifs adorning its carved stone form was known as �egg and tongue�. The sensuously rounded forms of eggs and tongues alternate and repeat along the borders of the monumental sculptures, an ancient pattern combining symbols of virility and fertility. The motif is widespread: several years later, walking through the ruined architecture of the Syrian city of Apamea, I found tumbled-down stones of Roman structures bearing this same pattern, rain-washed stones in a field of crocuses.  In the music of �Egg and Tongue�, I play with ideas of patterning and fragmentation, cultural property and style. Familiar motifs repeat, adorn, are lost and take new shapes.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In January 1992 the Queensland Wind Soloists requested a short piece using Australian folksongs to be played as an encore number during their coming tour of Canada. The result was this work based on three tunes: the traditional 'Waltzing Matilda', the Queensland version of the same, and 'Click go the Shears'. To the composer's pleasant surprise all three fitted together, as they do in the final section of the music.  The work begins with a somewhat �drunken� phrase from 'Waltzing Matilda' (to the 'amusement' of the players) before breaking into a traditional setting of the tune. Each folk-tune gets its share of the limelight. Short interludes of untraditional chords provide some contrast in this light-hearted composition for wind octet.    Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

It was written for my sister, Joyce Whitehead, to play at thr Registered Music Teachers' Conference in Auckland that year. A series of seven short piano pieces, written with children in mind (although some of them are difficult for children to play), was written for my godson, Kit Boyes. There is little to say about the pieces themselves except that the last repeats the first, the third has to do with birdsong, the fifth with the wind, and the sixth consists of nine ideas that the pianist plays in whatever sequence she or he wishes.

The poem that Jenny provided was exciting, accessible and quite humorous.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: When I was asked to conduct Pakuranga Choral Society in their first concert for 2005, the question of suitable repertoire was discussed with the choir management. We decided that the concert need not be a major oratorio, and I suggested a programme of Bach (�Cantata No. 140�) and Haydn (�Nelson Mass�) with an offer to write something new to complement these works. I was also keen to use one of my ex-students, Morag Atchison, as the soprano soloist in the concert. My work therefore became a piece which would feature her voice, with not too heavy demands on the choir. The texts I finally selected were all on the theme of night, and form a cycle of pieces. The first text, �Night Countdown� by Peggy Dunstan, describes some of the many sights and sounds of the night, but contrasting that with �...only one moon and one me�. The second text is a lullaby: �Rocking my Baby� by Wendy Orr. The third text, �The Middle of the Night� by Karla Kuskin, describes someone, probably a child, lying awake and listening to the sounds of the night. There are strange noises, and the lights go out one by one. The prospect of nightmares is not far away, so you hide under your pillow and shut your eyes. Then you sing to yourself a confidence-boosting song about how you love the middle of the night and all its noises and weird animals � this part of the poem is sung by the choir. The fourth piece sees me returning to the poetry of American Jack Prelutsky and �The Dance of the Thirteen Skeletons�. Here we do have a nightmare � thirteen skeletons dancing around a snowy graveyard! Here, the choir sings the chorus which describes the noises the skeletons make, and the accompaniment makes passing references to the well-known �Danse Macabre� by Saint Sa�ns. The final piece is appropriately titled �Last Song�, by James Guthrie. This short poem is a brief �good night� wish. �Night Visions� was first performed on 22nd May 2005 by Morag Atchison (soprano) with Pakuranga Choral Society, conducted by the composer. The orchestrated version was made in 2006 for a concert by Auckland Choral.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The piece was first played at their wonderful home near Queenstown, on the occasion of Pat's birthday.  It was written for a quartet then resident at the University of Otago Music department.   The piece is in a single movement.  Slower sections at the beginning and end surround a main quick section.  The piece evokes the mountain landscape around Queenstown, and also Morgan and Pat's place, which is called 'Whakatipua'.  There are elements of folk music in the piece which is characterised by open-sounding sonorities.  It is reasonably challenging for the players without being too demanding.

The title, combining two Maori words, �Matai� meaning �sea� and �Rangi� meaning �sky�, is an original name for one of Wellington�s more prominent hills, Mount Victoria. �Matairangi - 1� was commissioned by Chamber Music New Zealand for James Bush and Sarah Watkins to premiere in 1996, and the funds for the commission were provided by Creative New Zealand Toi Aotearoa.  ��Matairangi - 1�was recorded for the CD �Matairangi - Helen Fisher Chamber Music� which is available at SOUNZ, the Centre for New Zealand Music. The work is dedicated to Joan Henderson, Helen Fisher�s cousin. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Organ Overture' was commissioned by the Southern Sinfonia to celebrate the orchestra's 40th anniversary. It was written and funded as part of the composer's work at the University of Otago. It features a prominent part for concert organ, and is also partly a tribute to 'Norma', the Dunedin Town Hall organ. Orchestras often bring together many threads of a musical community, and are a vital part of the culture in New Zealand cities. The diversity of instruments and musicians on display in an orchestra are a great source of inspiration for composers and music-followers alike. In this overture I give thanks to the Sinfonia, and wish it a long and happy future. Elements of southern weather find their way into the music. The piece opens stormily, with jagged lightning and rumbling thunder. A vigorous theme emerges and leads to a gusty, pulsating passage. As this calms a little, a drum rhythm appears. Following a flowing melody on strings, accompanied by the organ, the percussion rhythm battles with rest of the orchestra. This leads to a fugue on the woodwinds, based on the opening melody. The organ then takes over with a brief cadenza, leading to a rhythmic coda in which the main themes are summarised. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This commission from Holy Trinity Cathedral (Auckland) was instigated by the Director of Music Peter Watts, and was described as �a gift to the people of New Zealand from Holy Trinity Cathedral�. The project description further stated: \"The New Zealand Prayer Book contains many liturgies which we adapt in various ways to suit music composed over the past 400 years � mostly English composers with a few New Zealanders represented � Mews, Griffiths, Dienes and Jennings. We would like to invite leading New Zealand composer, David Hamilton, in consultation with the Director of Music, to write a set of music specifically for the new liturgies, that could be sung either simply by the congregation with organ or piano accompaniment, or in a more complex style by church and cathedral choirs combining with the congregation.\" The intention was that the music should be accessible and able to be used as widely as possible, even by congregations of other denominations. The music is scored for brass and organ, but also performable with just piano or organ accompaniment. The vocal parts are designed to be performable just by congregation, or incorporating a choir. The first set of music was performed on Easter Sunday 2000 in the morning service at Holy Trinity Cathedral. A second set of pieces, completed in mid-2002, consists of texts selected from alternative services within the New Zealand Prayer Book.  This millennium project was funded by the NZ Lottery Grants Board. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

A poem caught my ear and lulled me with its rhythm: lilting and stalling, flowing and overflowing the bounds of the line. Just as there are an infinite number of readers, so are there infinite ways of reading a poem. I wanted to capture these subtle variations of interpretation. The words which constitute poetry can be simple and familiar, but new meanings jump out unexpectedly from one reading to the next. I imagined a piece of music which travelled with the reader: pressing forward, pausing, repeating, circling back�a process of rereading in which certain images start to resound, gaining clarity with each recurrence. Poetry doesn't reveal itself on the first reading. It is not until we reach the end of the music that we begin to understand what captivates us.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The work is a comment on the period of time between the often picturesque part of the day when the sun sets and the stars begin to shine. In southern regions of New Zealand this part of the day is called twilight and is defined as the time between sunset and darkness. Twilight can also mean the period of time when life begins to draw to a close.  When twilight is referred to in the context of a day it may have a joyous meaning, but when associated with the penultimate stage of a life cycle it can bring sorrow. This work was written in memory of a dear friend who was drowned on January 2nd, 1994. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: At certain times in life one feels the need to do or create something flashy. My Epicycle for string quartet of 1989 is one such piece, and my 'Three Rhythmics' for piano duet another. But virtuosity comes with a price � the work was rejected by the two pianists for whom it was first written, and has been a cause for complaint by the several duo pianists who have tackled it since. Indeed the style of virtuosity explored here is mechanistic, rather than Lisztian, and perhaps I am justified in presenting here a computer version as a kind of �model� performance; the last movement is labelled �Nancarrowesque� and perhaps that is the apt precedent to cite! But the several, albeit imperfect, live performances that I have heard have always been exhilarating; and so, perhaps, its demands do, after all, produce rewards�. The first movement of this piano duet alternates between double handed tremolando and repeated rhythmic cells that change relationship to each other, with some hand-clapping thrown in for good measure. A short interlude begins with a free, parlando style that gradually transforms itself into a metrical rhythm. The last movement pits the two performers against each other in an unstoppable flood of sound. Three Rhythmics, commissioned by the Music Federation of New Zealand, was premiered by Diane Cooper and Dan Poynton. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Much of the surface of this piece inhabits an area on the brink of silence.  This is an extremely unsafe are for the performer, because he or she constantly risks losing the sound altogether.  It is hoped that the soft dynamic levels focus the listener's attention on the microscopic shifts in timbre, pitch and loudness that are the central material of the composition. Below the surface, rather than employing an overall unifying structure/process, several processes are active simultaneously, and much of the composition is the result of these processes tearing at each other while competing for priorty.  There is an \"organic\" process of growth, that conditions the placement of events in time, as well as the pitch and timbral relationships between these events.  Superimposed on this structure is a spectral analysis of the title of the piece, taken from Ezra Pound's \"Cantos\", which also impacts on the placement of events and their internal shape, effectively \"damaging\" the underlying organic organisation.  The third main layer relates to pitch organisation and is based on an analysis of Edgard Varese's \"Density 21.5\".  This layer is of particular importance for the \"grace note\" figures that abound, figures which exist \"outside\" the main body of the composition, but give important structural clues relating to both the first and second processes mentioned above. \"And, out of nothing, a breathing, hot breath on my ankles\" was written for, and is dedicated to Ales Kacjan.

This work attempts to recreate the feeling and emotions of Antarctica, starting with a massive eruption of sound in the opening two bars, the energy of which subsides slowly into a peaceful world of subtle, pale colour. In Antarctica one feels as if one is experiencing the aftermath of huge disruption, of massive forces, which have come together in awesome strength but have now settled and become (temporarily) covered in a soothing blanket of white.  Of course, there is nothing soothing about this blanket - it comprises layer upon layer of ice, continually in a state of flux as the massive ice sheets move under the enormous strain.  Antarctica is peaceful and energetic, beautiful and brutal, empty and yet eerily full.  This work attempts to draw some of these ideas together and to capture a part of the essence that is the earth's last true great wilderness.  I am indebted to Antarctica New Zealand for the opportunity to travel to Antarctica and gain the inspiration essential for the creation of my work. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Each of the songs is a celebration: the first of the silent singing of children sculpted in stone; the second of kite-flying; the third a hymn to God and nature; the fourth a love-song from the muddy trenches of World War 1; and the last one of Cummings' many songs of the joys of Spring.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In New Zealand there has been a reluctance on the part of pakeha men to move to music.  Perhaps it is our Victorian background that makes us feel silly and self-conscious when dancing.  We pefer to sit back and be still, like the Tuatara.  In this piece, the old reptile (Tuatara) shakes off his passive past and moves to some more contemporary-sounding dance rhythms.   The work is in a continous movement, divided into several sections. It opens with an ironical glance at the atonal past before flicking it away, like a fly.  A jaunty 'Tuatara' theme is played on clarinet over bass ostinati, leading to a more vibrant and lively theme.   While the first section is earthy and physical in character, the second is a fantasy, full of ethereal images.  The initial delicate waltz theme develops and grows into a more menacing idea, before fading back into the 'Tuatara' theme.   The rest of the piece comprises various dances that adopt certain styles: jazz, folky, rock.  A gypsy-like theme combines with a version of 'God Defend NZ' in a section where pakeha men are on their feet! The finale uses log drum and Pacific Island rhythms to bring the piece to an exciting conclusion.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: was born in Christchurch and lived the first 27 years of my life there.  For most of those years I had no knowledge of Ngai Tahu or their history. I became fascinated by Maori beliefs during inspiring Religious Studies lectures given by Jim Wilson at Canterbury University, and launched into my own study of Maori music.  But for all that, I had no real awareness of southern Maori.  It is only recently that I have learned to say: 'Tena koutou katoa. Ko Anthony toku ingoa, ko John toku papa, ko Anita toku mama, ko Simon toku tungane, ko Judy ratou ko Jenny ko Liz oku tuahine, ko Sandy toku wahine, ko Tristan aku tama, ko Annabelle oku tamahine, No Otetahi ahau, Na reira, tena koutou katoa.'   It was tremendously exciting, therefore, to be asked to write music for a work celebrating the anniversary of the arrival of the settlers in Otetahi.  Here was a chance to be involved in an exploration of the distant past: Ngai Tahu's own arrival in the South Island, pre-dating the English settlers by many years.  Reading Te Maire Tau's account of Moki's life and the surrounding history opened up a whole new world to me.  This was history full of conflict and struggle, passions and rivalry, and an inspiring source for a composer.   Another exciting dimension for me was collaborating with Keri Hulme.  I have long admired her writing since reading The Bone People back in the late 1980s, and setting her poem He Moemoea to music.  To be honest, I wondered how Keri was going to condense such a complex history into a libretto.  Her solution, to have Moki on his last day on earth remembering back over the significant events in his life, was ingenious and worked very well in terms of the musical genre.   Much of the music is concerned with characterisation.  The forceful and head-strong character of Moki is depicted by the orchestra early on.  He is a man of action, brave and capricious; much of the life-force of the music comes from his mana, resulting in plenty of driving rhythms. On the other hand, he can be sensitive as in his duet with Marewa, singing to their sleeping daughter.  Moki's arrogance lands him in trouble with two chiefly sisters, who he has slept with.  His foolish boasting is reprimanded by the chorus in 'The Words are loosed', where the insults are repeated for everyone to hear.   The orchestra and choir is sometimes used to colour the images in the story.  Following the Karanga near the beginning, for instance, we hear the choir announce the rising of the sun, accompanied by blazing brass and cymbals.  In Moki's opening song, the 'thin line of light illuminating the islands from the north to the south' is portrayed by florid lines on flutes, harp and celesta.   One of the interesting challenges in Ahua was to combine my music with music by Te Ari's Kapa haka group.  This was made more difficult by distance: at present I live in Dunedin!  There is a also a big difference between Classical music and Maori music, but it is interesting and worthwhile to discover things in common, and to celebrate the differences. I want to acknowledge my collaboration with Te Ari and Te Maire as regards the music for Ahua and thank them for their input.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The notion of \"form as a product of growth\" was central to the process of composing 'kontinuum 1'.  A network of interrelated material is evolved from a single cell and it is the subsequent linking, overlapping and extending of this material generates the piece's thirteen short movements.  Thus, rather than seeking contrast, all thirteen movements explore the same ideas, as if viewing the same object from many different angles. It is hoped that each movement has a very clear exterior shape which can be easily apprehended by the listener on first hearing the work.  Within this is an interior containing sonic events that are extremely detailed, both in their make up and in their relationships to one another. 'kontinuum 1' was composed for, and is dedicated to, the Zagreb Saxophone Quartet.  It was commissioned with the assistance of the QEII Arts Council of New Zealand and the New Zealand Composers' Foundation. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

In attempting to marry the two instruments, the piece inevitably borrows bits from Indian music: the drone, the modal approach and the association of drumming with sitar-playing (though the \"drummer\" here is the guitarist).  It remains however, basically western in concept: it is fully notated, the mode is Messiaen's mode 2, and the sitarist is required to stop the tonic drone during the middle section of the piece allowing the guitarist to provide three substitute chords - in other words, \"modulation\"!

The Piece received it's one only public performance in the Wellington Town Hall that year, with Michael Houston conducting. This performance was later broadcast on Concert Programme. The Title refers to a 'Riff' - an ostinato played over changing harmonies in jazz and rock music. 'No Riff' therefore should imply there are no riffs in the music however to the contrary, the work is totally based on a riff, which we hear from the start. Therefore the title is misleading and mischievous. I can recall that I was very interested at the time, in creating a piece of orchestral music with a strong clear musical structure. 'No Riff' started as a piece I first preformed extensively with my Trio 'Triphonics'.  Therefore I knew that the compositional form 'worked well' and this allowed me to focus on creating the orchestration. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Recently my curiosity was sparked as to the origins of Maori action songs � a hybrid form combining traditional movements, borrowed Western melodies and Maori lyrics. It seems that I owe my encounter with them to an enthusiastic physical education specialist in the late 1940�s who introduced them into the public school system along with Maori childrens games, noting that they were �exceedingly good for the body of the pakeha� (non-Maori).   W is for is my response to that early time spent dancing and singing in a language which we were never taught to speak. The text is an excerpt from a Maori-English dictionary. It begins at waka (canoe) and passes through wakainga (true home, far distant home) and warawara (yearning), arriving finally at wareware � forget, forgotten, forgetful. The final line comes from the Belgian singer Jacques Brel�s ballad �On n�oublie rien� � you forget nothing.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

A network of interrelated material is evolved from a single cell and it is the subsequent linking, overlapping and extending of this material that generates the piece's final form. \"kontinuum 2\" was composed for, and is dedicated to, Slovene violinst Branko Brezavscek.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: SYNOPSIS Scene 1 opens to show a room in a house overlooking a river, which is partly visible through half-drawn curtains. Mrs Green and a man bring in and leave Bailey, who sings of his frustration at being confined to this room because of his infirmity. He finds that ordinary pastimes cannot alleviate the tedium, and we leave him pondering the coming days and weeks. Scene 2 starts with Bailey in much the same dejected mood as in the previous scene, except now his desperation is rising. Mrs Green is in taking out breakfast dishes and on her way out opens the curtains completely. Suddenly a new world opens up to Bailey. Vessels of all shapes and sizes pass by and give him great entertainment to watch. He rejoices in the pleasure that this simple activity affords him. In Scene 3, we see Bailey cheering a scene he is watching pass by. He comments that this diversion, which he once would have scorned, has been a lifesaver. He gets frustrated and impatient when nothing is happening, but hopes that one day he will get to see something exciting - a boat sinking, a rescue party and someone hauled out with a boat hook. Then the launch belonging to Fitzgibbon, a neighbour, who moves into view. This he recognises instantly. Bailey notices that the dark-skinned (Malayan) servants are behaving oddly. One swaggers with a boat hook, the other just sits and watches the water trail away astern. He comments that this is an unwise behaviour, to be always watching the water like that. The boat moves on. Bailey now ponders the lives of those he watches through his window. They are from all over the world, and gather to pass in front of his window, seemingly to entertain him. He recalls the one particular occasion when a man rowed into view, had caught something, got into difficulty momentarily, and then went on again. Bailey may never see that man again, and as far as it concerns him, he may have lived his whole life to be sport for Bailey to watch for just a few seconds. When Scene 4 opens, we see Bailey and the river on an uneventful day. Suddenly Bailey sees something in the distance in the fields on the far side of the river. He make out a man running his way, and it turns out to be one of the Malay servants of Fitzgibbon. A shot is fired, and Bailey realises that a manhunt is afoot. The man runs into our view, and then disappears downstream. Nothing more appears to be happening, when a commotion is heard from where the man has run, and he reappears, followed by a new set of pursuers. They chase him back upstream, just as the first party of chasers arrives. Fitzgibbon is among them, and they follow. The hunted man dives into the river and is once again hidden from view. All seems ms quiet, and Bailey laments not seeing the conclusion of the events. Suddenly Mrs Green arrives and is hysterical. Bailey is eager to know what she has to tell, but is disappointed with what she has to say. She was coming through the woods completely unaware of the fugitive's presence, and only knew when she me met Fitzgibbon that anything was happening. She has been overcome me by her vulnerability. This disappoints Bailey, hoping for something far more interesting, Mrs Green chases perhaps. He asks her to get him something to eat, but in the middle of her protestations, something is in the tree outside the window. The fugitive climbs on to the deck and then into the window. Both Bailey and Mrs Green are helpless. A shot rings out, and the man collapses on to Bailey's legs and dies. The party of men come in, comfort Mrs Green and start to clear away the body and debris. Fitzgibbon, with the rifle, did not really mean to kill the ma man, but Bailey is glad that he did. The scene darkens with Bailey, with the tiniest of grins on his face, staring at where the body had been. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work began as an exercise in the use of L-Systems as a compositional tool, inspired by Hanspeter Kyburz�s Cells and Michael Norris� research into methods of using these patterns. L- Systems are algorithms designed by the biologist Aristid Lindenmayer to imitate natural processes of growth and decay and can be musically interpreted in various ways.   Three different L-Systems were used for this work; the example on the following page is that of the first movement. Here, and similarly in the third movement, each letter of the pattern was substituted with a different musical gesture. Using gesture rather than specific motifs allowed more compositional freedom to develop ideas while working within the set pattern. In order to create a more lyrical second movement, I experimented with substituting pitch class sets to the pattern, rather than gestures. As a result, the musical growth that is evident in the other movements is not so clear.  No mathematical system can be adhered to precisely without a loss of musicality, hence the L-systems I used quickly became macrostructural. These patterns also reach a point where there is too much self-similarity and they must be abandoned in favour of musical intuition.      The title refers to the Fibonacci series. Many L-systems (although not the following example!) bear a relationship to this in the length of each new generation. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: �Leise Rieselt der Schnee� uses as a starting point the Austrian carol of that name.  The piece is a kind of homage to Austrian folk music, which is so pure in its simplest forms, and which has had such a wide influence through the music of classical composers.  I have also used other music which is still sung in the alps, as well as some �jodlers� of my own: the plainchant, �Christ ist erstanden�, �Innsbruck, ich muss dich lassen�, by Isaac, �Verlassen bin i�, in Alpine dialect, and the �Andachtsjodler�, which is traditionally sung at Christmas.  I also used a few bars of Mozart�s clarinet quintet, which is very like the �Andachtsjodler�, because the spirit of Alpine folk music is very much alive in his music. �Leise Rieselt der Schnee� was written for the Sydney University Musical Society.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: These pieces utilise Abelian form, a concept I developed whereby the proportions of a large form were reflected in its constituent parts.  A large form, for instance, has sections A, B, C, D, and E, with respective durations t1, t2, t3, t4, t5.  A, B, C, D, E also have subsections whose proportions are also t1, t2, t3, t4, t5.  We can designate the subsections of A as Aa, Ab, Ac, Ad and Ae, and similarly for the others.  The whole process can be shown in the following table: Aa    Ab    Ac    Ad    Ae Ba    Bb    Bc    Bd    Be Ca    Cb    Cc    Cd    Ce Da   Db    Dc    Dd    De      Ea    Eb    Ec    Ed    Ee This looks like a mathematical Abelian Group - hence the name.  The durations of subsections symmetrically placed about the leading diagonal (Aa, Bb, Cc, Dd and Ee) are also equal because duration of Ab = duration of Ba, duration of Ac =  duration of Ca, etc.  This fact led me to use the same material in matching subsections, often mirrored. In PIANO POEMS 1, 4, 8 and 9 I use this form; although the proportions are all equal, the Abelian shape determines the order. 1 Abelian form (3 X 3 matrix) with overlaps 2 a mirror piece 3 a chance piece: the contents of the four different chords and thir order and the interruptions by the fist rolls were all determined by chance 4 Abelian form (4 X 4 matrix): all sections are four bars long.  Subsection Ab is the mirror of subsection Bb, etc 5 Free form 6 Bogen form: A, B, C, C', B', A', where A' is the augmentation of A, etc 7 Free variations on a short melody 8 Abelian form (3 X 3 matrix): all reptitions are shortened 9 Abelian form (4 X 4 matrix) using fragments from sections 1 to 8  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: \"Rakiura is the Maori name for Stewart Island - the Land of the Glowing Sky. The island lies to the far south of New Zealand. It is separated from the mainland of the South Island by Foveaux Strait. It is rugged, remote, bushclad, and very beautiful.\" (from the 'Author's note' by Eileen Philipp in the published play script \"Rakiura\"). \"Rakiura\" is the name of a play by Eileen Philipp. It retells, in the style of a Japanese Noh play, the true story of a Japanese woman found living in a cave on Stewart Island in the late 1970's. The woman had no coherent reason for being there, simply that she had had an obsessive need to travel far from Japan. Eventually convicted as an overstayer, she was escorted back to Japan by relatives. The play incorporates many of the stylized features of Noh drama including a chorus which comments on the action. My setting of parts of the text in no way tries to re-tell the narrative. Instead, I selected parts of the text which speak mainly of the landscape. In doing so, I have taken several liberties: the selected texts are presented here as though a single entity, whereas they come from various places in the play. Also, I have allocated the texts to choir or the alto solo according to structural or musical needs, rather than trying to retain the solo/chorus divisions of the original. The music oscillates between E minor and G minor harmonic centres. It is often quite static although there are two major climax points. Structurally the work is something of an arch, with the opening musical ideas returning at the end. \"Rakiura\" was commissioned by the Auckland Dorian Choir (conductor: Karen Grylls) with funding provided by the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council whose assistance is gratefully acknowledged.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Gallipoli' was composed in memory of the World War I battle that took place between Turkey and Anzacs, symbolizing as a whole, the mutual good relations of the countries of Turkey, Australia and New Zealand, which are in friendly relations in our day. The message given by Turkey's leader Atat�rk after the war was one of humanism and friendship. This is still commemorated by both the ANZACs and the Turks with great importance every year. This work was premi�red on 16 May 2003 by the Turkish State Symphony Orchestra of Bursa with Turkey's renowned trumpeter Erden Bilgen as soloist and conducted by the composer.   The idea of writing this solo work for trumpet was born when Erden Bilgen met the composer in Auckland.  It became formalized with the composer's visit to Gallipoli in 2001 and a subsequent meeting between the two in Istanbul.  Written in Rhapsodic form in one movement, the music is not intended to interpret the horrors and negative aspects of war, but more the emotions and reflective times of the young ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corp.) and Turkish troops summoned to war on Turkish ground.  The opening trumpet fanfare is the call to war. In the middle section the composer uses a traditional folk theme from the Turkish region of Canakkale.  There is a short cadenza and the orchestration requires a large symphony orchestra. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  general_note: ""
  internal_note: "Programme Note: The composition of the 'Serenade for Strings' was undertaken from 2001 and this work succeeds Nigel Keay's 'Viola Concerto'. The 'Serenade' is a four movement work of around 17 minutes duration in an essentially lyrical style. The initial inspiration for the 'Serenade for String Orchestra' came from being involved as a violist in a string orchestra in Caen, Lower Normandy, which was assembling a programme of String Serenades. 'Serenade for Strings' is dedicated to Val�rie Baisn�e who played violin in this group. From June 2001, work continued on the second movement in Paris and the writing was eventually finished in 2002. The first movement ('Moderato') starts very simply, which represents a tabula rasa where the lines accumulate one by one to construct the harmony, a detachment from what had been the heavy task of writing the 'Viola Concerto'. 'Serenade for Strings' starts from nothing to create new harmonies. Concerning the idea of the serenade, today a very imprecise musical form, the idea of the evening or night is kept through using a musical language that is quite dark. The first movement is based on a short, recurring chromatic melody constructed of quavers, but which is surrounded by a more and more elaborate variation of the background material. The second movement ('Allegro') is constructed on a kind of moto perpetuo texture long interwoven lines, which evolve into increasingly ornamented and elaborate melodies. The third movement ('Adagietto') is the darkest movement, marked by an often low orchestral tessitura. The bare melodies create the most desperate and tender moments of this work. The fourth movement ('Vivo') makes a lively contrast to the third with an optimistic opening. Melodic motives are tossed around the orchestra as in a game. But towards the end the nostalgic themes of the first movement are recalled. � Comme tu me plairais, � nuit ! sans ces �toiles Dont la lumi�re parle un langage connu ! Car je cherche le vide, et le noir, et le nu ! � Baudelaire   'Obsession' Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

This work is in three movements (quick � slow � quick), but these are connected by cadenza-like links for the guitar soloist, so that the music is continuous. In view of the balance problems in a guitar concerto I have written for a small orchestra (flute, oboe, clarinet, horn, percussion and strings), and treated the relationship between solo and orchestra in a concertante style � sharing material rather than opposing each other, and aiming throughout to make the guitar easily audible. Dance rhythms, with touches of rhumba and jazz, predominate in the quick movements, while the slow central movement uses variable speed tremolo on the guitar to enhance its singing qualities.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The title of this work may seem unexpected as there is no �Concert Grosso No. 1� in my list of works! However I�ve always considered my 1985 work for strings and percussion �Well Done, Mister Bach� to be a concerto grosso. That work features the leaders of all five string parts as a �concertante� group. In a more traditional Baroque manner, this work features just the leaders of the first and second violin and cello sections as the soloists. My intention with the work was to write something in the manner of a Baroque concerto grosso, drawing inspiration from typical styles of the period. Mixed in are my own musical and compositional preferences, so that in the end the piece might be described as �Baroque meets minimalism�. I finally gave into the temptation to give the three movements titles. The title, �Prelude�, of the first movement is a little ironic as it is longer than the remaining two movements combined. The second movement, �Air on a Shoestring� suggests a rather brief, perhaps truncated, air � in this case, a piece which fails to return to its home key. The final movement is in the manner of a Baroque fugue � I knew that university paper would finally come in useful one day!. �Concert Grosso No. 2� was commissioned by the Music Department of St Cuthbert�s College in Auckland, and follows a commission from them the previous year for �Whisper to me� (for choir, strings and percussion).

  internal_note: "Programme Note: \"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\" Ludwig Wittgenstein Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus The inside of the piano provides a unique acoustic space with particular resonant qualities.  'throwing the ladder away' attempts to explore the character of this acoustic space, especially the subtle transition between sound and silence that results when resonating strings are allowed to decay naturally (ie, without dampers being applied to the strings). As well as \"repositories\" for resonance, the extended silences near the beginning of the piece are also important structurally, playing on the relationship between perceptual activity (or inactivity) and our cognition of the passing (or accumulation) of time.  Thorughout the piece the use of the vertical pitch space is carefully controlled so as to leave a distinct \"spatial\" impression that is somehow \"folded into\" the temporal aspect. 'throwing the ladder away' was composed for, and is dedicated to, Bojan Gorisek.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Trio for Clarinet, Cello and Piano was composed in 1988 while the composer was Mozart Fellow at Otago University.  It was composed for Peter Adams (clarinet) and Judith Williams (cello) to play, along with the composer at the piano.  The first performance took place in 1989, and the same ensemble recorded the work for radio later that year.   This work straddles a stylistic change in the composer's output.  The first and second movements still show the influence of Bartok, a composer Ritchie had studied for his Ph.D earlier in the 1980s.  In the third movement, however, he experiments with minimalist techniques which he had become interested in during the year as Mozart Fellow.   The first movement has a slow introduction, presenting an important motif which is developed in the faster main section that follows.  A more lyrical secondary theme contrasts with the jerky first theme presented by the clarinet, and both themes are combined in the middle section.   The cello plays a brooding theme over an ostinato, at the start of the second movement.  It is decorated by the clarinet and the music builds to a powerful and sustained variation of the theme.  In the middle, the angst is replaced by drifting, dreamy textures before the main theme returns.  However, it becomes transformed by the dreamy texture at the end.   A simple modal idea unfolds at the start of the finale and is developed throughout the movement in various different ways.  The impetus of the music grows and it bursts into compund time in the middle section.  When the piano becomes 'stuck' on a persistent figure the main theme returns and gradually grows into a broader and more lyrical statement.  Following the climax the music quietly runs out of steam and stops.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Whether computer failures will cause a slight inconvenience or be a major disruption to life seems largely a matter for conjecture.  However, I find the escalating alarm (sometimes exacerbated by scaremongers) and often ensuing bizarre reactions a fascinating aspect of our psychological makeup.  The main idea behind the work is a measured increase in tempo which culminates in some frenetic activity.  The musical texture incorporates ordinary scalic movement and has been derived from a simple octatonic scale.  (The computer on which I wrote this work is 'year 2000 compliant' !)  I would like to thank the Auckland Philharmonia for the opportunity to write \"Y2k Pacemaker\" and have long admired the orchestra's commitment to New Zealand music.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In his 1974 collection 'The lives of a Cell', Lewis Thomas wrote a memorable essay devoted to the spectrum of sound made by all living creatures. He believes that as well as producing sounds in every possible way to send messages to their own kind, all creatures have the urge to make some kind of music. The rhythmic sounds         emitted by all creatures might, Lewis suggests �be the recapitulation of something else - an earliest memory, a score for the transformation of inanimate random matter in chaos into the improbable ordered dance of living forms.� It was this essay, together with my fascination in the rediscovery of the part of Auckland I knew as a young child, that have shaped this piece. The basis of the piece is the twelve possible three-note groups which function to form molecular structures - harmonic, textural, gestural, melodic - some simple, some complex, often symmetrical.  The piece could be regarded as part of a classical tradition, in that it focuses primarily on balance of pitch and orchestration rather than on gesture or programmatic elements, and places the instrumental writing well within the range of the instruments rather than exploiting their extremes.  'The improbable ordered dance ----' is in a single movement and begins with a ghostly chant-like melody over a drone; this recurs in different forms several times during the piece. A transition section based on transformed sounds of nocturnal birds leads to a metrically free 'dawn chorus'. The following chorale-like passages and the rapid sections that follow are part of a restless upward-moving continuum which can never settle nor ever finish. The later sections of the piece recycle, combine and finally dissipate the earlier material. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Chromatic textures reflect wind and surf, swirling, then pause for breath before hurtling off again, intentionally avoiding metered structures. Harris has always viewed the work as a �New Zealand piece�, although commentators from the period labelled it as belonging to the European art music tradition. The artist�s response: �I was thinking about New Zealand things. Sea, wind��. David Guerin gave the first performance of 'Variation' in 1982, but the technical challenges of the work have meant that it has seen few performances since. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Scored for flute, clarinet, vibraphone/marimba, piano, violin, viola and cello, this piece was written for performance by members of the Stockhausen�s ensemble, including parts designed specifically for Aloys Kontarsky, Siegfried Palm, and Cristoph Caskel, who, at the time, were the world�s leading performers of contemporary music. To the composer it seemed unlikely the work could ever be played in New Zealand, although it is noteworthy that Douglas Lilburn chose this as the first score to publish under his newly founded Waiteata editions imprint, such was his admiration for the composer�s achievement. However, with growing numbers of skilled and committed performers in New Zealand, �For Seven� eventually received its New Zealand premiere in 1992, by the new music ensemble CadeNZa.  Since then it has had several other fine performances here, and well as others in Europe. Recognition of the work�s status within our musical canon can be judged from the simultaneous CD publication of two different versions of the work, one by the UK-based ensemble Lontano conducted by Odaline de la Martinez, and this present recording by Stroma. 'For Seven' was one of the first pieces to combine elements from the two major European schools of the time - the Eastern European cluster music, and the serialism of Boulez and Stockhausen. The piece consists of various lines of composed accelerandi and ritardandi, determined by a network of simple numerical ratios. These ratios also govern other aspects of the piece, such as the lengths of sections and the pitch intervals used. Combined with the highly structured �foreground� material is more amorphous �background� material (including some improvisatory elements), with frequent interaction between the two. Though the construction of the piece is complex, the result had a natural musicality and flow. McLeod has said that, although she was not conscious of it at the time of composition, she now hears clearly the influence of the sounds of the New Zealand bush. (Programme note: Mark Jones).

Realising that I had few suitable pieces, and that in fact there was little such music by NZ composers, I wrote this cycle. I tried to avoid texts with overtly northern hemisphere references such as snow and holly, although the second piece alludes to the food associated with English Christmases. The first piece sets a text by Elizabeth Fleming which tells of that first Christmas and some of the sights and sounds around it. The second text, by Elizabeth Gould, details the making of Christmas mincemeat. The final text, by Jane Yolen, tells of the trek of the wise men, but from the viewpoint of the camels. Musically the works are in simple tonal style, often suggesting folk music. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

While hoping to reconnect to a lost time and culture, the archaeologists succeeded in cracking several of the instruments. More careful study revealed that the flutes were tuned to �familiar� scales, enabling their former owners to play �perhaps even music�. A researcher then performed a Chinese folk tune, Little Cabbage, on one of the flutes. Xiao Bai Cai is the heartfelt lament of a child usurped by a stepmother and new stepbrother: �pale on the ground�, Little Cabbage weeps for the past.   With its mixture of carelessness, optimism and nostalgic yearning for times past, this story fascinates me. In 9,000 years time, what will other beings make of the crumbling remains of violins, flutes and double basses? 'Pale on the Ground' is an invented music built on the imagined ruins of our own fragile culture. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Dedicated to my father, who died in 1999, the requiem (in nomine patris) started off as an optimistic work, a celebration of life rather than as a morbid fixation on loss.  However, the reality of loss and the anger that comes with it soon began to take over the work.  It was only after several months of constant revision that any sense of lyricism began to shine through.   In the forefront of my mind were my friends Jenny Rowe, Patrick Beraud, Steve Johnson and Judi Pattinson, all bright lights no longer with us but whose spirits live on.  They, too, are in the tapestry of this work.  Anger at losing them is part of the work, as is deep unutterable sadness but the overriding sense (I hope) is of joy, typified by the uplifting Agnus Dei which concludes the work.  The 'Requiem' uses parts of the Latin mass interspersed with poetry by Emily Bronte, Walt Whitman, William Drummond, Kahlil Gibran and myself.  It is scored for soprano, tenor, choir and small chamber ensemble.  The instrumental ensemble provides the rhythmic and harmonic structure of the work but the main focus is the vocal material, the emotional crux of which is the Whitman setting  concluding the Recordare. The 'Requiem' combines plainsong motifs with dance elements, atonalism with minimalism and extended vocalising to present the requiem in a unique way - the ritual is still there but so is my personal comment on it. The requiem was written for the Jubilate Singers and their conductor John Pattinson and was premiered by them on 31st August 2001 in Christ Church Cathedral, Christchurch, New Zealand.

Rotating on its tower to constantly face the prevailing breeze and responding to wind force by setting thresholds for propeller speed, the nacelle is the brains of the operation.  'Nacelle' continues my exploration of metric modulation and its relation to the movement and behaviour of machines, though with the added element of a soloist, who steers the music's path through different tempi as well as defining the direction of the music's texture and language; the soloist is the brains of the operation. Two cadenzas allow for an escape from the rigours of the metric scheme, where a subjective take on the timing of proceedings is permitted.  In 2003 I lived close to Wellington's wind turbine and indulged in regular walks to the landmark. �Nacelle� was performed in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland by 175 East in April and May of 2003 with solo clarinetist Gretchen Dunsmore.

The listener can interpret the music in his or her own way.\" The first movement opens sonorously in the tonality of G, pulsating chords leading us inevitably to the first main theme, a theme that Ritchie himself characterises as a \"muscular, Bruknerian theme\", although the momentum that it engages owes more to Shostakovich. A sinuous saxophone theme is very significant in the central section, as is the lengthy oboe theme in the moderato section. The second movement opens with the sharp, bright sounds of oboes and clarinets accompanied by Cook Islands log drums. The log drum punctuates the movement's textures and creates a sense of propulsion. A light-hearted dance introduced by string quartet offers an opportunity for a change of mood. The third movement is a lament for the victims of the Bosnian wars. The highly evocative scoring of the opening pages was inpsired by the wailing of a Maori karanga, while tolling bells imbue this elegy with a special sense of tragedy. The symphony ends with a 'grand dance' which shows Ritchie has not been untouched by rock music. Several themes are brought together in an ecstatic coda, after which the music slowly unwinds over a reiterated pedal note. The opening of the first movement returns, and the final sound we hear is a single stroke on the tam tam. Symphony No.1 'Boum' was completed while Ritchie was Composer-in-residence with the Dunedin Sinfonia in 1993, and first performed the following year, under the baton of Sir William Southgate. It has recieved numerous performances, and was recorded for radio by the NZSO, in 1998, Auckland Philharmonia in 1996, Dunedin Sinfonia in 1994.  It is due for release on CD in 2007, with The Christchurch Symphony, and Kiwi Pacific Records.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Senryu - a Japanese poetic form similar to haiku \"An inquiry into the nature of man\". Associating a poetic form with this music concerns the regular balanced proportions of section lengths. This strict formal outline is articulated freely and intuitively.  A note on the metronome markings: The metronome markings are all defined by an increasing ration of 7:6. There is a 3/4 bar before each metronome change to give the proportional relationship leading to the new tempo. However each new tempo has been given a standard metronome mark which doesn't correspond exactly to the mathematically correct tempo. This means that each new tempo can be rehearsed separately with standard metronome markings. It is also an indication that the metronome markings do not have to be treated too dogmatically.  Suggestion for rehearsing:  Practise each section separately at the correct tempo and later negotiate the tempo modulations to link them together.  A matter of balance:  In Senyru instrumental balance should be related to the string pizzicatos. In almost all cases the pizz notes need to balance with bowed notes or piano notes. Thus,  the whole work will be relatively quiet but must still be intensely energetic! Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The water is also used in traditional and contemporary forms of blessing our young. The line waiora waimarama wairua refers to the life-giving force of the water, its clarity and purity, and the spiritual essence which pervades it and every life force. The second verse  focuses on the importance of generation after generation preserving all that is important: Te puna o te tangata refers to the fountain of humankind, that is, the womb which produces the future progeny of our people. From woman is born humankind � generations of people who continue to nurture and maintain those treasures passed down through eons of time: knowledge and wisdom, the importance of caring for others and looking after the environment. The final line, tamaiti taiohi taiao creates a link between the (tiny) infant, youth and the wider environment, and ultimately the Universe. The piece is devised so that it can be performed with or without the taonga puoro (koauau ponga ihu and koauau koiwi kuri). In the event that it is sung with the taonga, there can be considerable flexibility to allow the weaving of soloist and koauau. The koauau ponga ihu, used in the first verse, is a very quiet instrument, while the koauau koiwi kuri. Accidentals refer throughout the bar. Sometimes cautionary accidentals are used. In the sustained pedal sections, staggered breathing should be used to ensure continuity of sound. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

You�d be in deep stew, yes.� � Patti Labelle, Moon Shadow Listening to the Hammond-centred sound of the Peddlers in my parents� car in 1974, I'd feel positively queasy. Ransacking my Dad�s cassette collection a few years, I stumbled across some of this old �driving music�. Somehow I no longer felt nauseous when I listened to it. Around the same time I bought my brother a collection of Rare Groove for his 30th birthday. One of the stand-out tracks is of Patti Labelle singing her version of Cat Stevens� Moonshadow. The central section is an insanely long rant by Labelle in which each of the musicians solo (including a fabulous Hammond improv). Deep Stew takes it title and its spirit from this crazy sequence of �what if�s. Commissioned by the Composers� Association of New Zealand with funds from the QEII Arts Council, Deep Stew was premiered in 1994 at Wellington Town Hall, New Zealand. The Bang on a Can All-Stars gave the work its American premiere in 1995 at New York�s Lincoln Center. The current arrangement is a new revised version written especially for the California EAR Unit.

Now, 31 years later, and during the centenary celebrations of Shostakovich's birth, I have had the opportunity to write another dedication to the composer, courtesy of the Christchurch Symphony and Otago University (who funded the commission). When the idea of writing a piece based on a Shostakovich theme was first suggested, I immediately thought of a 'Theme and Variations'. However, I found it too difficult to settle on a single theme - there were so many good ones to choose from! This gave me the idea of basing the piece around more than one quotation from the composer's oeuvre. Shostakovich himself was fond of quoting other composers' works (and his own works also), as in the Eighth string quartet when the quotations form a string of coded messages. I decided to take this route, and ended up creating a piece that quotes Shostakovich 14 times. Some of these quotations are literal ones, while others are more disguised. Some are quite lengthy and form a structure to base the music around, while others are very short and fleeting. The Shostakovich of this piece is not the Shostakovich of the epic symphonies (although they have their place here). Instead, I use lesser-known early works as my starting point: those youthful, zany, cutting edge works that express an almost manic character on occasions. So the work opens with menace from the 'Fourth Symphony', followed by cheekiness from the 'Aphorisms' for piano, and satire from 'The Age of Gold' ballet. In amongst these are references to numerous other pieces, and particularly a deathly string chord from the '15th String Quartet'. They are brought together through free-association of ideas, and a few recurring motifs. The final section uses a theme from the 'Tenth Symphony', second movement, as the basis for a frenzied conclusion. When I wrote this piece I had in my mind the image of the crazed composer writing a sort of jumbled diary that lurches from farce to despair in rapid succession. Shostakovich was very fond of the 19th century Russian author Gogol, basing his first opera The Nose on one of Gogol's short stories. Another of Gogol's stories is 'Diary of a Madman', which uses the formula of 'laughter through tears', a formula that is very often present in Shostakovich, too. Therefore, my piece 'Diary of a Madman: Dedication to Shostakovich' is designed as a funny/sad commentary on a great composer who's music could induce both laughter and tears.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Works �en abyme� bear within themselves miniature reflections of themselves. The term �mise en abyme� was coined by Andre Gide and possibly came from the language of heraldry. The concept is found throughout literature and art, from the geometric paintings of Gordon Walters to the virtual worlds of 'eXistenZ'. The French word �abyme� (a variant spelling of �abime�) means �abyss�, suggesting ideas of depth, increasing velocity, descent, infinity, interiority, spiraling, vertigo� At a simple (literal) level these suggestions are manifested in this work in nested descending scales that increase in velocity and occurrence, though as material feeds back on itself these structural markers are increasingly obscured. The player, too, enters a kind of abyss as the work progresses and their control over the increasingly-diversifying material is put in jeopardy. 'en abyme' was commissioned by Mette Leroy as part of her Doctor of Musical Arts performance and thesis research, and was premi�red by Leroy, under the auspices of the Karlheinz Company, at the University of Auckland in May 2007.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Imagine the harmonics associated with each musical sound as its \"aura\". This piece brings these auras into fuller consciousness: at the start the orchestra's staccato chord is immediately decorated by the solo piano's flourish on its harmonic series. These auras permeate the work.  The piece is in a single movement - its various sections related rhythmically.  It was first performed by Barbara King and the Victoria University Orchestra under Peter Walls in August 1995.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: When I was asked to conduct Pakuranga Choral Society in their first concert for 2005, the question of suitable repertoire was discussed with the choir management. We decided that the concert need not be a major oratorio, and I suggested a programme of Bach (�Cantata No. 140�) and Haydn (�Nelson Mass�) with an offer to write something new to complement these works. I was also keen to use one of my ex-students, Morag Atchison, as the soprano soloist in the concert. My work therefore became a piece which would feature her voice, with not too heavy demands on the choir. The texts I finally selected were all on the theme of night, and form a cycle of pieces. The first text, �Night Countdown� by Peggy Dunstan, describes some of the many sights and sounds of the night, but contrasting that with �...only one moon and one me�. The second text is a lullaby: �Rocking my Baby� by Wendy Orr. The third text, �The Middle of the Night� by Karla Kuskin, describes someone, probably a child, lying awake and listening to the sounds of the night. There are strange noises, and the lights go out one by one. The prospect of nightmares is not far away, so you hide under your pillow and shut your eyes. Then you sing to yourself a confidence-boosting song about how you love the middle of the night and all its noises and weird animals � this part of the poem is sung by the choir. The fourth piece sees me returning to the poetry of American Jack Prelutsky and �The Dance of the Thirteen Skeletons�. Here we do have a nightmare � thirteen skeletons dancing around a snowy graveyard! Here, the choir sings the chorus which describes the noises the skeletons make, and the accompaniment makes passing references to the well-known �Danse Macabre� by Saint Sa�ns. The final piece is appropriately titled �Last Song�, by James Guthrie. This short poem is a brief �good night� wish. �Night Visions� was first performed on 22nd May 2005 by Morag Atchison (soprano) with Pakuranga Choral Society, conducted by the composer.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Lilburn composed these songs in 1958 for the baritone Donald Munro and his wife the violist Jean McCartney, who gave the first broadcast performance.  The influence of serialism on the composer�s style at this point in his career makes for a challenging vocal line, especially in the first two songs.  Nonetheless, Lilburn�s work capitalizes on the affinities between voice and viola, and exploits technical capabilities of the viola to evoke moods rather than painting the words.  In the penultimate verse of �Warning of Winter�, for example, the viola�s wavering line, thickened with chords, heralds the darkness of winter that �descends the flowered pathway�.  Such subtle evocation of the text is also found in �Blow, Wind of Fruitfulness�.  Here the viola�s wide leaps to high trills are to be executed with the bow placed over the fingerboard; this evokes the troubling paradoxes of spring, the �Birds that are silent now/And buds of barren springing�.  Between these bleak poles, the viola and voice pairing are used with bold irony in �Song of Allegiance�.  This march is a poet�s humble yet robust reflection on his own position in comparison to the poetic geniuses of the past.  Again Lilburn enlists the viola to speak with and as the poet: wide intervals, tense chords, and motivic stutters convey a poetic voice that is �cracked and harsh�. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: T�-mata-uenga \"God of War, Spirit of Man\" was inspired by the Maori story of creation. In summary, the story starts in the beginning when the world between Rangi-nui, the Sky Father, Papa-t�-�-nuku, the Earth Mother, was cramped and dark. Their children could not grow in this environment and were forced to take action to survive and Rangi and Papa were forced apart - creating the world, as we know it today. I have portrayed the part of the story where T�-mata-uenga struggles to tear Rangi from Papa.   �T�-mata-uenga...leapt at the task, hacking wildly at the sinews that bound Earth and Sky, making them bleed. It is with this act that the sacred red clay, or ochre, was made. But even T�, the fiercest of the sons, could not sever Rangi from his lover Papa.�  There are two distinct themes alternating throughout the work. To represent the �God of War� there are two dominant motives; the semitone, which is used to portray his frustration from his incapability to separate his parents. Secondly, I have used militant rhythmic passages to emphasise the act of war. The second theme is more angular. It reflects another side of T�-mata-uenga, the more complex �Spirit of Man�. It leaps and slides around the dissonant augmented 4th interval. Gradually, another more legato melodic line is infused with the angular theme that takes the piece into a calmer section, which has an almost triumphant melodic line.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Angst: an acute but non-specific sense of anxiety or remorse (Collins Concise Dictionary)  This is not intended to be an easy-listening, carefree piece. I wanted to portray a deep-seated sense of angst, creating a feeling of uneasiness in the  listener. The flute and cello bear a similar angst, at times dealing with this independently, yet always returning to share in their anxiety. Quarter-tone inflections disconcert the harmonies, with tremolo, flutter-tongue and a recurring minor ninth adding to the tension. The material gradually unravels, only to fold in on itself again, remaining unresolved.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Commissioned by the Dowse Art Gallery, Lower Hutt, for its 1983 Concert Series of NZ music. The first performance was given on the 27th November 1983 by the Amabile String Quartet (Alan Foster, Glenda Craven, Lyndsay Mountfort, Annemarie Meijers), the players all being members of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. The 'String Quartet No.1' was also performed at the National Art Gallery, Wellington in 1983, and at the University of Otago, Dunedin, NZ in 1986. 'String Quartet No.1' is a concise work written in an atonal and at times modernist language somewhat inspired by the music of Alban Berg and Arnold Schoenberg. The second movement is a kind of \"Second Viennese waltz\" - a reference to the Second Viennese School at the beginning of the 20th Century.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: My original setting of the poem \"Na Bl�tha Craige\" (�The Cliff Flowers�) by Liam � Flaitheartaigh was commissioned by the Cois Cladaigh Chamber Choir in Galway, Ireland. The choir had performed several works of mine in the early 1990�s and they invited me to visit in December 1994 for a major concert of my music. For the concert a new work was also requested. The original version was more elaborate a setting than was expected, as was (I suspect) a revised score made in 1997. In 2005, having set the �Our Father� text in Irish (��r nAthair�) for the NUIG Choral Society at the university in Galway, I decided to return to this poem and make an entirely new setting of it. The poem is descriptive of the Aran Islands to the west of Galway. The poet is speaking to the cliff flowers, remarking on the inhospitable place they have found for themselves. The first section begins with the poet addressing the flowers: �What a miserable place you found to ramble in...� while the second section is the flowers� answer. The harmonically static conclusion sets the words �..the music of the sea has us under a spell�. On my last day in Galway in 1994 I was fortunate to be able to travel to the Aran Islands to see first-hand the bleak and rocky landscape described in the poem. This setting of �Na Bl�tha Craige� is dedicated to Brendan O�Connor, the conductor of Cois Cladaigh Chamber Choir. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The starting point for this piece was a curiosity in the metal doors that covered the entrances to cells imbedded in the cliffs near Andersons Bay inlet, in Dunedin. A friend informed me that during the 19th century Maori prisoners were kept there at night, and worked on the Dunedin Harbour land reclamation during the day. Some of these prisoners were brought down to Dunedin from Taranaki in the North Island, as a result of the conflict in 1881 at Parihaka. Upon reading Dick Smith's book 'Ask that Mountain - The story of Parihaka' I learned of one of the most shocking incidents in our country's history. The land wars of the 1860s provoked a new approach from Maori to the protection of their lands. Te Whiti, Tohu and their followers at Parihaka combated the Pakeha land grab by organising passive resistance through a variety of means. In response to unauthorised land confiscation Te Whiti ordered the ploughing of fields, building of fences and planting, all of which impeded the surveyors who wished to carve up the land for settlers. Many were arrested, offering no struggle, and soon prisons around the country were full. Despite the many injustices Te Whiti maintained his policy of passive resistance to the end. In November 1881, government troops entered Parihaka with guns and artillery. They were greeted by Maori women and children chanting songs, but no armed struggle. Te Whiti and Tohu were taken away, the Pa was broken up, and hundreds sent away to prison. Despite a Press blackout, two reporters were smuggled into the Pa, one commenting that \"it was one of the saddest and most painful spectacles I have witnessed\". 'Remember Parihaka' attempts to sum up my thoughts and feelings about the events at Parihaka. The slow opening is peaceful, like a sun rise, with melodic fragments that slowly unfold into a fuller, more passionate statement. Flutes and oboes announce a chant-like theme, based on an actual song composed at the time of the incident. This 'Maori' theme alternates with a more European-sounding theme on solo violin, accompanied by an Irish drum, the bowron. At the heart of the piece the various melodic ideas come together over a grinding, relentless bass, building to a climax. In the short postlude, the peace of the opening is suggested, but now it is tinged with sadness, and a slightly uneasy feeling. This 9-minute piece was written while I was Composer-in-residence with the Southern Sinfonia, in 1994. It was first performed in that year, under the baton of John Hopkins.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The true origins of this Irish text are lost in the mists of time although it is generally agreed to date from around the 9th century. Amongst the various stories of its origins are that it was written by an Irish monk in Austria (or maybe Switzerland), in the margin of a manuscript (or maybe on the back of a page), and in Irish. One story even suggests it was written while the monk was working on the Book of Kells (almost certainly false though). The poem was originally in a form of Gaelic and the generally acknowledged best translation is by the scholar Robin Flower (1881-1946) � an English poet and translator from the Irish language. The name of the cat, Pangur Ban (more correctly Pangur B�n), simply means �white Pangur� or �white cat�, Pangur being a common name for a cat. In translation the cat is referred to as male � a talented tomcat! One source sums up the poem this way: Sometimes called �The Monk and his Cat�, the poem Pangur B�n was written by an Irish monk, in the 9th century. It details the similarities between the scribe hunting appropriate words and solutionis, and his pet cat hunting mice. �Pangur Ban� was written at the request of conductor Jane Money for Boston City Singers in the USA.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Ceol na Fidhle' (pronounced 'kee-OL na fiddle'), for violin and percussion, is based on Celtic bagpipe and fiddle tunes.  The Gaelic title means �tunes for highland fiddle.�  Some of the tunes are obvious while others are almost hidden. 'Prologue' starts with a bang, and is followed by 'Hornpipe' where a familiar tune dances and then scurries away beneath a disguise of accompanying notes and rhythmic displacement.  'The Boatman' slows the pace and melodic decoration suggests the sound of bagpipes playing this rather wistful song.  Finally, Reel returns to the highly-charged drive of the 'Prologue' with a frantic and virtuosic ending.  'Ceol na Fidhle' was written in 1999 for Tasmanian musicians Rachel Bremner and Tom O'Kelly.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: These songs were commissioned by and written for Goeknil Meryem Biner and Tom McGrath, as part of my work at the University of Otago.  Initially, Cilla McQueen offered me the poem 'Bluff Pantoum' to set to music. After the commission from Goeknil and Tom I requested another pantoum from Cilla, and she obliged with 'Mining Lament'. A pantoum has 4-line stanzas, rhymes, and repeats lines in the following pattern: A B C D   B E D F   E G F H   G I H J  etc The poem 'Bluff Pantoum' was written in 2003 for a friend of the poet's, to give to her husband on her birthday.  It draws on images of the sea, which dominate the environment of Bluff, in Southland.  'Mining Lament' (2004) bemoans the destruction of a �golden hill� in Riverton, Southland, by sluicing.  A BLUFF PANTOUM  MINING LAMENT  I went to see the golden hill but it had all been mined away all that's left is an empty bowl of yellow gorse and rutted clay  But it had all been mined away except a clay bluff topped with stone in yellow gorse and rutted clay one stubborn relic stands alone  Only a clay bluff tipped with stone remains of the hill the painter saw one stubborn relic stands alone of a rounded hill of golden ore  Remains of the hill the painter saw rutted clay and a stumbling stream a rounded hill of golden ore sluiced away with a sluicing gun  Rutted clay and a stumbling stream all that's left is an empty bowl sluiced away with a sluicing gun I went to see the golden hill  (after a painting by Christopher Aubrey, Riverton, c. 1870) Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The derailleur is that piece of bicycle componentry which crudely knocks the chain from one sprocket or chain-ring to another, resulting in a higher or lower gear. The sensation experienced on a rider's first encounter with the derailleur is strange: one finds oneself pedalling more or less to cover the same distance, but, once one is aware of the derailleur's benefits, the feeling is one of control over gradient, surface and the elements.  The derailleur is directly analogous in music to the phenomenon of metric modulation, a device pioneered in complex forms by Elliott Carter. In derailleurs, metric modulation is used in tutti passages to express ritardando and accelerando with a jumpy, cog-changing precision. Solo sections stand in contrast by allowing individual players the freedom to impose their own subjectivity on the concepts of slowing down and speeding up.  'derailleurs' was premiered at the Nelson Composers Workshop in 2001.  It was awarded First Prize in the Young Composers Competition at 2002 Asian Composers League in Seoul, Korea and received a concert performance by Stroma in Auckland in 2003.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: When I was initially approached to write this work to celebrate Auckland Choral�s 150th anniversary, I knew I wanted to write a piece that would be accessible, both chorally and instrumentally, to the wider choral community. I wanted it to have a life beyond that of the specific occasion for which it was commissioned. I was also keen to include a �youth� choral element. My first decisions concerned the text. I felt that in writing a work for New Zealand�s oldest arts organisation, I wanted to set one of the texts traditionally associated with a large symphonic choir. Hence the Latin Mass as the basis of the text. I also wanted to include elements which would place the work securely in the Asia/Pacific area. New Zealand is uniquely placed between these two areas of the world, and increasingly looks in both directions for its cultural identity. The �additional� texts are drawn from New Zealand, Pacific and Asian sources. While the main choir largely sings the traditional Latin text, the �youth� choir and soloists sing the other texts. At times this distinction is blurred, most notably towards the end of the work. I also wanted to avoid writing a work that became a catalogue of �trendy effects� and ethnic/cultural associations. I�ve used specific musical allusions sparingly in both the choral parts and the scoring. (Hence also the deliberate spelling �Pacifica� rather than �Pasifika�.) The instrumentation is the same as that of Bernstein�s �Chichester Psalms�. This was a practical decision. It is an ensemble that is not hard to assemble: 3 each of trumpets and trombones, 5 percussionists, 2 harps, and strings. It also provides the Bernstein with a companion piece suitable to fill out a concert. The opening �Kyrie� begins with a distant voice suggesting a Maori �karanga� � a calling together. The music then becomes more rhythmic with the women�s voices presenting a lyrical melody. The men�s voices enter at the �Christe eleison�, with the repeat of the �Kyrie� introducing the two solo voices. The second movement combines a traditional Maori text of unknown authorship with Joy Cowley�s bi-lingual �Morning Blessing�. The percussionists suggest the rhythmic sound of pois, while the upper strings and harps suggest a guitar (a guitar may also be added). The �youth� choir sings the Maori text while the women of the main choir sing the English words of the Cowley text, and the men the Maori words. The next four movements set the text of the �Gloria�. The third movement begins with lively and rhythmic music, giving way later to more sustained singing. The end of the movement pays homage to the �Chichester Psalms� where the opening rhythmic music returns quietly against as sustained note in the choir � emulating the end of the second movement of the Bernstein. The fourth movement, �Domine Deus� is for soprano solo, while the fifth movement �Qui tollis� features both soloists. The sixth movement initially features the alto soloist, with the main choir soon joining in. The music is lively until more sustained music from the first part of the �Gloria� returns at the words �Cum Sancto Spiritu...�. Finally the opening �Gloria� music returns and the movement ends with a noisy and energetic �Amen�. The seventh movement features the �youth� choir with just the percussion section. Here the music suggests a type of Pacific Island choral singing, using a �call and response� technique typical of such choral traditions and also of many Afro-American spirituals. The text is a simple entreaty to God, sung in the Tongan language. This work is essentially a �missa brevis� � a Mass without the Credo. Once I reached the Credo text it became obvious that to include it would mean a work of more substantial length than required. However I decided to include a short instrumental movement, as a meditation on that text. While working on the music I added the two solo voices as well � they sing the opening and closing lines of the Credo text. It is a dark, brooding and questioning movement. Following a brief dissonant opening section, the music develops into a long slow canon for the strings and harps. Once the voices enter, the preceding music reappears with a simpler harmonic framework. The movement ends rather abruptly although quite gently, but still without a sense of complete resolution. The Sanctus allows the men�s voices a chance to feature. After two attempts at writing a noisy vigorous movement, I ended up writing music that starts gently and rather like plainsong - the music is marked �reverently�. The �Pleni sunt coeli� section begins softly, but gradually as more voice parts enter, it builds to a massive climax. The music returns briefly to a softer and more reflective mood at the end of the movement. The Benedictus returns to music from the Quoniam section of the Gloria. The traditional Latin text is replaced by a Maori translation of the words. The soprano soloist has a melodic line that at times suggests the contour of traditional chant. The Hosanna (�Ohana i runga rawa�) has the main choir alternating bold tonal chords with the treble voices of the youth choir. While writing this movement I felt I wanted something to complement the energetic and noisy singing, and finally decide to incorporate a setting of �Whisper to me� � a lullaby text by Patricia Grace. This work already existed as an independent piece having been commissioned by St Cuthbert�s College (Auckland) in 2003. The words, partly in English and partly in Maori, provide a beautiful counterpoint to the blessing of the preceding music. The lively eleventh movement mixes the Agnus Dei text with a Maori hymn text by Hirini Melbourne. The words speak of being �cleansed by the wind, washed by the rain�. The women of the main choir sing a simple counter-melody part based on the chorale from the fifth movement. I wanted to include texts beyond the immediate Pacific area, to acknowledge that New Zealand is also part of Asia. I finally found the poem �Outing� by noted Singaporean poet Edwin Thumboo. Professor Thumboo is Director of the Centre for the Arts at the National University of Singapore. The text begins �Therefore bring your words with you. They grow in number, shuffle, show disquiet...�, and this seemed to be a wonderful summary of the ideas behind the whole work � a gathering together of diverse texts with their many associations and cultural meanings. The music, sung by the two soloists, is based on music from the canon section of the Credo, somewhat simplified. One of my early choral experiences was to sing in the �Dona nobis pacem� from Bach�s �B minor Mass�, and the gradual unfolding of that music is suggested in my own setting of those words. The music which was first heard as the �Pleni sunt coeli� in the Sanctus reappears. At first it appears intermittently, interrupting the text of �Outing�, then builds gradually to include the youth choir�s voices in a final climax. �Missa Pacifica� then ends with an extended jubilant �Amen� section. The premiere of �Missa Pacifica� was scheduled for not long before my fiftieth birthday. It seemed, on reflection, that this major work presents a summary of my compositional style up to this point. I also sense the beginnings of a change to a leaner style in other recent works, so perhaps �Missa Pacifica� marks a watershed moment in my compositional career. �Missa Pacifica� was commissioned by Auckland Choral (Musical Director Peter Watts) with funding from Creative New Zealand, It was commissioned to mark the choir�s 150th anniversary in 2005. Special thanks go to the authors of the texts used in the work, who so willingly allowed their poetry to be part of this project. �Missa Pacifica� was first performed on 6th November 2005 by Auckland Choral conducted by Peter Watts. The soloists were Morag Atchison (soprano) and Kate Spence (alto), with Piper�s Sinfonia and choirs from Westlake Girls and Boys High Schools, Rangitoto College, Epsom Girls Grammar School and Diocesan School for Girls.

The music aims to create a space in which the musicians, and the voices of their instruments, may speak together. The musical space is flexible, encouraging spontaneous dialogue between the various instrumental voices. Tawhirimatea, the wind god, child of Earth and Sky, represents powerful elemental forces, but he is also capable of gentle playfulness. Te hau refers also to human breath, the force which animates the wind instruments. From the mingling of breath, sweet voices are brought into being.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Clairmont Triptych was written in fulfilment of a commission by Chamber Music New Zealand for the Auckland Wind Quintet with pianist David Guerin to perform on a New Zealand tour in 1988. The music derives its inspiration and impetus from the work of the New Zealand painter Phillip Clairmont (1949 - 1984).  He was something of an enfant terrible of the New Zealand art world, living his life and his painting with a reckless passion and energy.  His work is vibrant and strong, conveying an intense and energetic power.  Aspects of these elements are captured in the music, although it is not programmatic, but connects with paintings through analogy and allusion. Amongst the profusion of themes and ideas there are two prominent recurrent subjects in Clairmont's work - the domestic interior and the self portrait.  These form the thematic base of the first two of the three inter-linked movements of the work.  The first movement, Interiors, mirrors the fractured vibrancy of the Clairmont interiors by use of a very fast toccata-like movement in sequences of fluctuating tempo.  This creates a continuously \"flexing\" aural effect which reflects the unsettling quality of the images. The second movement, Self Portraits, uses a recurring three note motif C-B-Bb.  These are the composer's initials (C-H-B in German), thus the self portrait becomes ambiguous.  The music seeks to realise to an extent the technique and viewpoint of the self portraits.  The third movement, Jimi Rocks, refers to the influence of rock music on Clairmont's painting, particularly during his studies and the early part of his career in Christchurch. The three movement formal structure is a musical equivalent of the triptych format Clairmont often used in his painting. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

A short ricochet motif soon appears, completely unexpectedly, disrupting the flow of the music. This interjection returns over and over, spurring the work on into the allegro section where it infects the melody and appears as the repeated note motif. Gradually the music accelerates until the new motif is almost as fast as the original ricochet. At this point the ricochet is revealed in its original form and the piece shudders to a grinding halt. 'Duo' is the second piece Harris has written for Rolf and Helena, following Wayleggo which was given to them by the composer as a wedding present.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Contact Binaries (2005-6) from Local Economy In astronomy, the term 'contact binary' refers to two astronomical bodies so close to each other that they lightly touch each other. In the case of asteroids, a contact binary is caused when two gravitate toward each other, forming an oddly-shaped single body. In this piece I took the notion of two objects lightly touching and inuencing each other as a loose analogy for the way the trumpet and percussion interact, working through various approaches to unanimity and rhythmic subdivisions and coming together at certain pre-dened rhythmic points that function something like an Aavartanam-a large-scale repeated rhythmic cycle-does in Carnatic music. In contrast to exit wound that follows, the percussion has the lion's share of the active material, while the trumpet punctuates and comments like a back-seat driver.  exit wound (2004) from Local Economy Unlike some governments I could mention, I had a clear idea of my exit strategy when I started out on this incursion into foreign territory. As a result, exit wound-the final module of the larger work-in-progress. Local Economy was the first to be completed. I've finished, so I'll start... Of course the 19-tone trumpet-like humans-is full of tubing and compromises, and just like its more familiar incarnation it aspires to, rather than reliably embodies, its nominal temperament. I don't see this as a problem, as I'm not one to cling to any temperament or tuning system with religious zeal. In a very early phase of the composition I did in fact make a systematic exploration of some 19-tone pitch resources, but the results struck me as sounding far too much like pedagogical exercises to be of interest. Vestiges of these �warming-up licks� do, however, remain. A useful way of approaching the piece might be to think of the trumpet as the character, familiar from science fiction movies, who wakes up one morning to find himself in a new body, and who goes through the clich�d ritual of studying the alien contours of his new visage in the mirror with a mixture of horror and fascination.  By the same token the percussionist could, perhaps, be imagined as some sort of sidekick, offering advice, encouragement and occasionally a dissenting voice. But this is, after all, a piece of music and such crassly reductive quasi-programmatic schemes don't hold for long. The percussionist's set-up, and the performative energies deployed in the part are modelled on those of an improvising percussionist, inspired in part by the Wellington-based percussionist Anthony Donaldson, who ought not be blamed for any shortcomings in this piece. Thanks must go to Stephen Altoft and Lee Ferguson of Duo Contour not only for commissioning the piece with funding from Creative New Zealand, but also for their enthusiasm and forbearance in the face of continually missed deadlines.  Contact Binaries and exit wound may be performed individually The trumpet parts of Local Economy may be played only on a 19-division instrument.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Undoubtedly, this is one of Whitehead�s more unusual collaborations.  The work, intended for five dancers and organ, with soprano added at the composer�s request, was to have been performed in five cathedrals around Britain during the summer of 1982 .  Due to the cancellation of the dance component however, the work received performance in only one of the cathedrals � Carlisle -  but was later presented with a solo dancer, Bronwyn Judge, at the 1987 Sonic Circus in Wellington.  The singer on that occasion was Glenis Johns and the organist Douglas Mews.   The composer initially delayed beginning work on the piece, since her sister was expecting a baby, and a Requiem did not seem an appropriate preoccupation. The successful birth was however followed by two close-family deaths and it was these which provided the composer with the emotional impetus to proceed with the composition.

One of the most heart-warming sights I know of is seeing a community of people trying to save beached whales, a sight that is not uncommon around our coastline. For most New Zealanders, the idea of hunting whales is now abhorrent and worthy of protest at an international level. This piece, entitled 'Whalesong', is my small contribution to that on-going protest. The piece takes its inspiration from a marvelous and famous recording of a humpback whale, made by Frank Watlington of Columbia University Geophysical Field Station, and first released by Roger Payne in 1970.  Some phrases from this song have been incorporated into the music, such as the opening rise of a third. The many sliding phrases in the piece owe a debt to the whale's singing, as do some low rumbling effects on the double bass. The echoing sound world of the underwater is also evoked in the music. Ideas from the whale's song are subjected to compositional processes, in order to create a coherent piece of human music, something the composer has already grappled with in his work for flute, entitled 'Tui' (2004). Whalesong also has a programmatic component to it. Its peaceful song is cruelly interrupted by a harpoon, and the whale is slowly hauled in (signified by the mechanical rhythms in the final section of the piece).  I would like to express my gratitude to Dale Gold for his assistance and advice in writing this piece. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Concerto was written in January 2006 as fulfilment of a long standing promise to write a piece for Saxophonist Simon Brew. What began, in concept, as a modest \"concertino\" grew into a five movement \"grand\" concerto of nearly 30 minutes, which makes it, according to Simon, one of the longer concertos in the Alto Saxophone repertoire; I'm still not quite sure how it happened, it just kept on growing. The Concerto was commissioned by the Wellington Youth Sinfonietta, is dedicated to Simon, and was premiered in May 2006. The first two movements are were later presented at the NZSO-SOUNZ Readings on 6 November 2006. The first movement is an accompanied cadenza for the saxophone which outlines the major thematic material for the concerto. This movement reoccurs, in modified form, as the central episode of the last movement. The second movement is in traditional concerto sonata form. The Concerto unashamedly follows classical structures throughout. Avant-garde it ain't! Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Number two is a meditation on a rising and falling motif from the late piano music of Liszt, the figure shared between the instruments and elaborated on by the clarinet.  The third is based on the triadic harmonies implicit in the final clarinet flourish from the previous piece; the repeating figures gradually ascend until fading into the distance.   Written for and dedicated to Toronto clarinettist Rhonda Rindone, and first performed by members of the Taikodo Ensemble, Sumida Triphony Small Hall, Tokyo, in February 2002.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Curnow requested this work from Lilburn in 1952 for a poetry reading at Auckland University College.  The event took place on the evening of 9 August that year, and involved a substantial amount of poetry (twenty-two poems in total) read by the poets involved.  (Actually the works of eight poets were represented:  Baxter read �Canto at Twenty-seven� by Louis Johnson).  Lilburn�s music was premiered by Antonia Braidwood (violin) and Donald Bowick (piano).  One movement was supposed to precede each reading, providing the audience with the composer�s musical impressions of the work and personality of each poet.  In the event, however, the order was reversed, which led to some confusion for the audience and some displeasure for the composer.  Typical of New Zealand composition of the time, there was no fee to be had for the work.  Lilburn even had to pay his way to Auckland for the rehearsals.   On his return to Wellington, Lilburn shelved and forgot about the work.  It was not until a chance meeting at his doctor's surgery in 1988/89 that he was reminded of its existence by Lady Dorothia Turner, who had reviewed the first performance.  At that point Lilburn contacted the violinist Dean Major to ask if he would be interested in performing it.  After some negotiation the composer also determined that he would write a narration to go along with the music in lieu of the twenty-two poems, and (most surprisingly) volunteered to read this himself.   Salutes to Seven Poets was recorded by Concert FM on 5 September 1989, by Major (violin), with Rae de Lisle (piano). As if to make up for thirty-eight years of neglect of the work, this recording received a Mobil Award in 1990. (Note by Nancy November). Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

It comes from the anthology �A Book of Pacific Lullabies� which also provided the texts for my choral cycle �Whisper You All The Way Home�. �Whisper to me� is a short lullaby with a verse in English followed by a verse in Maori. The English verse is set in a conventionally melodic style, while the Maori verse is set in a style suggesting the melodic and rhythmic forms of traditional waiata. Against this second verse a solo cello plays the original melody. The work ends by dissipating into sounds suggesting night. The text for �Whisper to me� is used by kind permission of the author Patricia Grace. �Whisper to me� was commissioned by St Cuthbert�s College, Auckland in 2003.

An overture was suggested as the most useful type of piece to add to the orchestra�s repertoire. The piece uses two contrasting ideas. The first idea grows out of the opening fanfare-like gestures and develops into a lyrical flowing melody of short phrases. The second main idea is hinted at in the opening pages, and appears later as the middle section of the work. This is a more march-like idea but with important use of syncopation. After some brief combination of the two ideas, the lyrical melody returns in the third main section of the work, with a final nod in the direction of the march music at the end. Throughout the work, ideas are generally stated in full rather than significantly developed. The work is scored for standard classical chamber orchestra. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Maui, the fifth and youngest child, was born at the edge of the sea.  His mother, Taranga, thought he was stillborn, and wrapped him in a tuft of her hair and set him adrift.  He was cared for by the seaweed until a breeze blew him ashore, where he was saved and brought up by one of his great-ancestors. Maui was a great prankster.  In one of his mischievous moods he decided to put out all the fires in the world.  To bring fire back, he had to find Mahuika, the goddess of fire.  He was awestruck upon meeting her, but decided to play a trick on her by taking fire from her fingernails one at a time, until she realised his game and threw fire to the ground, catching everything alight.  Maui changed himself into a hawk to escape the flames, which singed his feathers.  He called upon his ancestor to send rain and drench the fire, depriving Mahuika of her powers. Maui decided to defeat death by journeying to where the earth meets the sky, where lived his great-ancestress Hine nui te po (\"Great Hine the Night\").  He was accompanied by many birds, and told them his plan to enter the body of the sleeping Hine and so defeat death.  The birds sat quietly trying not to laugh as Maui, in the form of a caterpillar, crawled towards Hine.  Suddenly the fantail could be quiet no longer and laughed aloud, dancing about with delight.  Hine awoke with a start, realised Maui's trickery, and he was killed. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This piece is affectionately known as 'Bugs' or 'the Bug piece' to me, and that is what it is about: the wonderful creepy crawlies native to New Zealand.  Motivation for writing this piece came from two sources.  As part of my residency with the Auckland Philharmonia in 2004, I was required to write a piece for a concert specifically at children and families.  Naturally, it needed simple structures, lots of energy and a bit of fun. The second motivation with regard to a specific programme was a love for all native New Zealand fauna, and not just beautiful birds.  So much music has been written with bird song or in celebration of New Zealand's landscape.  But nothing to my knowledge had been written about the humble creatures which often inspire revulsion rather than awe.  Despite their not so cuddly appearance, native insects and invertebrates are just as fascinating and unique to these islands of ours as any other endemic wildlife. The first movement is Giant Weta.  Often the most notorious for exciting disgust, these magnificent insects are quite amazing, but all to often fall prey to introduced mammals. The second movement is titled Giant Snails.  Native giant snails are enormous, and often live in kauri trees, or feed on giant earthworms on the forest floor. The Nelson Cave Spider is a extremely unique creature.  Like so many other creatures and plant life of New Zealand, it is a relic of ancient times and preserved by New Zealand's isolation. Finally, perhaps the most unusual of all is the Peripatus, sometimes known as the velvet worm, a blue centipede-like creature that crawls through undergrowth in search of prey.

It focuses on aspects of rhythm and ostinato, and it is based on the flamenco principle of 3+3+2+2+2 (12 beat cycle).  Flamenco music is based on Spanish gypsy music, and is often accompanied by clapping, so there are clapping parts included for members of the orchestra.  The audience may learn the simple clapping patterns (on the next page), so they can accompany the orchestra when they hear the patterns.  The central section in 5/8 is intended as an asymmetrical contrast to the duple and triple meters of the outer sections. \"Alegria� means �joy� or �happiness� in Spanish.

It was a glorious riot of sound with its own special meaning for it was in confirmation of the health of a wondrous and unique ecosystem. To my regret, I arrived in New Zealand in the late twentieth century to find most of the orchestra seats empty. Walking through the ancient forest.......I heard nothing but the whisper of leaves blowing in the wind. It was like the rustle of the last curtain fall on an orchestra that will be no more.� Tim Flannery Future Eaters. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: These four short songs were written with a view to providing material for very young singers, although they have probably ended up a little more challenging than intended. However, they are written with a fairly narrow pitch range (mostly within the octave from middle C up), and with nothing too challenging in the rhythms. The accompaniments are simple and supportive, while only rarely actually doubling the vocal line. All four texts are traditional lullabies. In the first two cases they are simply from �Anonymous� sources, while the third is of African origin, and the fourth is Canadian. The first text is nautical in its theme � all on board a boat are asleep and the singer sings to the fishes while thinking of �...the ones I love best�. The second text is a little piece of nonsense about the Man in the Moon. Wanting a drink of milk, he tries to dip into the Milky Way � however two of the constellations (the Big Bear and the Little Bear) see him and frighten him with their growling. Needless to say, he spills his milk! The third text is a short African poem, which contrasts the night�s wind and rain with a mother�s prayer for her child�s safety. The music turns to a more dynamic style, reminiscent of calypso rhythms. The fourth text is a picture of a mother gently singing while rocking her baby. The middle stanza of this is the very familiar �Rockabye baby, on the treetop...� known throughout the English speaking world. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Karohirohi', which means iridescent, shimmering, the sparkling of light on water, is the point of arrival rather than of departure in this piece.  Written for the forces of a classical symphony, 'Karohirohi' draws on characteristics of classical form, and of classical concerto form, not so much in terms of exposition, development and recapitulation, nor in terms of the syntactical sentence and period structure (although these aspects are doubtless present), but more in the sense of classical style as it was perceived in the eighteenth century. At that time there was a gradual rather than an abrupt change away from the characteristics of Baroque music, and classical masterpieces drew on and seamlessly combined a variety of influences. In the background were the dance forms of the Baroque, but on to these were mapped  remnants of older styles - learned style, such as fugue and imitation, styles from different genres, or forms of expression, such as brilliant or virtuoso style,  singing style, or sensibility style, and even imitative styles, such as  military fanfares and hunting calls. 'Karohirohi', to my ears, like much music written today, is similarly eclectic, drawing on a range of reference appropriate to this time and place. Its single movement incorporates various aspects of three-movement concerto form, before dissipating in a coda. 'Karohirohi' is dedicated to Carolyn Mills. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This short work for 3-part male voices and piano sets a text by poet W.H. Auden. The text tells of the gradual approach of a group of soldiers and suggests a time of war in an earlier era of English history. The text is essentially a conversation, with most verses beginning with the question �O what is....� � the answers detailing the progress of those approaching: have they stopped at the doctor, or the parson, or the farmer? The first character becomes more frantic towards the end, as the second decides it is time to leave: �...I promised to love you, dear, but I must be leaving�. Poet W.H. Auden was born in England but spent much of his life in the USA, having become an American citizen after his move there in 1939. His first book of poems appeared in 1928, with his 1930 collection �Poems� firmly establishing his reputation. He served in the Spanish Civil War, and throughout his life was prolific as a poet, playwright, essayist, librettist and editor.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The piece is constructed around various traditional folk melodies. The main theme is based on \"Land of the Silver Birch\" and, symbolically, other themes come from \"I's the b'y that built the boat\", \"Freres Jaques\" and of course, a reference to the national anthems of France and England (distorted to reflect those cultures being modified to Canada's use). Within the tone-poem is an evocation of sunset on the prairies, a hoedown and a magnificent climax representing the Rocky Mountains and reflecting the optimism that should continue to be Canada's birthright.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In 1990 I attended the launch of Cilla McQueen's new book 'Berlin Diary'.  This diary made a big impression on me, initially because it brought back memories of my own trip to Europe.  I also liked the brilliant mixing of poetic and prosaic styles, and the vivid descriptions of people and places.  Something else that imprsssed me was the strong contrast between the inhuman political situation in Berlin (the wall was still up) and the natural, peaceful beauty of Dunedin, New Zealand. (Cilla's and my own home town).  A few months later the Aramoana tragedy (where a deranged gunman killed 13 people - Aramoana is a remote seaside township at the end of the Otago peninsula) changed that around.  Cilla's beautiful, almost ecstatic centrepiece in the dairy \"O Aramoana\" now took on a terrible subtext, and it seemed as if the inhumanity of Berlin had come to the remote beach community.  A year later, the Berlin wall finally came down, and the unification of East and West Germany became a reality.  When Judy Bellingham approached me in 1991 to write a song cycle for her, I immediately wanted to set extracts from the 'Berlin Diary', to capture these layers of dramatic historical irony along with the essence of a marvellous text.   In reality I was able to only set a fraction of the diary to music, and hence the title of my work - 'Berlin Fragments' (which I would also like to think suggests the breaking of the Berlin wall into bits).  After talking to Cilla about the work, I decided to make \"O Aramoana\" the heart of the work, around which somewhat shorter texts are clustered.  Sections are often linked by a recurrent chord in the bottom of the piano (the dyad E-F), which I have imagined as a tombstone in musical terms.  Framing the work are brief sections which convey the flight to and from Berlin (the \"green below\" being an unmistakeable reference to a return to New Zealand).  The 23 minutes of this song cycle run continuously.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Translation of title: 'The winds of Kaiaua'   In Maori mythology, Kaiaua was a child of Tahwiri, the great god of the wind.  The winds of Kaiaua are the nor'-westers that frequently sweep across the Canterbury plains.  This piece describes an old Maori legend about a chief who disliked the hot nor'-westers so much that he instructed a tohunga (or priest) to perform a chant, making the mountains bigger and stopping the winds coming. However, this caused the plains to become too damp and miserable for the people to live there. The chief prayed for the return of the winds, and eventually they do indeed return, forcing their way over the Southern Alps.   The music for this one-movement piece is directly programmatic, owing something to the composer's experience as Composer-in-schools (1987), where childrens' imagination very readily turns sounds into images. Consequently, a theme from Ritchie's own youth (from age 13) is used in the piece, to depict the march of the wind at the end.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

I was living in Northumberland, on the moors north of Newcastle, very near the house where Kathleen Raine had spent her childhood. When I was asked to write a piece for the Cumbria Quartet and mezzo-soprano Elizabeth Lamb, Raine's poetry was an obvious choice, as its northern imagery was very familiar to me. The first performance was in the historic church in Grasmere on June 11th, 1980, during the Lake District Festival.  Although the piece is designed as a single entity, the quartet falls into four clearly-defined sections in its setting of the four short poems. The vocal writing is relatively simple (rhythmically at least), and the writing for the quartet sometimes reflects the poetic imagery or mood, and is sometimes derived from the formal structure of the poems.  The text, which comes from 'The Oval Mirror' published by Hamish Hamilton,  is used with the kind permission of the author and her publishers.   Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The texts are both nineteenth century English ones, and the musical style is deliberately 'mock Victorian', even down to a passing hint of a well-known song from that era.

In the late 19th and early 20th century it was famous for its hunts, garden parties, dances, music and friendly welcomes, which is still evident today.  The atmosphere of the Victorian period, with the ballroom and spacious grounds, is captured in this music.   The powerful brass chords show the strong character of Allan Kerr Taylor, owner and builder of this stately home.  The spirits of the three unmarried daughters, the last family residents, are solo woodwind features.  The shimmering tremolo string passages and harp arpeggios depict the 'ghostly' games played by Aunt Muriel on the children.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Later performances in Bern (with a short lecture about it by me) and in Schaffhausen. Bruno Spoerri also played the tape abroad, in a demonstration of our work here. Preparation for the work involved analysis of several Chinese instruments; Ch'in (a zither), gong and wood block. The wave analysis was done'with a computer program and my imitations were realized on the Computer Music Center's DMX. There are two sets of texts: from the Tao Te Ching (Lao Tse) and from the I Ching. The Lao Tse texts were chosen by me and set with traditional notation. The I Ching texts were chosen by chance (with the computer) and set with a computer generated graphic notation. Proportions within the piece were also made with a computer program using chance and units of Golden Section. (More details in the introduction to the score). Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Needless to say it was a rainy day - but at times the rain abated; at times it grew more intense than before; at times it only served to illuminate the natural beauty of the scenery up in that area of Auckland. In this piece, I have tried to capture all of this. The more 'flowing' aspects of the piece were intended to capture the sometimes cathartic nature of rain, and the occasionally abrupt changes in feel, texture and tonality were inspired by the abrupt changes in weather that we in Auckland often experience!

I am grateful to Robert Craft and the Stravinsky Estate for permission to use it here. Stravinsky's melody is played by the first trumpet in each of the three chorale settings. All three are canonic in treatment, with the texture increasing from two parts in Chorale 1 to four parts (plus a tuba bass-line) in Chorale 3.  The two Interludes take off from the finale notes of the chorale. In contrast both are quick, with a somewhat Stravinskian rhythmic exhuberance; Interlude 1 is scored for a trio (excluding the two trumpets), Interlude 2 for the full quintet.

Rather, it lurches and limps in ponderous arcs, to the irregular rhythms of diesel engines. This has been my landscape; Machine Noise my \"landscape prelude\". The prelude is extremely virtuosic and calls for an almost machine machine-like performance. Yet, in the book 'Consciousness Explained, Daniel Dennett convincingly argues that there is nothing about human, consciousness, emotion or experience that cannot be encompassed by a purely physical, biological and mechanical explanation. We are, in oth other words, just machines - but very clever machines. Machine Noise was commissioned by Chamber Music New Zealand for Stephen De Pledge. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This symphony has three movements. All three start with the same pulse (   = 60), and the third movement also ends at this tempo. Both the rhythmic conflicts in the music and its rhythmic connections (changes of tempo within a movement) are related in the ratio 3:2. This ratio also expresses the interval of a fifth, which is throughout an important arrival point and is the music's final destination.These conflicts and changes are also associated with timbre: very often strings and brass are opposed with wind and percussion acting as mediators. The first movement is most concerned with conflicts. The opening idea announces this very simply with an opposition of two pentatonic modes (black and white keys on a keyboard), and this conflict remains unresolved at the end of the movement. The second movement alternates - combining slow movement and scherzo. The slow beginning presents an unwinding melodic line in the wind against a haze of overlapping chords on brass and strings. The fast scherzo breaks across this and tosses rhythmic fragments from section to section. The slow and fast are later combined, but in the end the fast wins, finishing the movement at breakneck speed. The third movement emphasises connections and resolutions.It is a set of variations on a chorale-like tune, starting at the basic pulse and gradually getting faster until the final variation, a quick waltz, is moving at three times the opening speed. From here the tempo shifts back and the chorale tune is combined with references to the beginning of the first movement. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

This not only provides a way for the spectral qualities of the flute to be extended in the tape part, but also allows for a singularity in the overall timbral character of the work. The flute part utilises several extended techniques (such as tongue rams). The work attempts to incorporate each of these extended techniques as an integral and integrated part of the overall sound world of the piece. The opening inhale/exhale breathing sounds establishes the nature of the dialogue between the flute and tape parts in the work.  'Sound Cylinders' was written for Tony Ferner over the summer of 1996 and 1997.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

It was written at the request of their conductor, David Hamilton, for performance at a competition administered by the New Zealand Choral Federation.  The text is a rather free translation of Proverbs 3.5, made with the intention of speaking simply in the language of today while preserving the message of the source.  The tune matches the words in its simplicity and directness.  However it is presented in such a way as to incorporate a number of styles of singing - unison, solo, imitation, chordal, descant - while at the same time lying well within the reach of inexperienced singers.  The piano part is perhaps a little more ambitious, and requires a pianist of some years' experience. The text is as follows: Faith is trusting God when we can not make sense of everything. Look to him in all you do, and he will help you to find the best way. Do not be limited by what you understand right now. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'String Quartet No.2' was composed in Devonport, Auckland, between November 1994 and February 1995 with financial assistance provided by the New Zealand Composers� Foundation and the Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa. The first performance was given at the Watershed Theatre, Auckland on the 10th March 1995 by Simon McLellan & Sarah Hart (violins), Judith Williams (cello) and with the composer as violist. Denys Trussell wrote in a subsequent review (Quote Unquote, April 1995): \"Nigel Keay...had his substantial and dramatic Second Quartet given its first performances at these concerts. It is in part a synthesis of the strictly modernist and the freer post-modernist harmonic constructions: Keay is moving away from a music of sustained dissonance in this work towards a music where consonance and dissonance interact. The middle movement, slow and introspective, is a striking instance of this.\" Since then 'String Quartet No.2' has established itself as one of the composer�s most-performed, and most widely-performed works having been played in New Zealand, Thailand, Japan, France and Germany by several different formations. Nigel Keay's 'Second String Quartet' was performed at the 17th Conference and Festival of the Asian Composers League in Bangkok by the Ensemble Contemporary Alpha (Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music), and at the �Stella Nova� Concerts in Tokyo. It has been performed also in NZ by Ensemble Philharmonia (members of the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra), and the Nevine String Quartet (Elizabeth Patchett & Janet Armstrong - violins, Peter Barber - Viola, & Robert Ibell - Cello (members of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra)) (recording and broadcast by Radio NZ's Concert FM). It received performances in 2004 & 2005 by the Quatuor Aphan�s in Paris and Germany. The writing of the quartet was inspired by a love of the medium, particularly as a player having experienced the late quartets of Beethoven and other repertoire. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

In the piano version, Lilburn incorporates idiomatic guitar gestures into accompaniment throughout:  strumming, broken chords, and fading guitar snaps.  These serve not only to evoke the guitar, but also to strengthen one�s sense of the songs as self-reflective, self-accompanied cycle of �songs within songs�.  Lilburn subsequently arranged the cycle for tenor and guitar (1953, SLD-47), and for tenor and piano(1954, EC-26).  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Materials are reused at fairly short intervals in a spiral or coil framework, sometimes quoted exactly, often altered drastically and always recontextualised to achieve a sense of continual development.  The composer is interested in first reactions to pieces of new music: does the mind recall sonic events and conjure meaningful relationships between them, or, in the absense of repeated hearings, is the new musical experience heard simply as fantasia?   'circuit:spiral' was a finalist in the 2006 Douglas Lilburn Prize, in which it was awarded the Panel Prize.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This song sets a poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson. Tennyson was the son of a clergyman in Lincolnshire. His early literary attempts included a play, The Devil and the Lady, composed at 14, and poems written with his brothers Frederick and Charles but entitled Poems by Two Brothers (1827). Upon the death of his father in 1831, Tennyson became responsible for the family and its precarious finances. His volume Poems (1832) included some of his most famous pieces, such as \"The Lotus-Eaters,\" \"A Dream of Fair Women,\" and \"The Lady of Shalott.\" Tennyson's next published work, Poems (1842), expressed his philosophic doubts in a materialistic, increasingly scientific age and his longing for a sustaining faith. The new poems included \"Locksley Hall,\" \"Ulysses,\" \"Morte d'Arthur,\" and \"Break, Break, Break.\" With this book he was acclaimed a great poet, and in addition, he was granted an annual government pension of �200 in 1845. The Princess (1847) from which �Ask Me No More� comes, was followed in 1850 by the masterful In Memoriam, an elegy sequence that records Tennyson's years of doubt and despair. The same year saw his appointment as poet laureate and his marriage to Emily Sellwood, whom he had courted since 1836 but had been unable to marry because of his precarious financial position. Occasional poems, such as the \"Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington\" (1852) and \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" (1855), were part of his duties as laureate. Tennyson passed his last years in comfort. In 1883 he was created a peer and occupied a seat in the House of Lords. Throughout much of his life he was a popular as well as critical success and was venerated by the general public. Unappreciated early in the 20th cent., Tennyson has since been recognized as a great poet. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Both words and music have been shaped so they can be sung and understood without much difficulty, although without sacrificing musical and textual standards.   It is hoped that the song will appeal to young and old alike. The original accompaniment was for piano, but this has been rewritten  in order to suit organ as well. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: From the Southern Marches was the brain-child of George Griffiths, historian and owner of Otago Heritage Books in Dunedin.  He writes:  'For many years I'd pondered the nature of the southern region and the people who live in it - particularly the contraditcory characteristics passed on from our Scots forebears, with their unrelenting capacity for hard work and their uncertain trust in the rewards to be gained from it.  in a broader view, it seemed the development of a southern character was  story so rich in human spirit and diversity that it demanded some kind of expression.'   The 'kind of expression' depended very much on George's choice of texts which come from a wide variety of sources, ranging from old Maori chants to more recent poetry.  The work progresses more or less in a chronological manner, but avoids becoming a potted history of the south.  Each text from each particular era focusses on a special characteristic of the time - whether it is the reckless optimism of the gold miners in the 1860s, or the grim reality of the needle-workers in the 1880s who were virtual slaves.  George has drawn on a rich variety of ideas and texts, so that more serious items are contrasted with humour, as in Thatcher's 'The Old Identity' or 'King' Dick Seddon's political speech.  Some items involve text with existent tunes, and the music becomes an arrangement (as is the case with 'The Old Identity').  Sometimes these tunes are just a starting point for lengthy elaboration, as in 'Bright Fine Gold', based on the tune for 'Hot Cross Buns'.   'From the Southern Marches' has a format that is similar to oratorio, with alternations between solo vocal items and choruses, with the addition of two purely orchestral sections.  There is even references to the 'recitative' style in 'The Jubilee', 'Southern Education' and elsewhere. It runs to almost two hours in length, and is divided into two halves. Here are the individual sections:   PART ONE  Orchestral Prelude  The Southerners are not unwary pigeons (texts by Boultbee, Te Rauparaha/Potiki, Kaukoe) - choir, bass, soprano  A Meeting of Peoples (Boultbee/Kennard) - choir  There's Nae Place like Otago Yet (texts by Barr, Blair)- orchestral prelude, soprano solo, choir  The Stars of Orion (text by Read; nursery rhme) - tenor, sopranos, choir  The Old Identity (text by Thatcher) - bass, tenor, choir   PART TWO  Unlock the Land (texts by Wood, Braken, McLauchlan, Dallas) - choir, with tenor, bass, sopranos  Southern Education (texts by Stafford; Griffiths, trad.) - bass, choir  The Jubilee (texts by Seddon/Griffiths, various) - bass, sopranos  Southerns, Come Follow me Out of your Hills (texts by August, music by Lithgow) - choir  People at an Exhibition - orchestra  These are Our Lands (text by Glover) - tenor, all soloists, choir  That Old Identity (Thatcher's ghost) - soloists and choir   This work was composed in 1997, and first performed in March, 1998, to coincide with the 150th anniversary of settlement in Otago and Southland.  The performers on this occasion were The Dunedin Sinfonia under Nicholas Braithwaite, with the City of Dunedin Choir, Southern Consort of Voices, Southern Youth Choir, plus four soloists: Ana James(soprano), Deborah Wai Kapohe(soprano), Iain Fraser(tenor), and Jonathan Lemalu(bass).  Such was the success of this premiere, From the Southern Marches was repeated in December of the same year, this time with Dobbs Franks conducting.   A commercial CD was released in 1998 using the live recording of the premiere.  Copies of this are still available from the composer, or from Otago Heritage Books (500 Great King Street, Dunedin).   In 1998, Otago Heritage Books won a Special Merit Award in the National Business Review's Business Sponsorship of the Arts Awards . Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The first prelude is a short piece in folk style (subsequently enlarged upon as movement four of A Little Suite for Yuji and Rieko for violin and piano); the second is an arrangement of the traditional Japanese folk song Sakura Sakura, and is dedicated to Trish Fagan and Owen Cameron on the occasion of their marriage in December 2000.  The third prelude is more spacious in feeling, composed entirely on the white keys of the piano, while the fourth is the liveliest piece of the set, and is based on a Chinese folk song; the original melody is heard at the very end of the piece.  The first performance of preludes one to three was given by Donald Nicholls, clarinet, and Helen Webby, harp, at an outdoors performance in the Hamilton Gardens Festival of March 2001.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Four Stabiles' was composed when I was newly graduated from university, after I had decided that I liked the idea of becoming a composer. Margaret Nielsen graciously gave it an early airing and the score was promptly published by Waiteata Press Music, giving me a tremendous boost of self-confidence. The �60s were a time when musical abstraction was the vogue, when a mathematical structure justified the music. Thus the inverted palindromic form of Stabile I based on its two versions of the all-interval symmetrically invertible 12-tone chord was a source of considerable composerly satisfaction!  All but one of the dedicatees, personal friends, have long since either drifted or passed away. The one remaining contact, William Dart, is characterised in Stabile III, a tender portrait of someone who was then living a curiously isolated existence. Tony (Stabile 1) I admired for his good looks and spiritual curiosity, while winsome Robert (Stabile 2) was the object of one of my compulsive crushes. Gaye (Stabile 4) was a passionately energetic fellow student at Teacher�s College, who, sadly, took her own life a few years later. These pieces use fixed register, that is, each note (C, C#, etc) is heard at only one register, creating a static vertical relationship between the pitches. Variety is achieved by viewing the �sound object� from different perspectives, just as a viewer explores a static sculptural structure (a stabile) by walking around it. Movements one and three permit two possible registers for each note by using two chords, one the inversion of the other. Another feature of the first movement is that it is palindromic. The gentle sounds of the Stabile 2 suggest a star-lit night, Stabile 4 strives for rhythmic momentum to counter the essentially static compositional technique, while an informed listener will easily recognise the debt that Stabile 3 owes to the first of Douglas Lilburn�s �Nine Short Pieces�.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The three poems by Jean Toomer were selected for their beauty of language, wide palette of colours and imagery, and strength of feeling. I stumbled upon them while browsing a website of American poets. I had not intended to set work by an author who was so politically motivated, but the instant reaction in my heart on reading them made these a must. I must confess to not understanding the poems completely, but that air of mystery appeals all the same. I've attempted to set the poems in an honest and respectful way, but I have had to rely on my own interpretation and instinct in doing so. This set of songs is a quest for, or dream of, beauty, and the difficulties one meets on the way. Emotional poles are used to structure the music and highlight my interpretation of the texts.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Written in Hiroshima while I was a Master�s student at Elisabeth University of Music, and first performed at my graduation concert from that institution.  The piece opens with the ascending four-note motif from Debussy�s �The Snow is Dancing� from the Children�s Corner suite; gradually the motif is repeated in various ranges of both instruments, followed by soft passages from firstly piano, then violin.  The piece concludes with the transposed motif heard over a chordal ostinato. The piece was influenced in some way by the music of Morton Feldman, whom I was studying at the time.  Published by Wai-te-ata Press Music Editions, Wellington, and released on CD in a performance by Mark Menzies and Dan Poynton, on Wai-te-ata WTA001.   Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The German poet Rilke has long been a favourite of both Ross and his wife, Barbro, who first drew his attention to the poems. In describing the work, Harris comments: �The world my settings evoke is romantic, nostalgic, angst ridden; qualities which suit so well Susan�s voice and temperament. They are a little bit Mahlerian I suppose; some people say Webern, but I don�t really think so, although they are a little bit fragmentary. I wrote them so quickly that they just follow the text. �Whatever I do, I always write lines. All the music is linear, whatever the style. Even the chord progressions are going to be linear, whether harmony is important or not. This means the music is goal oriented, even if the goal is never reached; which is actually quite good for expressing what Rilke is about.� Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

As a composer I wanted to make a small mark of respect to these greats with some dedications.  I have also taken a cue from Bach and Shostakovich and included contrapuntal forms within these preludes.  While not wanting to restrict myself to the form of a fugue, there are several preludes which are close in spirit to fugues:  Nos.17 and 19 for instance, are what I would call my 'prelugues'.  There is also a passacaglia (No.16) which owes a debt to Shostakovich.   I have conceived these pieces as a unified whole. Within them I have attempted to cover a whole variety of characters and moods, from the improvisational and experimental to the lyrical and gentle, from the wild and gestural to the calm and peaceful, from the quirky and 'black' to the light and sunny, from the depressive to the resolved.   The extensive technical planning and preparation behind these pieces has been fun for me as the composer, but in the end it is the sound and musical expression that matters.  I would like to think this voyage of discovery has led to something new and interesting to listen to.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Terrestrial Mirror' was written in 2004 and is a contemplation on the idea of voyage and discovery, in both the physical and musical worlds. Now residing in Western Europe and being originally from New Zealand, the voyage to the antipodes has become a regular occurrence for me. The title �Terrestrial Mirror\" refers to the Pacific Ocean, in fact a phrase coined by the New Zealand author Michael King, where he suggests that the Pacific Ocean with its scattered islands is somewhat of a reflection of the night sky. Each return to the Pacific evokes a contemplation of the multiple discoveries of New Zealand, first by Polynesian then European navigators. The choice of a work for Flute, Viola & Harp grew out of working with Eric Kohenoff & Alix Couillaud on Debussy�s Sonata, and Jeffrey Harrington's Oneiromancer along with other repertoire of this instrumentation. In 'Terrestrial Mirror' the flute represents the sky and wind, the viola represents the sea, and the third instrument, the harp represents the land. The analogy in the instrumentation is of course the flute often soaring in the higher registers with the viola providing a sinuous and cohesive thread of mobile tonality as opposed to the relatively more constrained tonal shifts of the harp due to its diatonic-based construction. The number three is also symbolic with its connection to navigation (triangulation). The programme of the voyage of discovery is as follows: the first movement symbolizes embarkation, initial excitement, determination, anticipation, progressive nostalgia. The second and most interiorised movement, which is really the heart of the work, represents dislocation, introspection, doubt, desperation, and the third movement represents discovery, arrival, celebration etc. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Flute Concerto was composed for flutist Alexa Still in 1993 while Ritchie was Composer - in - Residence with The Southern Sinfonia. Unlike the Symphony \"Boum\", written in the same year, this concerto is a generally happy and open-sounding work, and reflects aspects of Alexa Still's personality as well as her playing. She first performed the concerto on September 4th, 1993 in The Glenroy Auditorium, and subsequently recorded it with The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. The first movement is energetic in style, with a bubbling first theme. This is contrasted by a darker and slower second theme, exploring the lower register of the flute. The music accelerates back to the main theme before heading into a percussive middle section. The flute then presents a lyrical idea that is related to earlier themes, and this leads to a cadenza. A brief recapitulation drives the music to a forceful ending. The slow second movement is lyrical and improvisational in style, and begins with a solo for bass clarinet. A warm and gentle theme appears, followed by a short cadenza for flute. The orchestra returns with a fuller version of the theme, but it soon fades into anxious repeated chords on the oboes and bassoon while the flute plays nervous, flickering gestures. As the tension dissolves the clarinet introduces a laconic theme, interspersed with little cadenzas on the flute. The music builds to a climax where the main theme returns in a contrapuntal version, again fading into the anxious chords. A brief and mysterious coda contains references back to the opening cadenza, and the movement ends unresolved. The third movement is like a sequence of dances with different characters, bound together by a buffeting crotchet rhythm. After a flourish from the orchestra, the flute introduces a sprightly theme, followed by a quirky, subsidiary idea. The buffeting rhythm from the start is transformed into a pop-styled ostinato pattern, and the flute plays a lyrical melody above it. This theme was inspired by the composer attending a performance by The Muttonbirds, a well-known NZ rock group. The quirky theme returns in a more subdued setting, the music slows, and unexpectedly becomes a dreamy and child-like waltz. This distraction is swept away by a loud chord, and the main theme returns with renewed purpose, leading to an exciting conclusion in which all the elements of the movement are combined. The 'Flute Concerto' was recorded (in the orchestral version) by Alexa Still and the NZSO in 1996, on the Koch CD 3-7345-2-H1, entitled 'Kiwi Flute'. The second movement of the concerto was published in a special version for piano and flute by The Centre for NZ Music, in their 1998 publication 'Little Dancings: A Selection' of flute music by New Zealand Composers.

Each takes a text from the Afro-American tradition of spirituals and sets it in a style suggestive of that tradition. The other two works are �Sunday Morning Band� and �Witness for my Lord�. As with the other pieces written around the same time, the voicing here is aimed at developing choirs or choirs with limited resources � in this case three part male voices rather than the more common TTBB layout. A solo bass (or baritone) voice takes a significant role in the piece, with the choir parts remaining fairly repetitive from verse to verse. After a slightly slower introduction, the music is underpinned by a strongly rhythmic piano part throughout. The text talks of joining a band � the band of those who belong to God. There are references to typical images of the spirituals � the Jordan river, Joshua�s well-known battle, and Galilee. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: �faccee'� is composed as a set of loosely related, programmatic movements which portray different moods through the day. �faccee'� is intended as a lighter work of chamber music with elements of mystery, humor, charm and satire.  'Dawn' begins the work slowly, with the darkness and solitude of morning blossoming full fruit into daylight, then relaxing into the day.  Movement two, 'Boogie', quickens the pace and is akin to experiences while walking the streets of the city.  The further one travels, the more activity one encounters until reaching the heart of the city, where a rousing canon surrounds you with people and congested traffic. Then, suddenly, you arrive at your destination and with one last exclamation are in the door.  'Daydream' is a brief visit into the realm of nostalgia and sentiment, with a pleasant, recurring melody in the english horn and violin. What better for a finale than an old-fashioned 'galop' ? This �galop� is, rather, a musical pun on the Viennese version. The 'Galop' gives way to the 'Trio Satirico' which pokes fun at traditional trios with a duple/triple reconfiguration of  9/8; making for a gawky feel.  Then on to the 'Finale' where themes from earlier in the day are revisited in a whirlwind finish. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The entire thirty-day cycle has been used as one of the rhythmic generators of the piece, with vowels and consonants translated into durations to provide the apparently irrational rhythms, which are contrasted in a series of short ensemble or solo sections with either proportional or regular rhythms. The two longest sections are centrally placed. The first, featuring trombone and percussion, presents the language-based material in the percussion; the second, starting with the long piano solo, begins a mensural canon based on the proportional material. However, half-way through this canon, recapitulatory material begins, and subsequent appearances of the canon occur in continually shorter blocks, each transformed very differently. O Matenga, in the title of the piece, refers to the Maori custom, found also in many other civilisations, of providing sustenance for the spirit to the next world after death.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: A Touch of Paradise   3 This piece was written after a visit to friends Seng Poh Lee and Gary Martin, to whom the piece is dedicated.  A Touch of Paradise is the slogan of the real estate company for which Seng Poh works, and the piece tries to capture the peaceful serenity of the harbour-edge properties for sale.  The property in which the couple live is accessed by a deeply-rutted drive, and after its gentle beginning the music has a rather bumpy ride.  In fact, visits to the property are infrequent, as the couple are very busy people, and so the tick-tock of the clock becomes quite insistent as the music progresses.  Be Natural   6 It is sometimes thought that jazz and �classical� (�art�) music live in different worlds, and do not mix.  Composer George Gershwin showed that this is not true.  Here is a piece in standard ternary form, embodying traditional devices like sequence and hemiola, but clothed in syncopated rhythms and seventh chords typical of jazz music.  It is hoped that such a style will feel natural for jazz and classical pianists alike.  Chatterbox   9 This piece also reflects some influence from jazz, with some syncopation and an ambiguous major/minor tonality.  There is an element of informal speech, arising from the irregular rhythms and phrase lengths, and the frequent change of time signatures.  The staccato quavers suggest that the words are falling over themselves in hurry to get out of the speaker�s mouth.  In the middle section the chatter becomes quite a drone.  This drone hints at the presence of a musette, giving the piece something of an antique quality.  The presence of minor sevenths gives a modal feeling which suggests the renaissance.  The piece is dedicated to Kate McKinney and Kushlin Higgie, piano students who are themselves able composers.  The Haul of the Great Fish 10 In Maori legend the North Island is a great fish, hauled from the deep by fisherman Maui.  In this piece Maui struggles to raise the monster from the deep, and the rippling arpeggios, broken by sudden snags, testify to the difficulty of the task.  The rising melody in the treble indicates that the effort bears some success, and the strong C major chord at the end signifies that the labour is complete. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Specially written for Jean Cummings choir and as an �In Memoriam Bill Cumming� who was sadly run over by a young speadster in Christchurch in 2003. We got to know the Cummings on one of our first trips to Europe when the children were very young. They also had two children of much the same age (also a Fiona Jane!). At the time Bill said how he had been influenced by the painting and ideas of Paul Klee, whose work he�d got to know well through a course given by Michael Harlow. It was therefore appropriate to use texts by Michael in the piece, texts which are about Klee: 1. �Taking a line for a Walk� � elegiac  2. Bee-Bird (Bill?-Bird)� originally from 18 ways to Snatch a Bird 3. Chatter Bird � fast and light contrast � aslo from the �snatches� 4. A Shout � Valedictory and recapitulation of first song The first performance was originally to have been about the same time as the �reading� of the Rothko Variations and we would have visited Christchurch during this NZ trip to hear it but it was adjourned until early 2006 so we will miss it.

Comprising the virtuosic violinist Heliodoro Copado, Marcos Hern�ndez� extraordinary falsetto and the jarana guitar playing of Gregorio Solano, this trio sizzles to the words of a legendary trovador, Serapio El G�ero Nieto. Rhythmic sleights-of-hand twist an already complex argument of two against three into an intoxicating �journey to a foreign kingdom�. The words of each verse were extemporized, the last line of each repeated as the first of the next, in an endless chain of surreal connections. 'Snap' is a musical tourist�s album of this virtuosic performance.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Many developing and smaller choirs do not have sufficient male voices to form a full SATB choir, so there is a demand for works for mixed voices but with only one male voice line. This subsequent version for treble voices was made a few months after the original composition. The baritone part in the original is largely unchanged as the alto part in this version, although the piece has been transposed a tone higher. This piece sets a traditional Afro-American spiritual text in a lively setting. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The first version was written in 198] collectively with Andr� Fischer, a pupil at the Kantonsschule Z�rcher Unterland in B�lach. It is a setting of words from an advent calendar by Max Bolliger. It is scored for baritone soloist (Christophorus), children's chorus and wind orchestra, with percussion. The work was performed twice in December 1981. It tells the story of St. Christopher, a very strong man, who is searching for an ogre who rules the world. Each year, instead of finding the ogre, he finds a child in distress. In the eighth year, still searching, he meets Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem. During the night, when Jesus is born, the child speaks to him and says he has met the ogre seven times already. Christophorus now knows what the ogre is, but is much less sure of his ability to conquer lt. The characters of Christophorus and the children whom he meets are dressed in costume, but do not act. The Cantata is, however, illustrated by a series of slides which are shown during the whole performance. In 1982 in Christchurch I revised \"Christophorus\" and translated the text into English. It was performed for a season before Christmas of that year, with James Dames singing the part of Christophorus. This revised version has double wind, piano, organ and three percussionists, plus the children's chorus. A recording was made. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The title is taken from an essay by Fran�ois Bayle, which discusses the phenomenology of musical experience in richly poetic language. While not to be taken literally, this phrase reflects the play of energies in the music, and the transfer of energy between different regions, an evanescent surface, subject to unseen subterranean forces.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Every now and then the deputy musical directors of Auckland Choral Society are invited to jointly conduct a concert. In 1999 this took the form of a �subscriber�s bonus� concert, containing works requiring minimal accompaniment forces. Early discussions lead us in the direction of a Shakespeare-themed concert. In addition to conducting some American settings of Shakespeare, I decided to write a new cycle using Shakespearean texts. Given the nature of the intended concert, I wanted to write a work which was immediately approachable and contained an element of fun. My original intention was to compose a cycle based on references to flowers in Shakespeare�s writings, as I had a copy of a book which detailed them. However, it soon became apparent that many references were part of texts which were not suitable for a musical setting � some were conversational and others merely a passing mention of a flower. I broadened my scope a little and fashioned a sequence of seven texts which all refer in some way to things botanical and/or seasonal. The first text is from �As You Like It� and sets the well-known �It was a lover and his lass� in a jazzy idiom. A complete contrast of mood is presented in �Come, buy� from �The Winter�s Tale�, where the words detail a variety of items which might be purchased to charm a lady. The third piece is a short setting of �Hark, hark the lark� from �Cymberline�. Unlike Schubert�s well-known setting, this lark is rather boisterous and rowdy! The music owes more than a little to mid-twentieth century film music, perhaps a film involving a frenetic chase sequence! The centerpiece of the cycle is a setting of Shakespeare�s best-known sonnet �Shall I compare thee to a summer�s day?� (sonnet 18). Here the women�s voices are heard on their own, with the 2nd altos given a rare chance to take the limelight. The fifth piece is a reflective setting of �I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows� from �A Midsummer Night�s Dream�. Initially unison voices present the melody, breaking into harmony only for the second half of the song. Throwing caution to the wind, the sixth piece is a madcap, cartoonish setting of �When daisies pied� from �Love�s Labour�s Lost�. Where better to end the cycle than with the �flower-power� era of the 1960�s and a swinging version of �Under the greenwood tree� from �As You Like It�, using just about every harmonic clich� of the music of that time. �A Shakespeare Garland� was written for, and is dedicated to, Auckland Choral Society who gave the first performance.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Flute Concerto was composed for flutist Alexa Still (Principal flute, NZSO) in 1993 while Ritchie was Composer - in - Residence with The Dunedin Sinfonia.  Unlike the Symphony \"Boum\" , written in the same year, this concerto is a generally happy and open-sounding work, and reflects aspects of Alexa Still's personality as well as her playing. She first performed the concerto on September 4th, 1993 in The Glenroy Auditorium, and subsequently recorded it with The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.    The slow second movement is lyrical and improvisational in style, with two cadenzas at the start of the movement.  The first of these was scored for bass clarinet, but becomes a flute solo in the version for piano and flute.  In between these cadenzas a warm and gentle theme appears.  However, it soon fades into anxious repeated chords on the piano while the flute plays nervous, flickering gestures.  As the tension dissolves the piano introduces a laconic theme, interpersed with little cadenzas on the flute.  The music builds to a climax where the warm, gentle theme returns in a contrapuntal version, and again fades into the anxious piano chords.  A brief and mysterious coda contains references back to the opening cadenza, and the piece ends unresolved.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The keyboard introduction of �Clear Sky� captures the play of expansiveness (in the broad registral reach) and homeliness (the repeated motifs) that characterises the set as a whole.  In �The Picnic� the spacious quality of the keyboard, evoking the circling swallows in their easy flight, is tinged by a haunting iambic limp.  Lilburn�s word painting here is poignant and ironic:  vocal melismas depict the crumpled, curled foot of the one-footed gull, and our (short?) memories of his sorry sight.  �Summer Afternoon� sums up the ambivalent mood of the set.  The declamatory voice (also found in �The Picnic�) gradually becomes more lyrical, and a sense of progress is conveyed through the rising vocal line (as in �Clear Sky�).  Yet there is a lingering sadness.  The keyboard�s recurrent fluttering seventh and off-beat falling fourth recalls the desolation and troubling limp of �The Picnic�.  (Note by Nancy November).

He encouraged my interest in writing for the harpsichord, and in modal writing and turnings; he also gave a marvellous African-style performance on the little mbira (thumb-piano) from Cameroon that my wife had given me some years previously. The tuning of this instrument provided a scatter of eight notes oven two octaves; these eight notes form the basis of the modes used throughout the suite.  In the second and fourth movements, which are labelled Giuoco meaning play, I have also used the thumb-piano style of alternation hands and kept fairly literally to the instrument�s actual pitches. The other three movements oscillate between modes based on C and A throughout.

His improvising was recorded and edited into a 6-minute audio document, which was then transcribed. The transcription is a readymade of sorts, as it is taken from an extant object, and a counterfeit in that it points to a performance that never happened. Though not a risk in this instance - given that the piece is a forgery - a transcription should not efface its object but rather serve as a description through which to approach the original. Put another way, the performance of 'Untitled (Counterfeit Readymade #1)' can be located in relation to the original performance, the derived audio document and the transcription, while being none of these. The marimba part provides commentary on this mercurial object, drawing out and setting in relief its harmonic, melodic and rhythmic features, but rarely doubling it literally.

The chorale-like theme that emerges towards the end is based on my \"Te Puna Waiora\" (Spring of Living Water). Overall, \"Otari\" is shaped by some words in T.S. Eliot�s \"Four Quartets\":   \" At the still point, there the dance is..\" This work is dedicated to Carolyn Mills, principal harpist for the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, whose innovative and enthusiastic collaboration enabled me to explore some extended harp techniques as part of the composing process. In March 2005, \"Otari\" was premiered in U.S.A. and since then it has received several performances in New Zealand and theUnites States as well as at three international Harp Festivals -London, San Francisco and Adelaide.

Arapatiki translates (from the Maori language) as 'the way of the flounder', and is the ancient name  of the sand flats in front of my house at Harwood, near Dunedin. The piece has something to do with the advance and retreat of the tide across the flats, where many species of sea and water birds spend much of the day - an ever-varying water-scape. The opening idea is based on the song of the korimako or bellbird.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The model for the whole work is that of a museum in which some exhibits are on permanent display, and others are brought up from the storeroom. In other words, some sections of music are always to be played, while others are chosen by the performers from a pool of material to present a unique exhibition for each performance. The percussionist's instrumental collection is similarly assembled; some categories of instruments are specified while others are chosen by the percussionist with the added stipulation that some aspect of the instruments chosen must be unique to the location of the performance. The music of this particular \"exhibit\" alludes to, but does not use, folk-like material and is conceived as a playful sparring match between two friendly opponents.  'given what we gather takes place' was commissioned by Resonate Duo, to whom it is dedicated, with funding from Creative New Zealand. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The chosen texts are all by poets active in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and present varied views of the fashion of travelling, the reasons for a sea voyage, the plight of being in Rotterdam while your loved one is in England, and the place of the 'foreigner' in pre-twentieth century Japan. Musically, the work adopts a somewhat 'antiquated' style to match the tenor of the poems. The cycle ends with a reprise of the opening music. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: These pieces originated in a production of Shakespeare�s play undertaken in 1993 by Epsom Girls and Auckland Grammar Schools. I was asked to provide music for several scenes. As this production set the play in early twentieth century Sicily (with all of its Mafia overtones!) some of the music took on a distinctly Mediterranean flavour. The three pieces in this suite were used with important pieces of the action in the play. The first piece is the processional which was sung by the monks � the text being taken from the Latin �Te Deum�. The second piece was a setting of the �Ave Maria� sung during the wedding scene. The third piece was played by a small band on-stage during the ball scene, and suggests a lively tarantella. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The flax plant, and a cluster of related images, stand behind this piece. While not directly pictorial, it suggests flickering, swaying movement, and a fascination with dry, rustling sounds. These sounds and movements are not self-sustaining, but set in motion by the agency of air, of wind and, in this case, of human breath. These activating forces suggest echoes of the environments in which the plant grows. On another level of human agency, the place of flax as a raw material for intricately woven objects also intersects with the music. The piece is concerned with the relationship between the flute as an acoustical system and the human gestures by which its sounds are produced. The flute�s capacity for timbral modification, for the simultaneous manipulation of multiple aspects of the sound production, would seem to invite a sonically directed musical form. This approach encourages the instrument into unstable behaviours, as different, and sometimes conflicting performance gestures are superimposed, or placed in quick succession. I am deeply grateful to Bridget Douglas for her close collaboration in the making of the piece. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Once I reached this text, I decided the music and even the text itself didn�t suit the larger work, so I extracted this as a separate work.  �Tama ngakau marie� is a well-known traditional hymn in the Maori language, and is widely sung in New Zealand. The text is a prayer for deliverance from evil and request for God�s love. It has a somewhat solemn tune, and the exact origin of the text is obscure. My setting is in a simple tonal style but with frequent changes between three and four beats in the bar. The first verse features a solo voice which returns later singing a descant above the main melody. The work was finally completed in late 2001 and first performed at Epsom Girls Grammar School�s senior prizegiving of that year. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Romance for Clarinet and Piano' was written in 1971 and performed at a band concert in Epsom Girls Grammar School (Auckland) in 1972 - the soloist being a talented young clarinet player, Anne Ruddy, from Papatoetoe High School. Both clarinet and piano parts, technically, are able to be played by good high school players, but the style of the music demands some use of rubato (ie. flexible tempi) and a \"cadenza-like\" freedom in the short unaccompanied passages for the clarinet.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In 1995 I was approached by the NZSO to write an overture to commemorate the recent death of New Zealand's most famous war hero, Sir Charles Upham. Upham was famous for having won the Victoria Cross twice for bravery during World War II. He was, however, extremely modest when it came to discussing his achievements. Some years before his death it was suggested to Upham that he have a state funeral; he simply replied \"A bugle will do\". This comment seemed like a good starting point for my piece. There are no bugles in the orchestra, but the opening section depicting the horrors of battle contains plenty of brass. Sub-titled 'Maleme and Ruweisat Ridge', the music is fast and furious, built from several motifs, and includes the opening rhythm for the most well known Maori haka (war dance), 'Kamate, kamate'. The music builds to a climax, and the scene changes to a bleak Colditz Castle, where Upham was imprisoned during the war. While in prison he dreams of rural NZ, and the farm near Kaikoura called 'Landsdowne', where he eventually settled after the war. This brief pastoral section links into a coda celebrating the outbreak of peace. Motifs from earlier in the piece return but changed into brighter modes. 'A Bugle Will Do' was first performed by the NZSO in 1996 under Andrew Sewell, and was subsequently performed in the USA. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: One winter morning, a short walk from the marae at Waihi, on the southern shore of  Lake Taupo, I stood on the shore to watch the sun rise. Behind me, a waterfall lead to a small stream that flowed into the lake, imposing its own patterns on those of the lake. The water was uniformly grey, but as the sun rose, for a moment the tops of the ripples were golden, with darker valleys between, before the whole area was flooded with light. So the ideas behind this trio have to do with the changing perspectives of patterns in water - in the bubbling of streams, the tumble of a waterfall, in the spiralling eddies where stream meets lake at sunrise.  In the opening movement, a group of short themes and ideas initially form a mosaic-like section, which recurs in developed and varied forms around more reflective passages. The second movement reverses the first, in that slow, sustained sections are interrupted by more energetic material, and the final movement draws all the previous ideas together.  The first performance by the New Zealand Trio, who commissioned the piece with financial assistance from Creative New Zealand, took place at the Mills Reef Winery in Tauranga in July, 2005.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The \"Great Harbour of Tara\" is a tone poem about Wellington. A conductor's score and fully edited parts are available. The work starts with atmosphere - waves lapping very gently on Petone beach and the tinkle of sand . The main theme sounds on the Fr. Horn then the music builds and eventually a reference is made to the old whaling days followed by a storm (a characteristic of Cook Strait - the infamous 'Southerly') building to hurricane force strength. The storm also alludes to the sinking of the Waihini in the '60s. An elegy for strings follows in honour of the victims of that disaster. The mood gradually changes to calm acceptance and on to an optimistic view of Wellington's future, a big, full tutti . The work closes with the atmosphere of sand, surf and evening.

The music of �A West Irish Ballad� follows the course of an anonymous Irish poem, and is influenced by Irish traditional music.  Much of the musical imagery comes from the poetry, from the snipe and the �lonely bird in the woods�, to the developing ostinato reminiscent of church bells, and to the broader feeling of the landscape as I imagine it, and the deep emotion of Irish laments and love songs. �A West Irish Ballad� was written for the Sydney Chamber Choir.

It is a single movement work based on material from the opera 'At the Hawk's Well'. In some cases there has been extensive reworking, affecting also its construction which follows an arch form with a lively opening and closing. 'Symphonic Poem' was given a workshop reading by the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Sir William Southgate in 1994. This event was recorded by Radio New Zealand's Concert FM. It was also performed by the New Zealand Secondary School's Symphony Orchestra in 1995 as part of its Auckland Course. Peter Adams wrote of the work in a review for the Otago Daily Times (August 1, 1994): \"Nigel Keay's 'Ritual Dance of the Unappeasable Shadow' made a powerful impact on first hearing; the dark core of the work had a brooding intensity while the flanking outer sections were vital and colourful with their Indonesian gamelan-inspired sound world.\"  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

'Interludes' is a brief, freely evolving abstract piece with a somewhat improvisational feel to it, and is concerned with splashes of harmonic colour across the keyboard in the context of sinuous angular melodic fragments, hence the suggestion of the pointillistic aspect to the work. 'Interlude for Piano' was commissioned by Judith Clark on behalf of the Wellington Branch of the Institute of Registered Music Teachers. It was written for the IRMT conference in Nelson in January 1988 and the piece was given its first performance by Mark Secker at the Nelson School of Music.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In composing this concerto I recognise two contrasting musical cultures within the European artistic tradition. The Brass Band represents what I call a 'closed' musical system portrayed by its standardised instrumentation heard to great effect in its stirring marches, sonorous hymn playing, contest pieces and arrangements of popular and show music,  while the orchestra  with its dazzling array of many instrumental colours, its flexible instrumentation and its potential for pushing musical boundaries, represents an 'open' musical system.   I wanted also to exploit the virtuosic capacity of the brass band as a concerto soloist and to celebrate through this work the unity and solidarity amongst brass musicians. 'Europa' is a one movement work in five main sections which alternate slow atmospheric music with a fast and rhythmic style. The latter is heard in the many rapid passages which switch from band to orchestra and vice versa. Noteable also is the relationship between the band and the orchesta particularly in the cadenzas for the brass band followed by the orchestral brass. I was spurred into composing this work after reading about Europa, one of the large moons of the planet Jupiter first seen by Galileo in 1610 and named after a goddess of Greek mythology. Such thoughts were instrumental in generating my first musical ideas, for instance the name 'Europa' is represented by a six note melody heard throughout the work. However, my initial thoughts about Europa receeded as I explored and developed the musical material. 'Europa'  was commissioned by the Auckland Philharmonia. The work was first performed by the Dalewool Auckland Brass and the Auckland Philharmonia conducted by Miguel Harth-Bedoya on 13 June 2002 in the Auckland Town Hall.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Music plays with time in so many ways - bending it, compressing it, folding it, expanding it...  What role can silence play in this game of temporal illusion?  Apart from its obvious potential as a kind of temporal/sonic punctuation, breaking up the apparently continuous flow of time, silence is pregnant with the potential for reflection - reflection on what has come before and on what may be yet to come.  Taken to an extreme, silence can introduce a kind of entropy into a piece - a long silence can fracture a piece so severly that it functions as an open door, inviting the listener to wander off, away from the world of the composer. But silence is much more than just the absence of sound.  It has a ritualistic aspect.  Think of the minute of silence dedicated to the dead, think of the silence of meditation and prayer that takes us beyond the noise and continuity of quotidian existence.  Perhaps music can be a metaphor for silence on this level.  Perhaps the whole musical work can function as an extended metaphorical silence interrupting our everyday concerns, inviting reflection, turning down the internal dialogue and fading out the conceptual grid.

The first, an allegro, is in sonata form, and features nervous, darting ideas which become more animated in the middle section.   The second movement opens with a chorale-like theme, expressing feelings of nostalgia.  The fidgety middle section builds up more tension, before being combined with the chorale theme.   The finale releases the tensions of the earlier movements, and has a happy, sunny character.  Initially inspired by a Beethoven sonata, the rondo theme builds up to a big climax before ending quietly.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The first stirrings of this piece coincided with the birth of my second child. So it may be heard as a small gesture of welcome. However, as often happens, musical development overtook any outward metaphorical expression, and I find myself scrabbling around afterwards to link the music to something beyond itself. The title is a phrase from Bill Manhire�s poem, �What to Call Your Child�, chosen for its intrinsic resonance, rather than any link to its original context. The child�s name is encoded in the music, not so much for its meaning, but for the tension generated when spontaneous composition is disrupted by the intrusion of arbitrary elements. Connections between the musical materials and images of growth, development, and disruption, and the natural environment mentioned in the title, can no doubt be found, but don�t take my word for it. Or, as Samuel Beckett put it, �What a rest to speak of bicycles and horns.� Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This short cycle of five pieces presents setting of poems about five birds familiar to New Zealanders: ruru (the morepork), the seagull, the moa, the kingfisher and the kiwi. The poems are by Marion Rego, James K. Baxter, Jon Gadsby, Eileen Duggan, and Peter Hawes. The texts are mostly lighter in tone although the first and fourth present a little more of the serious side of the daily battle for survival in the wild. At the very end of the final piece, the spotlight is turned on the audience! The music also aims to be immediately appealing and enjoyable, both to perform and to listen to. The first, third and fifth settings are for mixed-voice choir, while the second and fourth are set for treble voices. Both these pieces originated in works written for my choirs at Epsom Girls Grammar School. �A New Zealand Aviary� was commissioned by the Waikato branch of the NZ Choral Federation for a combined choirs sing in May 2001. The first performance featured choirs from the Waikato region conducted by the composer. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The winning pieces (of which mine was not one) were then published in an album by Zen-On.  In my meditation the BACH motif is arranged over four white notes of the piano (B-A-D-C). This gives the piece a more relaxed and modal flavour.

The theme of roses and some of the texts were chosen by Viva Voce's conductor, John Rosser. The eight songs deal in a fairly light way with a variety of aspects of that most romantic of flowers, from love and happiness through to suffering, pain and death. Edmund Waller's 'Go, lovely rose' is a characteristic idealisation of a young woman and is romantic in style. In Herrick's 'To the Rose', the rose is used to entrap a lover and force her to submit, and the music reflects this cruelty. Dorothy Parker suggests roses are all very well but she would have preferred a new car from her lover. The final song is an arrangement of James Oppenheim's suffragette song 'Bread and Roses', and recalls the the sweated labour of women from the past. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

The details of the first performance are unknown; the first performance I heard was by Anna Klymashivka in Sydney in 1996. The pieces perhaps suggest nature images, but the only one that was a reaction to something specific is the last, which was suggested by watching and hearing a beck in spate (or flooded stream) on the west coast of Scotland.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Bele Doette ('Lovely Doette') is based on an anonymous 12th century Chanson de Toile. The vocal line follows the original song-line closely for two of the eight stanzas and refrains.  Doette is at a window, reading, when she receives the news that her friend Doon has been killed in a jousting contest.  The refrain reads \"See now what grief I have\", and at the end she vows to become a nun in the church of St Paul.  The original transcription of the song is published in the Anthology of Medieval Music, edited by Richard Hoppin (1978). Pitches are notated in the transcription but no rhythm. Therefore, rhythm is freely interpreted while the original melismas and word setting are maintained.  The refrain is expanded beyond the original.  The oboe has a dual role. First, it freely develops motifs based on the song-lines by a process using magic squares.  These motifs are used in the introduction and interludes between stanzas and refrains. Second, the oboe has a dialogue with the soprano that involves imitation and decoration, particularly in the refrains.  Bele Doette was commissioned by Pepe Becker, and written for her and oboist, Robert Orr. It has been composed as part of Ritchie's research at the University of Otago.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This short work began as part of �Crux fidelis� written early in 2001 on a commission from Diocesan School for Girls, Auckland. Once I reached this text, I decided the music and even the text itself didn�t suit the larger work, so I extracted this as a separate work.  �Tama ngakau marie� is a well-known traditional hymn in the Maori language, and is widely sung in New Zealand. The text is a prayer for deliverance from evil and request for God�s love. It has a somewhat solemn tune, and the exact origin of the text is obscure. My setting is in a simple tonal style but with frequent changes between three and four beats in the bar. The first verse features a solo voice which returns later singing a descant above the main melody. The work, originally written for SSA choir, was finally completed in late 2001 and first performed at Epsom Girls Grammar School�s senior prizegiving of that year. This version for SATB was made in 2002 at the request of my former colleague Mary Siew.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Since my first setting of Jack Prelutsky�s poetry in 1996 (�The Dragons are Singing Tonight� for choir and brass band) I�ve returned to his texts frequently. Although this American author is best-known as a writer of poetry for children, his humorous verses appeal to all ages, and he is one of the most widely anthologized poets around. �Monday�s Troll� is a companion set to his dragon poems. The poems are not a cycle in the sense of telling a connected story, but they do explore different aspects of the subject at hand: trolls, wizards, goblins, giants and ogres. For this initial set of pieces I�ve selected four of the poems. The first echoes the well-known children�s rhyme which begins �Monday�s child is fair of face��. The second is Bellow the ogre telling us all about himself, and features the men�s voices prominently. The third piece allows the women�s voices to take the limelight and is a short lullaby sung by a mother ogre to her young one. The final piece details the lives of seven grubby goblins who take great delight in their rather unpleasant lifestyle. �Monday�s Troll� features a solo bass clarinet in a kind of concertante role. It could be thought of as the voice of the various characters in the pieces. The work was commissioned by Christchurch Symphony Orchestra for their 2002 Proms concert with funding from Creative New Zealand. �Monday�s Troll� was first performed on 9th November 2002 by the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra and Christchurch City Choir, with Gretchen Dunsmore (bass clarinet), conducted by Marc Taddei.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Markheim is a man at the end of his tether. What started as a robbery gone wrong has ended in a murder � a murder that seems certain to force him to kill once more. And then kill again. Trapped, he is made to confront circumstances that have brought him to this terrible crisis. Just at the moment a mysterious stranger appears � but it soon becomes clear that this saviour is not all he seems. Is he the devil driving to further temptation and inevitable damnation? Or an angel come to save him from himself? Loosely based on R. L. Stevenson�s macabre story, Markheim, a haunting story of guilt and redemption, Good Angel and Bad Angel is a chamber opera for three voices and four instrumentalists.   SYNOPSIS: The opera opens in an old curio-shop where the owner and his daughter are having a row. She feels unappreciated by her miserly father and says she�d prefer to spend Christmas Day with someone who cares for her � her boyfriend. She storms out leaving the old man to his gold and silver. A knock at the shop door. The shopkeeper is reluctant to open, but realising it could be a potential customer, lets in the caller. It is Markheim, a small time thief. He claims he wants to buy a Christmas present for his girlfriend. The old man shows him his stock. When the old man�s back is turned Markheim kills him. Believing that there is a hoard of gold hidden somewhere in the shop, Markheim is now free to look for it. Another knock at the door. Two drunks are wanting to visit the old man. Markheim doesn�t answer and tries not to panic. Finally the drunks wanter off. Quite unexpectedly, a complete stranger � the visitant � enters from the back of the shop. He offers to tell Markheim where the gold is hidden. Fearing the unknown Markheim refuses to answer. The visitant tells him the old man�s daughter is coming back to the shop to apologise for her outburst. If Markheim is still here when she arrives, he will have to kill the daughter as well to cover his crime. A dialogue follows with Markheim realising more and more the hopelessness of his position. The visitant keeps reminding him that the daughter will be arriving very soon. Markheim insists the money will allow him to start a new life and in a high dramatic solo passage declares that freedom is within his grasp. The murder is one-off, he claims � and from now on his life will be on the straight and narrow. A knock at the door. It is the daughter. The visitant says Markheim will have to let her in. Then he will have to kill her. Markheim opens the door and tells her that her father is dead. At first she thinks the old man collapsed and that the doctor has been called. Then Markheim shows her the knife. Realising what has happened she sings a moving lament for her father and begs for her life. The powerful trio that follows is interrupted by a knock at the door. It will be her boyfriend. The girl starts to scream for help. For Markheim this is the end. Or perhaps a new beginning.   Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

Ray was born in England and lived through seven years of destruction, spending many nights in air raid shelters listening to the sounds of total war. An air raid, with its sirens, the drone of bombers, bombs dropping and anti-aircraft fire can be heard in the first movement. The main theme, which occurs soon after the opening, reappears inverted after the air raid - symbolic of the utter chaos prevelant at that time. However, like the Phoenix rising from the ashes, the theme not only corrects itself but changes from minor to major modality near the end. The second movement represents New Zealand with its bitter-sweet memories for the composer. New Zealand is a beautiful country. The humerous third movement, called \"England again\" is scored pizzicato throughout, and leads to the final movement \"Canada\" - big Canada, magnificent Canada, vast Canada, noble Canada, free Canada, beautiful Canada.... the huge but simple harmonies near the end are Ray's interpretation of the optimism he feels for the country.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This song cycle was written for noted young Taiwanese baritone Lin Chung Guang. The songs are all from an anthology of poetry about the night. Each of the selected texts explores a facet of the hours of darkness, ranging from the spiritual to the amorous. The final lines of the final song encapsulate the ideas behind the cycle: ��pondering the themes thou lovest best: night, sleep, death and the stars.� The first two songs are translations of poems by Else Lasker Sch�ler (1869-1945). The first is a prayer, but with a bitter edge to it. The second is a love song. The middle song of the cycle sets one of the best-known poems by Irish poet W.B. Yeats (1865-1939). This is another love song, set here in the ecstatic key of F sharp major. The fourth song is by Robert Hillyer (1895-1961), and uses musical imagery to paint a picture of the sounds of the night. The final song is by American poet Walt Whitman (1819-1892), and in its brief text sets forth some of what happens to one�s thoughts at midnight. Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

'Dancing in the Snake Pit' depicts a snake-charmer, who begins his bold recitative and stirs to life the inhabitant of a deep pit.  Slowly the snake awakens from his slumber, and starts to move to the gentle undulating rhythm.  Little by little, as the snake-charmer weaves his spell, the snake begins to dance: hesitantly at first, but growing bolder and stronger until its rapid movements coincide with the charmer's hypnotic and rhythmic dance.  Suddenly a bell is heard softly in the distance.  The snake grows weary of the dance; he crawls back into the darkness, and sleeps.  Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

  general_note: ""
  internal_note: "Programme Note: The three movements of the symphony are:  I - 'Stratagem of Trumpets'  III - 'Mi-1st'  IIII - 'Double Helix'    \"Turning and turning in the widening gyre  The falcon cannot hear the falconer;  Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  Mere anarchy is loosed on the world . . .\"   from \"The Second Coming\" by W. B. Yeats   When asked to compose a work on the meaning and symbolism of the new Millenium I decided to use William Butler Yeats' famous poem \"The Second Coming\" as a starting point.  Written in 1921, when the old order in Europe was breaking down, it suggests a revolution or rotation in history (the gyre) will bring about a 'second coming' of an important historical figure, and the dawn of a new Millenium.  Yeats' vision of the new world order to come is not, however, optimistic.  He sees the coming of a 'rough beast' with a 'lion body and the head of a man', a cold and heartless creature that might be equated with certain infamous and autocratic leaders in the 20th century.   The 'gyre' or revolution is represented in the symphony by a rolling, sliding timpani sound, accompanied by bass drum and tam tam at the start of the work.  This idea becomes an important motif and appears at the very start.  Following the 'gyre', we hear a 'life and death' theme that begins like a cradle song (the birth of Christ), rises, and then twists downwards in a chromatic line.  This theme provides most of the material for what follows.   The slow introduction climaxes with hammer blows, a reference to the death of Christ. From this a trumpet call emerges, becoming a significant motif later in the movement.   In the allegro that follows, the 'life and death' theme is transformed into a fast and restless melody, beginning as pizzicato on the strings.  Complimenting this is a macabre and folky theme on muted trumpet and clarinets, evoking a sort of frenzied, gyrating dance.  The music quietens and a lyrical theme appears on flute, accompanied by timpani and harp and developed by the strings.  As the music climaxes again, the trumpet call reappears, shared around other brass instruments.  The significance of this trumpet call can be seen with reference to another poem, this time by New Zealander Peggy Dunstan:   Stratagem of Trumpets   \"Then the trumpets sounded  Not in a flare of pomp and pageantry  But with a golden lilting laughter  That seemed to open up the sky  So that the music dropped like rain  Upon the upturned faces  And the enchanted ears were closed  To everything except those throbbing notes. . . \"   The trumpets distract the listeners, and make them unaware of the advancing enemy.  Dunstan's poem goes on to describe a massacre of Serbs in 1389 at the time of the battle of Kosovo between Serbs and Turks.  At the time of composing my symphony Kosovo was once again in the grip of war and atrocity, only this time the Serbs were the aggressors and Albanians were the victims.  It seems to me that Kosovo sums up a situation common in our past Millenium: an endless cycle of struggle for land and power, costing many innocent lives.   In the music, the log drum heralds a sort of 'musical battle-field' in which the 'life and death' theme becomes an aggressive, jagged idea, used fugally in an increasingly dissonant texture.  Following the 'battle', solo strings, piccolo and harp provide a brief lament for the dead and the music returns to the music of the Introduction.  This time it is mixed fragments of the flute theme, and the movement ends quietly with the 'gyre' motif.   If the first movement represents the past, then the second movement is a comment on the present.  The title 'Mi-1st' refers to the heavy emphasis on the note E (or Mi in the sol-fa system) as a central pitch, but can also be interpreted as 'me-first'.  Essentially this music is about the natural human tendency to be self-centred, which I believe has become much more prevalent in our own society.  It is perhaps one aspect of Yeats' 'rough beast' that hinders our progress.   There are three main ideas in this presto movement.  The first is a savage chromatic theme that encircles the note E, played initially on strings. It is immediately followed by a vigorous, syncopated theme on strings and winds.  As a contrast, the harp accompanies a quieter, smoother theme on the violins, which also includes the twisting, chromatic motif from the first movement.  In the middle, the music becomes increasingly chaotic until a climax on C is reached, with hope for resolution to the discords.  However, the music slips into the key of B, and the strings play a restless, anxious version of the contrast theme.  The frenetic energy of the first part gradually dissipates, and the movement collapses into a web of solo violins.  The 'gyre' motif has the final say.   There are a number of themes in the third movement, but all evolve in some way or other from the constantly twisting, turning melodic line that appears at the start.  Used in close canon, this melody represents the intertwining DNA molecule, and hence the title of the movement, 'Double Helix'.  Discovered recently in our history, genetics are sure to have a highly significant role in the future.  This music looks forward with the hope that genetics will be used in a positive way.  It also acknowledges that we carry with us the characteristics of previous generations (covering a whole Millenium and more!), and that the future will be significantly shaped by these characteristics. At the same time we need to learn from the hard lessons of previous generations in order to make progress.  Consequently, the symphony has an optimistic and celebratory end, which is tempered by a sense of warning.  In the coda, the threads of 'Double Helix' motifs are combined with a return of the main theme from the first movement, played on full brass.   Dedicated to Sandy   Edition:  Biblio Note:  Sample:

In the piano version, Lilburn incorporates idiomatic guitar gestures into accompaniment throughout:  strumming, broken chords, and fading guitar snaps.  These serve not only to evoke the guitar, but also to strengthen one�s sense of the songs as self-reflective, self-accompanied cycle of �songs within songs�.  Lilburn subsequently arranged the cycle for tenor and guitar (1953, SLD-47), and for tenor and piano(1954, EC-26). "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: (Letter to Tom Bayliss) This small orchestra version IS the original 1953 scoring that was recorded for the NZ Players to take on tour. In that recording we used a �harpsichordized� piano (sheets of newspaper over grand piano strings) to give an extra �edge� to the sound; you'll see the Waiteata score says �piano or harpsichord�, and it has been performed with harpsichord.  In writing the dances, I followed the play-script for the second act, keeping to regular 8-bar dance formulas and asking the director, Richard Campion, for approximate durations for each dance; (his original estimations usually turned out to be much too short!). Only one dance, the Tango, was danced on stage; here my wife-to-be, Raydia d'Elsa, helped me by going through the steps and fitting in the dialogue."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Lilburn composed these songs in 1958 for the baritone Donald Munro and his wife the violist Jean McCartney, who gave the first broadcast performance.  The influence of serialism on the composer�s style at this point in his career makes for a challenging vocal line, especially in the first two songs.  Nonetheless, Lilburn�s work capitalizes on the affinities between voice and viola, and exploits technical capabilities of the viola to evoke moods rather than painting the words.  In the penultimate verse of �Warning of Winter�, for example, the viola�s wavering line, thickened with chords, heralds the darkness of winter that �descends the flowered pathway�.  Such subtle evocation of the text is also found in �Blow, Wind of Fruitfulness�.  Here the viola�s wide leaps to high trills are to be executed with the bow placed over the fingerboard; this evokes the troubling paradoxes of spring, the �Birds that are silent now/And buds of barren springing�.  Between these bleak poles, the viola and voice pairing are used with bold irony in �Song of Allegiance�.  This march is a poet�s humble yet robust reflection on his own position in comparison to the poetic geniuses of the past.  Again Lilburn enlists the viola to speak with and as the poet: wide intervals, tense chords, and motivic stutters convey a poetic voice that is �cracked and harsh�."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The drama and poetry of traditional Scots ballads have a universal appeal, but particularly for a com poser who (like many New Zealanders) has Scots ancestry. King Orfeo is unusual in that it is based on the Greek legend of Orpheus, who now plays the bagpipes rather than the lute; and doubly usual in that it has a happy ending with Orfeo rescuing his Isabel. The other two ballads are more typical in their themes of darkness and death. Lord Randal's story is told in dialogue with his mother; it is interesting that another dialogue-ballad, Edward, was set by Schubert towards the end of his life. These settings also exist in a version for voice and orchestra"

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This piece was written in 1975 when Allan Thomas first brought his Cirebon gamelan to Victoria University. I encouraged a composition class to join in learning how to play the various instruments involved, and then to write something of their own as an exercise in modal composition. Also to see if they could come up with something that worked in a non-traditional-Javanese way. having a go at doing such a piece myself was part of the encouragement. In the end, only one student and I finished our pieces!  My Ostinato, while taking into account the gamelan instruments and their colours, is a sort of \"process\" piece that could also be adapted for other timbres. Basically the process is a shrinking canon. The theme, first played by the kenong, is imitated six beats later by the bonang. With each repeat of this the theme gets louder and the canonic imitation a beat closer until at the climax they paly together. The other gamelan instruments provide background ostinati throughout, and at the end join in the final echo cadence. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: �Sings Harry�, a setting of six poems by Denis Glover, tells of an endearingly idiosyncratic New Zealander.  It is a prime example of Lilburn�s subtle handling of poetic texts.  The self-reflective tone of the protagonist, and the slightly complex narrative mode, are established in the first song:  it is Harry�s voice that we hear, Harry singing his home-made song cycle; yet a guiding narrator is ever present to tells us so.  One�s awareness of this narrative voice is enhanced throughout the cycle by the recurrent falling-third motif at the phrase �sings Harry�, and by the composer�s frequent use of a vocal reciting tone or a pitch to which the voice is drawn.  It is nonetheless easy to become absorbed in the various voices of Harry, which range from the crusty critic to the carefree swaggerer.  Lilburn captures the fluctuating temporality and unpredictability of his subject with great sensitivity and humour.  In the final song, a delightful recollective melange of landscapes and uncles, this is achieved by means of recurrent motifs (the �river running by�) and reflective pauses.    �Sings Harry� was released in 1960 on a label called Kiwi New Zealand Composer Edition.  It was the third work by Lilburn to be recorded and the sole piece on a 45 rpm disc. Programme note: Nancy November"

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The first movement opens quietly with a number of ideas in which the melodic interval of a fifth has some prominence. A faster section follows and the development of these ideas leads to climaxes with patterns of diverse rhythms superimposed.  After the final climax the movement subsides to a quiet ending. The second movement has the character of a Scherzo. Lively  rhythms alternating between 6/8 and 3/4 lead to a quieter sustained \"trio\" tune. The scherzo resumes and takes the music to a climax where these two ideas are presented together - the faster one (violins and trumpets) across the slower (horns and trombones). The music unwinds until we are left with a fragment of the slower theme, which becomes a link to the third movement. The finale has the form of a free passacaglia. It grows out of the opening trumpet tune and its accompaniment - the trumpet tune becomes the passacaglia bass, while the stepwise bass takes over as melody. At the end of the movement a reference back to the melodic falling fifths of the first movement leads to the final chord - fading from brass to wind, and in the end, to strings alone. (Programme note by Owen Jensen on the sleeve of the 1969 Kiwi/Pacfic LP recording by the NZSO under Juan Matteucci)"

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Whitehead has always had an affinity with the music of the sixteenth century � for three years she sang in Peter Godfrey�s choir at St. Mary�s Cathedral in Auckland, where the repertoire included Byrd�s four part mass. This experience meant that the writing of this work came naturally. Written while studying in Wellington, the Mass is one of the first of her works that Gillian heard performed; the Victoria University choir conducted by Robert Oliver sang selected movements, while its first complete performance, in an otherwise �all Bach� concert by the Leonine Consort in Sydney, was broadcast on television.  The reviewer of this concert, Roger Covell, wrote �Gillian Whitehead�s Missa Brevis easily rose to the challenge of justifying its presence� (showing) rare understanding of how to write for concerted voices; everything she calculated on paper worked in practice in this tenderly beautiful performance�.  (Programme note by Emma Carle and Jack Body)."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Beginnings' was commissioned by The Auckland Philharmonia. It was inspired by the birth of Ritchie's son Tristan. It depicts the slowly mounting tension of the labour, through to the birth itself. There is a gradual growth in the music from small, delicate gestures into wild and pulsating ones towards the end. The child is represented by a 'little Tristan waltz' which eventually gets caught up in the musical frenzy. The waltz sequence imposes order on the music, which tends to be fragmentary and changeable. There are some echoes of Bartok and Debussy in this early work, and it presents a good challenge for a professional orchestra. "

The two main themes were originally written by the Composer as sound tracks for television commercials, and reworked and developed for this overture.   The influence of film music is very evident in the orchestral scoring, with long sweeping melodies visualizing the wide open spaces and the modern rhythms of today's 'pop' music.  Youth of Auckland  has been recorded several times for CD and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra's version is played regularly on New Zealand National Radio. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: During 1983 Epsom Girls Grammar School and Auckland Grammar School undertook a co-production of Shakespeare�s �Othello�, for which I was asked to compose incidental music. The producer gave me a free hand with my approach to the score, and the 12 musicians played about half an hour�s music during the play. One aspect of �Othello� that appealed was the fact that three songs had to be set to music - the 2 drinking songs in Act 2, and the well-known �Willow Song� in Act 4. I knew from the time I had been asked to compose the music that I didn�t want to write �pseudo-Elizabethan� music. Hence, the first drinking song is a �blues� number, and the second a lively setting containing constant time signature changes. In this arrangement for SSATB voices I have used the drinking songs to frame the �Willow Song� - a gentle and reflective setting featuring the melody mainly in the alto part."

The texts are from a collection of writings (both poetry and prose) associated with each age from birth to 99 years old. The selection I made was purely of those items which appealed to me personally - some are humorous, others more serious, some cynical whereas others contain wisdom. \"From Age to Age Endure\" was commissioned by Auckland Youth Choir, and is affectionately dedicated to them and their conductor at the time, Brigid McLafferty. I was asked to write a work with jazz influences, and although not a great jazz fancier, I hope I have created a work which is fun to sing and enjoyable to listen to. The work is scored for solo soprano, SATB choir and small ensemble (or piano duet)."

Throughout, I have sought to evoke a mood of stillness and calm (except at the two main climaxes), and much of the writing consists of simple diatonic chords alternating between the two choirs. The work ends, as it began, alternating the words 'canta' and 'luna'. The unusual scoring came about through my friendship with a fine horn player and singer - a flippant comment about unorthodox combinations of forces (although I have heard one other work for horn and choir) providing the germ of idea which eventually did bear fruit. �The Moon is Silently Singing� is one of my most widely preformed works internationally, having been heard in Australia, Canada, Germany, England and the USA. It is scheduled for publication by Walton Music in 2004."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Widow's Songs (2004) consist of three settings of poems by Cilla McQueen, taken from her cycle of poems called 'Rope'. They attempt to describe thoughts and feelings of a woman grieving for her dead husband.  In the process, surrounding images and activities seem to take on extra meaning.  In the second song, for example, making bread becomes too difficult to do because of the memories it stirs.  The style of the songs is intimate and aims to exploit the beauty of the voice to evoke feelings.  Widow's Song is one of several works by Ritchie inspired by Cilla McQueen's poems, including an opera called The Trapeze Artists and the well-known song Dogwobble.  These songs were commissioned by Tower NZ Youth Choir, for performance by the a capella chamber choir, Tower Voices New Zealand. It was written for a premiere performance in the Otago Arts festival, October, 2004. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This music was originally commissioned by Richard Campion for the New Zealand Players' production of �Ring Round the Moon� by Jean Ahhouil, translated by Christopher Fry. In the second act there is a ball taking place offstage and demanding a large number of dances which are specified in the text. The music was first recorded on acetate discs by a ad hoc orchestra led by Alex Lindsay; these small recordings were then played through speakers for the production, sounding very loud to the cast but filtering out more gently to the audience. At the end of the long national tour, the cast know the music very well and suggested to me that I should do something with it. The result, some years later, 1957, was a suite of nine dances first performed by the Alex Lindsay Orchestra.  This rapidly became my most performed piece and was commercially recorded by the Alex Lindsay Orchestra in the 1960s, a recording still available today from Kiwi Pacific Reords. Ashley Heenen, through the NZ APRA Committee, commissioned an arrangement for full orchestra for the NZ Youth Orchestra to take on a tour of Europe and China in 1975. This version was shortened to six dances by leaving out the first three numbers. The music has also been used for a ballet, The Wintergarden, choreographed by Arthur Turnbull for the Royal New Zealand Ballet Company - this version included a tenth dance not in the 1957 Suite. Since 1975 two further version have been commissioned: Waltz Suite (1989), for string orchestra (five dances) for the Nova Strings, and an arrangement of the original Dance Suite� (1992) for violin and piano (nine dances) for Isador Saslav.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Hanging Bulb was commissioned by The Dunedin Sinfonia while the composer was Mozart Fellow at Otago University.   It consists of a continuous movement, divided into four sections: slow, fast, slow, fast.  Sections 1 and 2 are thematically related, as are sections 3 and 4, so the structure could be described as a double couplet.   The work expresses particular emotional and psychological states of mind, encapsulated in the title of the work which is an image of despair.  Hanging light bulbs have been associated with despair and obsession in the world of art and in the real world.  They became a significant image to the composer at the time of writing this piece, which was not born in happy circumstances. Tension in the music is created through extensive use of the octatonic scale, bi-modal effects and thickly layered chords (such as occur near the end).  The xylophone and bass drum are used as symbols of cruelty, while the piano has an important 'personal'statement in the first section.  The last section has an obsessional quality which is expressed through repeated rhythms and motifs.   A music resource for secondary schools is available for this work from SOUNZ. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: For the composer, 'Fantasia' is a particularly significant work.  It was her first ever commission. Numerous performances in Europe by Tessa Birnie � including a premiere broadcast on Radio Turkey! � led to subsequent performances by other pianists. Displaying a new technical confidence from her studies with Peter Maxwell Davies, the work�s single unified structure marks a turning point in Whitehead�s composing method. The title, refers not so much to free fantasy but to the imagination required to create music from minimal material; in this case - the opening three-note motive.  The work is in three sections, corresponding to these notes, and fabric of the entire piece is generated from them.  There are patterns that emerge within sections, as well as those spanning the entire piece, (trills and tempi changes included).  Because of the inherent symmetry of the generated material, with layers building up both forwards and backwards, Whitehead�s original intention was to make a palindromic structure, but it became instead a through-composed work with coda.  (Programme note by Emma Carle and Jack Body)."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The first movement opens quietly with a number of ideas in which the melodic interval of a fifth has some prominence. A faster section follows and the development of these ideas leads to climaxes with patterns of diverse rhythms superimposed.  After the final climax the movement subsides to a quiet ending. The second movement has the character of a Scherzo. Lively  rhythms alternating between 6/8 and 3/4 lead to a quieter sustained \"trio\" tune. The scherzo resumes and takes the music to a climax where these two ideas are presented together - the faster one (violins and trumpets) across the slower (horns and trombones). The music unwinds until we are left with a fragment of the slower theme, which becomes a link to the third movement. The finale has the form of a free passacaglia. It grows out of the opening trumpet tune and its accompaniment - the trumpet tune becomes the passacaglia bass, while the stepwise bass takes over as melody. At the end of the movement a reference back to the melodic falling fifths of the first movement leads to the final chord - fading from brass to wind, and in the end, to strings alone.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: (Letter to Tom Bayliss) This small orchestra version IS the original 1953 scoring that was recorded for the NZ Players to take on tour. In that recording we used a �harpsichordized� piano (sheets of newspaper over grand piano strings) to give an extra �edge� to the sound; you'll see the Waiteata score says �piano or harpsichord�, and it has been performed with harpsichord.  In writing the dances, I followed the play-script for the second act, keeping to regular 8-bar dance formulas and asking the director, Richard Campion, for approximate durations for each dance; (his original estimations usually turned out to be much too short!). Only one dance, the Tango, was danced on stage; here my wife-to-be, Raydia d'Elsa, helped me by going through the steps and fitting in the dialogue."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In New Zealand there has been a reluctance on the part of pakeha men to move to music.  Perhaps it is our Victorian background that makes us feel silly and self-conscious when dancing.  We pefer to sit back and be still, like the Tuatara.  In this piece, the old reptile (Tuatara) shakes off his passive past and moves to some more contemporary-sounding dance rhythms.   The work is in a continous movement, divided into several sections. It opens with an ironical glance at the atonal past before flicking it away, like a fly.  A jaunty 'Tuatara' theme is played on clarinet over bass ostinati, leading to a more vibrant and lively theme.   While the first section is earthy and physical in character, the second is a fantasy, full of ethereal images.  The initial delicate waltz theme develops and grows into a more menacing idea, before fading back into the 'Tuatara' theme.   The rest of the piece comprises various dances that adopt certain styles: jazz, folky, rock.  A gypsy-like theme combines with a version of 'God Defend NZ' in a section where pakeha men are on their feet! The finale uses log drum and Pacific Island rhythms to bring the piece to an exciting conclusion. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: These three vocalises, using Maori vowel sounds, were first recorded by the Wellington members of the National Youth Choir. They were composed for the opening section of �Wahine Toa�, a dance theatre celebration of Maori female ancestral figures. This work was performed at Taki Rua Theatre in Wellington in 1992 and in Christchurch in 1993. The three pieces are: 1.   �Te Po Nui, Te Po Roa�, where male voices hum a series of sustained chords. 2.   �The Earth Lay in the Womb of Darkness� - inspired by Robin Kahukiwa�s painting of the same title. This choral vocalise by full choir begins with alto melodic line, soon building to a widely spaced texture of superimposed fifth chords. 3.  �Papatuanuku - the Separation of Ranginui and Papatuanuku�.  The vocalise begins gently, becoming increasingly contrapuntal, building to five strong chords, and ending with a �sighing� texture of vocal glissandi. �Wahine Toa� was choreographed by Keri Kaa, Jan Bolwell and Sunny Amey, and was commissioned with assistance from the Queen Elizabeth 11 Arts Council of New Zealand."

This play was performed at the Depot Theatre, Wellington, during the International Festival of the Arts, March 1990. �Nga Puke� is a love story between a Maori soldier of the 28th Maori Battalion, Waru Thompson, and a Pakeha nurse, Angie. The setting is both the rural landscape of Porangahau, Hawkes Bay, and then a military hospital in Crete during World War 2. The first song, �Nga te Aroha� is about Waru and Angie�s exchange of gifts (greenstone and a painting of �Nga Puke�). The second song, �Taku Hoa Aroha�, is Angie�s love song for Waru, as he lies wounded in a Crete hospital."

The dance�s theme is the transferral of wisdom from the old to the young. In particular, the dance focuses on the Maori legend about the old woman, Muriranga-whenua, and the younger, sometimes mischevious Maui. �Wahine Toa� was choreographed by Keri Kaa, Jan Bolwell and Sunny Amey, commissioned with assistance from the Queen Elizabeth 11 Arts Council of New Zealand.  �Muriranga-whenua� played by Catherine Bowie was recorded for the CD �Matairangi - Helen Fisher Chamber Music� and is available at SOUNZ, the Centre for New Zealand Music.  The score is also included in �Little Dancings�, a selection of flute music published by the Centre for New Zealand Music."

Later performances in Bern (with a short lecture about it by me) and in Schaffhausen. Bruno Spoerri also played the tape abroad, in a demonstration of our work here. Preparation for the work involved analysis of several Chinese instruments; Ch'in (a zither), gong and wood block. The wave analysis was done'with a computer program and my imitations were realized on the Computer Music Center's DMX. There are two sets of texts: from the Tao Te Ching (Lao Tse) and from the I Ching. The Lao Tse texts were chosen by me and set with traditional notation. The I Ching texts were chosen by chance (with the computer) and set with a computer generated graphic notation. Proportions within the piece were also made with a computer program using chance and units of Golden Section. (More details in the introduction to the score)."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Hanging Bulb was commissioned by The Dunedin Sinfonia while the composer was Mozart Fellow at Otago University.   It consists of a continuous movement, divided into four sections: slow, fast, slow, fast.  Sections 1 and 2 are thematically related, as are sections 3 and 4, so the structure could be described as a double couplet.   The work expresses particular emotional and psychological states of mind, encapsulated in the title of the work which is an image of despair.  Hanging light bulbs have been associated with despair and obsession in the world of art and in the real world.  They became a significant image to the composer at the time of writing this piece, which was not born in happy circumstances. Tension in the music is created through extensive use of the octatonic scale, bi-modal effects and thickly layered chords (such as occur near the end).  The xylophone and bass drum are used as symbols of cruelty, while the piano has an important 'personal'statement in the first section.  The last section has an obsessional quality which is expressed through repeated rhythms and motifs.   A music resource for secondary schools is available for this work from SOUNZ. "

In that recording we used a �harpsichordized� piano (sheets of newspaper over grand piano strings) to give an extra �edge� to the sound; you'll see the Waiteata score says �piano or harpsichord�, and it has been performed with harpsichord.  In writing the dances, I followed the play-script for the second act, keeping to regular 8-bar dance formulas and asking the director, Richard Campion, for approximate durations for each dance; (his original estimations usually turned out to be much too short!). Only one dance, the Tango, was danced on stage; here my wife-to-be, Raydia d'Elsa, helped me by going through the steps and fitting in the dialogue."

  general_note: "Ritchie A.: Flute Concerto; cassette"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Flute Concerto was composed for flutist Alexa Still in 1993 while Ritchie was Composer - in - Residence with The Southern Sinfonia. Unlike the Symphony \"Boum\", written in the same year, this concerto is a generally happy and open-sounding work, and reflects aspects of Alexa Still's personality as well as her playing. She first performed the concerto on September 4th, 1993 in The Glenroy Auditorium, and subsequently recorded it with The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. The first movement is energetic in style, with a bubbling first theme. This is contrasted by a darker and slower second theme, exploring the lower register of the flute. The music accelerates back to the main theme before heading into a percussive middle section. The flute then presents a lyrical idea that is related to earlier themes, and this leads to a cadenza. A brief recapitulation drives the music to a forceful ending. The slow second movement is lyrical and improvisational in style, and begins with a solo for bass clarinet. A warm and gentle theme appears, followed by a short cadenza for flute. The orchestra returns with a fuller version of the theme, but it soon fades into anxious repeated chords on the oboes and bassoon while the flute plays nervous, flickering gestures. As the tension dissolves the clarinet introduces a laconic theme, interspersed with little cadenzas on the flute. The music builds to a climax where the main theme returns in a contrapuntal version, again fading into the anxious chords. A brief and mysterious coda contains references back to the opening cadenza, and the movement ends unresolved. The third movement is like a sequence of dances with different characters, bound together by a buffeting crotchet rhythm. After a flourish from the orchestra, the flute introduces a sprightly theme, followed by a quirky, subsidiary idea. The buffeting rhythm from the start is transformed into a pop-styled ostinato pattern, and the flute plays a lyrical melody above it. This theme was inspired by the composer attending a performance by The Muttonbirds, a well-known NZ rock group. The quirky theme returns in a more subdued setting, the music slows, and unexpectedly becomes a dreamy and child-like waltz. This distraction is swept away by a loud chord, and the main theme returns with renewed purpose, leading to an exciting conclusion in which all the elements of the movement are combined. The 'Flute Concerto' was recorded (in the orchestral version) by Alexa Still and the NZSO in 1996, on the Koch CD 3-7345-2-H1, entitled 'Kiwi Flute'. The second movement of the concerto was published in a special version for piano and flute by The Centre for NZ Music, in their 1998 publication 'Little Dancings: A Selection' of flute music by New Zealand Composers."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The starting point for this piece was a curiosity in the metal doors that covered the entrances to cells imbedded in the cliffs near Andersons Bay inlet, in Dunedin. A friend informed me that during the 19th century Maori prisoners were kept there at night, and worked on the Dunedin Harbour land reclamation during the day. Some of these prisoners were brought down to Dunedin from Taranaki in the North Island, as a result of the conflict in 1881 at Parihaka. Upon reading Dick Smith's book 'Ask that Mountain - The story of Parihaka' I learned of one of the most shocking incidents in our country's history. The land wars of the 1860s provoked a new approach from Maori to the protection of their lands. Te Whiti, Tohu and their followers at Parihaka combated the Pakeha land grab by organising passive resistance through a variety of means. In response to unauthorised land confiscation Te Whiti ordered the ploughing of fields, building of fences and planting, all of which impeded the surveyors who wished to carve up the land for settlers. Many were arrested, offering no struggle, and soon prisons around the country were full. Despite the many injustices Te Whiti maintained his policy of passive resistance to the end. In November 1881, government troops entered Parihaka with guns and artillery. They were greeted by Maori women and children chanting songs, but no armed struggle. Te Whiti and Tohu were taken away, the Pa was broken up, and hundreds sent away to prison. Despite a Press blackout, two reporters were smuggled into the Pa, one commenting that \"it was one of the saddest and most painful spectacles I have witnessed\". 'Remember Parihaka' attempts to sum up my thoughts and feelings about the events at Parihaka. The slow opening is peaceful, like a sun rise, with melodic fragments that slowly unfold into a fuller, more passionate statement. Flutes and oboes announce a chant-like theme, based on an actual song composed at the time of the incident. This 'Maori' theme alternates with a more European-sounding theme on solo violin, accompanied by an Irish drum, the bowron. At the heart of the piece the various melodic ideas come together over a grinding, relentless bass, building to a climax. In the short postlude, the peace of the opening is suggested, but now it is tinged with sadness, and a slightly uneasy feeling. This 9-minute piece was written while I was Composer-in-residence with the Southern Sinfonia, in 1994. It was first performed in that year, under the baton of John Hopkins."

  general_note: "Ritchie A.: Symphony \"Boum\"; cassette"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: The title of this symphony comes from the ominous tam tam stroke that opens the first movement, a mysterious sound heard by two of E M Forster's characters in 'A Passage to India' when they investigate the Marabar Caves. This is a sound which symbolises the mysteries of life and death, although Ritchie warns us not to take it all too literally. \"The echo is only a starting point to a general theme of human struggle. The listener can interpret the music in his or her own way.\" The first movement opens sonorously in the tonality of G, pulsating chords leading us inevitably to the first main theme, a theme that Ritchie himself characterises as a \"muscular, Bruknerian theme\", although the momentum that it engages owes more to Shostakovich. A sinuous saxophone theme is very significant in the central section, as is the lengthy oboe theme in the moderato section. The second movement opens with the sharp, bright sounds of oboes and clarinets accompanied by Cook Islands log drums. The log drum punctuates the movement's textures and creates a sense of propulsion. A light-hearted dance introduced by string quartet offers an opportunity for a change of mood. The third movement is a lament for the victims of the Bosnian wars. The highly evocative scoring of the opening pages was inpsired by the wailing of a Maori karanga, while tolling bells imbue this elegy with a special sense of tragedy. The symphony ends with a 'grand dance' which shows Ritchie has not been untouched by rock music. Several themes are brought together in an ecstatic coda, after which the music slowly unwinds over a reiterated pedal note. The opening of the first movement returns, and the final sound we hear is a single stroke on the tam tam. Symphony No.1 'Boum' was completed while Ritchie was Composer-in-residence with the Dunedin Sinfonia in 1993, and first performed the following year, under the baton of Sir William Southgate. It has recieved numerous performances, and was recorded for radio by the NZSO, in 1998, Auckland Philharmonia in 1996, Dunedin Sinfonia in 1994.  It is due for release on CD in 2007, with The Christchurch Symphony, and Kiwi Pacific Records. "

It was located at a spot which the old map-makers, peering at the tiny telescopic image of Mars, had noted as being of unusual brilliance, and had given the astonishingly prescient name �Nix Olympica�, the Snows of Olympus.�  (Arthur C. Clarke) While the title provided the impetus for this work, it is not intended to be strictly programmatic � rather, I have sought to establish a mood (or perhaps a �landscape�) which each title suggested to me. �Nix Olympica� was written at a time when I was becoming very interested in minimalism in musical composition, and much of the material reflects this. Minimalist works are usually built from a small amount of melodic or rhythmic material repeated many times, often with only slow subtle changes. Although the work is quite active rhythmically (especially the middle section) it is harmonically quite static. The first of the three sections (which follow each other without a break) establishes B flat as its tonal centre, and presents fragments of material which occur later in the work. The second section uses G as its rallying point with a secondary focus on B flat (a minor 3rd above G). The music consists of a series of ideas which gradually lengthen, framed by a structure of major subdivisions which come closer and closer together. The third section moves to an E minor tonality (a minor 3rd below G) and consists of a long languid melody played throughout by the clarinet. This music is derived from an independent work for flute, percussion and organ written at the 1985 Cambridge Music School. Throughout the work there is a preference for middle and upper-range timbres from all the instruments, but with few �extended playing techniques�. �Nix Olympica� was commissioned by the Music Federation of New Zealand (now Chamber Music New Zealand) for the Auckland Wind Quartet and pianist David Guerin. It was premiered by these performers in 1986."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Interlude for Piano' is written in a pointillistic melodic style first used in the previous work for piano, 'Diffractions for Piano & Chamber Orchestra'. 'Interludes' is a brief, freely evolving abstract piece with a somewhat improvisational feel to it, and is concerned with splashes of harmonic colour across the keyboard in the context of sinuous angular melodic fragments, hence the suggestion of the pointillistic aspect to the work. 'Interlude for Piano' was commissioned by Judith Clark on behalf of the Wellington Branch of the Institute of Registered Music Teachers. It was written for the IRMT conference in Nelson in January 1988 and the piece was given its first performance by Mark Secker at the Nelson School of Music. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This music was originally commissioned by Richard Campion for the New Zealand Players' production of �Ring Round the Moon� by Jean Ahhouil, translated by Christopher Fry. In the second act there is a ball taking place offstage and demanding a large number of dances which are specified in the text. The music was first recorded on acetate discs by a ad hoc orchestra led by Alex Lindsay; these small recordings were then played through speakers for the production, sounding very loud to the cast but filtering out more gently to the audience. At the end of the long national tour, the cast know the music very well and suggested to me that I should do something with it. The result, some years later, 1957, was a suite of nine dances first performed by the Alex Lindsay Orchestra.  This rapidly became my most performed piece and was commercially recorded by the Alex Lindsay Orchestra in the 1960s, a recording still available today from Kiwi Pacific Reords. Ashley Heenen, through the NZ APRA Committee, commissioned an arrangement for full orchestra for the NZ Youth Orchestra to take on a tour of Europe and China in 1975. This version was shortened to six dances by leaving out the first three numbers. The music has also been used for a ballet, The Wintergarden, choreographed by Arthur Turnbull for the Royal New Zealand Ballet Company - this version included a tenth dance not in the 1957 Suite. Since 1975 two further version have been commissioned: Waltz Suite (1989), for string orchestra (five dances) for the Nova Strings, and an arrangement of the original Dance Suite� (1992) for violin and piano (nine dances) for Isador Saslav.

It consists of a continuous movement, divided into four sections: slow, fast, slow, fast.  Sections 1 and 2 are thematically related, as are sections 3 and 4, so the structure could be described as a double couplet.   The work expresses particular emotional and psychological states of mind, encapsulated in the title of the work which is an image of despair.  Hanging light bulbs have been associated with despair and obsession in the world of art and in the real world.  They became a significant image to the composer at the time of writing this piece, which was not born in happy circumstances. Tension in the music is created through extensive use of the octatonic scale, bi-modal effects and thickly layered chords (such as occur near the end).  The xylophone and bass drum are used as symbols of cruelty, while the piano has an important 'personal'statement in the first section.  The last section has an obsessional quality which is expressed through repeated rhythms and motifs.   A music resource for secondary schools is available for this work from SOUNZ. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: \"Rakiura is the Maori name for Stewart Island - the Land of the Glowing Sky. The island lies to the far south of New Zealand. It is separated from the mainland of the South Island by Foveaux Strait. It is rugged, remote, bushclad, and very beautiful.\" (from the 'Author's note' by Eileen Philipp in the published play script \"Rakiura\"). \"Rakiura\" is the name of a play by Eileen Philipp. It retells, in the style of a Japanese Noh play, the true story of a Japanese woman found living in a cave on Stewart Island in the late 1970's. The woman had no coherent reason for being there, simply that she had had an obsessive need to travel far from Japan. Eventually convicted as an overstayer, she was escorted back to Japan by relatives. The play incorporates many of the stylized features of Noh drama including a chorus which comments on the action. My setting of parts of the text in no way tries to re-tell the narrative. Instead, I selected parts of the text which speak mainly of the landscape. In doing so, I have taken several liberties: the selected texts are presented here as though a single entity, whereas they come from various places in the play. Also, I have allocated the texts to choir or the alto solo according to structural or musical needs, rather than trying to retain the solo/chorus divisions of the original. The music oscillates between E minor and G minor harmonic centres. It is often quite static although there are two major climax points. Structurally the work is something of an arch, with the opening musical ideas returning at the end. \"Rakiura\" was commissioned by the Auckland Dorian Choir (conductor: Karen Grylls) with funding provided by the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council whose assistance is gratefully acknowledged."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In Procession I use several unorthodox playing techniques on the gamelan.  The tunings of pelog and slendro are combined freely throughout; the piano remains tuned as is usual (well-tempered chromatic).  The instruments are not dampened, but are left to ring on while subsequent notes are played, giving the effect of clouds of sound.  Compositionally as well the piece is not at all conventional, but explores the gamelan in different ways both harmonically and melodically.   In the first movement this is through combining the close intervals between the pelog and slendro modes; in �Quartet� through step-wise ascending movement; in the fifth movement, a transcription of a short Liszt Ave Maria, the gamelan approximates the triadic harmonies of the piano original.  The third movement, Melody in Pelog and Slendro, is closest to a traditional Javanese composition, although here the free intermingling of the two modes creates an unusual effect.  As well, various instruments are used in atypical ways- the Gong in the first movement struck with an open palm and functioning as a rhythmic marker, or the kempul in the third movement acting as an ostinato; over this rebab and gender elaborate melodic patterns combining the two tunings. The piano is sometimes used as a timbral device (as in the opening movement) and sometimes more in a melodic manner, as in the �Finale�.  Composed for pianist Dan Poynton and Gamelan Padhang Moncar of Victoria University of Wellington, who gave the first performance at the Composers� Association of New Zealand 20th Birthday celebrations in Wellington in November 1994.   Recorded by the same artists on Tabuh Pacific (Ode Record Company, CD Manu 1514).  Movement II, �Quartet� appears on the Centre for New Zealand Music (SOUNZ) Guide for Schools �SOUNZwrite Ears Wide Open Education Resource� CD, while Movement V Ave Maria is on the double CD issued by the New Zealand Geographic in their December 2006 issue featuring New Zealand composers."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: As conceived by Peter Schat, the Tone Clock is a formalization of the observation that, within the twelve-note chromatic system, there are twelve possible triads (i.e. groups of three notes, differentiated by the size of the intervals between them - the classical major and minor triads being two of the twelve), and that each of these triads may be transposed three times to give all twelve notes of the chromatic scale, without repetitions. Schat likened the twelve different triads, and their characteristic sonorities, to the twelve hours shown on a clock face, hence the name. McLeod saw in this an effective method for describing harmonic fields in any music using the chromatic system, and found that it helped explain choices she had made unconsciously in her own compositions. She expanded Schat�s system beyond the triads, to take into account every possible combination of intervals in all possible sizes of note groups. These piano pieces were the first works McLeod wrote after investigating the Tone Clock, and she achieved with them an unusually high level of personal expression. The first piece was written for David Farquhar�s sixtieth birthday, and the fifth for Olivier Messiaen�s eightieth birthday. Interestingly, the third piece is based entirely upon the harmonic movements in the first prelude in Bach�s Well-tempered Clavier, when applied to the extended harmonic world of the Tone Clock.  (Note: Mark Jones)."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Interlude for Piano' is written in a pointillistic melodic style first used in the previous work for piano, 'Diffractions for Piano & Chamber Orchestra'. 'Interludes' is a brief, freely evolving abstract piece with a somewhat improvisational feel to it, and is concerned with splashes of harmonic colour across the keyboard in the context of sinuous angular melodic fragments, hence the suggestion of the pointillistic aspect to the work. 'Interlude for Piano' was commissioned by Judith Clark on behalf of the Wellington Branch of the Institute of Registered Music Teachers. It was written for the IRMT conference in Nelson in January 1988 and the piece was given its first performance by Mark Secker at the Nelson School of Music. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Scored for flute, clarinet, vibraphone/marimba, piano, violin, viola and cello, this piece was written for performance by members of the Stockhausen�s ensemble, including parts designed specifically for Aloys Kontarsky, Siegfried Palm, and Cristoph Caskel, who, at the time, were the world�s leading performers of contemporary music. To the composer it seemed unlikely the work could ever be played in New Zealand, although it is noteworthy that Douglas Lilburn chose this as the first score to publish under his newly founded Waiteata editions imprint, such was his admiration for the composer�s achievement. However, with growing numbers of skilled and committed performers in New Zealand, �For Seven� eventually received its New Zealand premiere in 1992, by the new music ensemble CadeNZa.  Since then it has had several other fine performances here, and well as others in Europe. Recognition of the work�s status within our musical canon can be judged from the simultaneous CD publication of two different versions of the work, one by the UK-based ensemble Lontano conducted by Odaline de la Martinez, and this present recording by Stroma. 'For Seven' was one of the first pieces to combine elements from the two major European schools of the time - the Eastern European cluster music, and the serialism of Boulez and Stockhausen. The piece consists of various lines of composed accelerandi and ritardandi, determined by a network of simple numerical ratios. These ratios also govern other aspects of the piece, such as the lengths of sections and the pitch intervals used. Combined with the highly structured �foreground� material is more amorphous �background� material (including some improvisatory elements), with frequent interaction between the two. Though the construction of the piece is complex, the result had a natural musicality and flow. McLeod has said that, although she was not conscious of it at the time of composition, she now hears clearly the influence of the sounds of the New Zealand bush. (Programme note: Mark Jones)."

Kukutauaki stood in the middle of an area hostile to the Rangitane people.  On his way to the feast Mahuri was warned of the danger of entering territory controlled by the powerful and dangerous Te Rauparaha whereupon he replied: \"It is the boast of Te Puoho that he will not have his forehead smeared with blood.\" After the feast at which a new kind of food, the pumpkin, was introduced, the guests were invited back to Maimea, at the mouth of the Waikanae River, and massacred - most likely at the prompting of Te Rauparaha. This work was composed in 1987, commissioned and first performed by the New Zealand Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Anthony Jeenings.  It is scored for twelve solo strings: 4 violins I, 3 violins II, 2 violas, 2 cellos and double bass."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Hanging Bulb was commissioned by The Dunedin Sinfonia while the composer was Mozart Fellow at Otago University.   It consists of a continuous movement, divided into four sections: slow, fast, slow, fast.  Sections 1 and 2 are thematically related, as are sections 3 and 4, so the structure could be described as a double couplet.   The work expresses particular emotional and psychological states of mind, encapsulated in the title of the work which is an image of despair.  Hanging light bulbs have been associated with despair and obsession in the world of art and in the real world.  They became a significant image to the composer at the time of writing this piece, which was not born in happy circumstances. Tension in the music is created through extensive use of the octatonic scale, bi-modal effects and thickly layered chords (such as occur near the end).  The xylophone and bass drum are used as symbols of cruelty, while the piano has an important 'personal'statement in the first section.  The last section has an obsessional quality which is expressed through repeated rhythms and motifs.   A music resource for secondary schools is available for this work from SOUNZ. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Text: anonymous, translated by Lady Gregory. The music of �A West Irish Ballad� follows the course of an anonymous Irish poem, and is influenced by Irish traditional music.  Much of the musical imagery comes from the poetry, from the snipe and the �lonely bird in the woods�, to the developing ostinato reminiscent of church bells, and to the broader feeling of the landscape as I imagine it, and the deep emotion of Irish laments and love songs. �A West Irish Ballad� was written for the Sydney Chamber Choir."

The song merges in and out of a tapestry consisting of fragments of Bach, Beethoven, Maori waiata and others (Keith Jarrett and Jonathan Crayford can both be felt in there too), all structured in a style inspired by Bach's choral preludes.  The underlying melody is a famous song written at the turn of the century by the Maori Princess, Te Rangi Pai. Dedicated to Hirini Melbourne."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'String Quartet No.2' was composed in Devonport, Auckland, between November 1994 and February 1995 with financial assistance provided by the New Zealand Composers� Foundation and the Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa. The first performance was given at the Watershed Theatre, Auckland on the 10th March 1995 by Simon McLellan & Sarah Hart (violins), Judith Williams (cello) and with the composer as violist. Denys Trussell wrote in a subsequent review (Quote Unquote, April 1995): \"Nigel Keay...had his substantial and dramatic Second Quartet given its first performances at these concerts. It is in part a synthesis of the strictly modernist and the freer post-modernist harmonic constructions: Keay is moving away from a music of sustained dissonance in this work towards a music where consonance and dissonance interact. The middle movement, slow and introspective, is a striking instance of this.\" Since then 'String Quartet No.2' has established itself as one of the composer�s most-performed, and most widely-performed works having been played in New Zealand, Thailand, Japan, France and Germany by several different formations. Nigel Keay's 'Second String Quartet' was performed at the 17th Conference and Festival of the Asian Composers League in Bangkok by the Ensemble Contemporary Alpha (Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music), and at the �Stella Nova� Concerts in Tokyo. It has been performed also in NZ by Ensemble Philharmonia (members of the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra), and the Nevine String Quartet (Elizabeth Patchett & Janet Armstrong - violins, Peter Barber - Viola, & Robert Ibell - Cello (members of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra)) (recording and broadcast by Radio NZ's Concert FM). It received performances in 2004 & 2005 by the Quatuor Aphan�s in Paris and Germany. The writing of the quartet was inspired by a love of the medium, particularly as a player having experienced the late quartets of Beethoven and other repertoire."

  general_note: "Orchestra Reading Panel 1; cassette"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Flute Concerto was composed for flutist Alexa Still in 1993 while Ritchie was Composer - in - Residence with The Southern Sinfonia. Unlike the Symphony \"Boum\", written in the same year, this concerto is a generally happy and open-sounding work, and reflects aspects of Alexa Still's personality as well as her playing. She first performed the concerto on September 4th, 1993 in The Glenroy Auditorium, and subsequently recorded it with The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. The first movement is energetic in style, with a bubbling first theme. This is contrasted by a darker and slower second theme, exploring the lower register of the flute. The music accelerates back to the main theme before heading into a percussive middle section. The flute then presents a lyrical idea that is related to earlier themes, and this leads to a cadenza. A brief recapitulation drives the music to a forceful ending. The slow second movement is lyrical and improvisational in style, and begins with a solo for bass clarinet. A warm and gentle theme appears, followed by a short cadenza for flute. The orchestra returns with a fuller version of the theme, but it soon fades into anxious repeated chords on the oboes and bassoon while the flute plays nervous, flickering gestures. As the tension dissolves the clarinet introduces a laconic theme, interspersed with little cadenzas on the flute. The music builds to a climax where the main theme returns in a contrapuntal version, again fading into the anxious chords. A brief and mysterious coda contains references back to the opening cadenza, and the movement ends unresolved. The third movement is like a sequence of dances with different characters, bound together by a buffeting crotchet rhythm. After a flourish from the orchestra, the flute introduces a sprightly theme, followed by a quirky, subsidiary idea. The buffeting rhythm from the start is transformed into a pop-styled ostinato pattern, and the flute plays a lyrical melody above it. This theme was inspired by the composer attending a performance by The Muttonbirds, a well-known NZ rock group. The quirky theme returns in a more subdued setting, the music slows, and unexpectedly becomes a dreamy and child-like waltz. This distraction is swept away by a loud chord, and the main theme returns with renewed purpose, leading to an exciting conclusion in which all the elements of the movement are combined. The 'Flute Concerto' was recorded (in the orchestral version) by Alexa Still and the NZSO in 1996, on the Koch CD 3-7345-2-H1, entitled 'Kiwi Flute'. The second movement of the concerto was published in a special version for piano and flute by The Centre for NZ Music, in their 1998 publication 'Little Dancings: A Selection' of flute music by New Zealand Composers."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: �The three poems here set have always seemed to me to share some ambient and most poignant awareness of our experience on these islands, whether of small remote sounds in summer, the desolation of a crippled gull, or the brilliance of summer harvesting, or whatever might make us feel at home�  �Douglas Lilburn  Lilburn found an underlying experiential similarity in these poems by Ruth Dallas (Nos. 1 and 2) and Basil Dowling (No. 3), which he drew the fore in his settings.  The keyboard introduction of �Clear Sky� captures the play of expansiveness (in the broad registral reach) and homeliness (the repeated motifs) that characterises the set as a whole.  In �The Picnic� the spacious quality of the keyboard, evoking the circling swallows in their easy flight, is tinged by a haunting iambic limp.  Lilburn�s word painting here is poignant and ironic:  vocal melismas depict the crumpled, curled foot of the one-footed gull, and our (short?) memories of his sorry sight.  �Summer Afternoon� sums up the ambivalent mood of the set.  The declamatory voice (also found in �The Picnic�) gradually becomes more lyrical, and a sense of progress is conveyed through the rising vocal line (as in �Clear Sky�).  Yet there is a lingering sadness.  The keyboard�s recurrent fluttering seventh and off-beat falling fourth recalls the desolation and troubling limp of �The Picnic�.  (Note by Nancy November)."

These auras permeate the work.  The piece is in a single movement - its various sections related rhythmically.  It was first performed by Barbara King and the Victoria University Orchestra under Peter Walls in August 1995. "

I am grateful to Robert Craft and the Stravinsky Estate for permission to use it here. Stravinsky's melody is played by the first trumpet in each of the three chorale settings. All three are canonic in treatment, with the texture increasing from two parts in Chorale 1 to four parts (plus a tuba bass-line) in Chorale 3.  The two Interludes take off from the finale notes of the chorale. In contrast both are quick, with a somewhat Stravinskian rhythmic exhuberance; Interlude 1 is scored for a trio (excluding the two trumpets), Interlude 2 for the full quintet. "

The Flourish aims to capture the lady's attention; through the Romance, Dance, and Aria the suitor presses his cause, and in the Finale the couple celebrate a successful outcome.  I wouldn't, however, suggest that this story line be taken too literally! The music, I hope, speaks for itself. The Aria gives the double-bass a chance to shine as a soloist, and the Finale refers back to earlier material, then skips for joy, and finally relaxes into a tranquil �apotheosis�.  This Serenade was commissioned by Denis and Verna Adam to celebrate their fortieth wedding anniversary. The first performance was given by the NZ Chamber Orchestra in September 1993. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: These pieces were originally piano duets, written with one easy part for my wife  to play, and presented to her on various anniversary occasions in the 1960�s.  This orchestral suite was arranged for the 1965 Cambridge Summer Music  School, and first performed there by the school�s orchestra.  The translation from piano to orchestral sounds makes many opportunities for  variety of colours and for real sostenuto. But while orchestral sound is bound to  be very different, I have attempted in the Trio of the Mexicana to capture  something of the effect of the piano�s harmonic resonoctet to provide sustaining echoes of the oboe�s tune.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Flute Concerto was composed for flutist Alexa Still in 1993 while Ritchie was Composer - in - Residence with The Southern Sinfonia. Unlike the Symphony \"Boum\", written in the same year, this concerto is a generally happy and open-sounding work, and reflects aspects of Alexa Still's personality as well as her playing. She first performed the concerto on September 4th, 1993 in The Glenroy Auditorium, and subsequently recorded it with The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. The first movement is energetic in style, with a bubbling first theme. This is contrasted by a darker and slower second theme, exploring the lower register of the flute. The music accelerates back to the main theme before heading into a percussive middle section. The flute then presents a lyrical idea that is related to earlier themes, and this leads to a cadenza. A brief recapitulation drives the music to a forceful ending. The slow second movement is lyrical and improvisational in style, and begins with a solo for bass clarinet. A warm and gentle theme appears, followed by a short cadenza for flute. The orchestra returns with a fuller version of the theme, but it soon fades into anxious repeated chords on the oboes and bassoon while the flute plays nervous, flickering gestures. As the tension dissolves the clarinet introduces a laconic theme, interspersed with little cadenzas on the flute. The music builds to a climax where the main theme returns in a contrapuntal version, again fading into the anxious chords. A brief and mysterious coda contains references back to the opening cadenza, and the movement ends unresolved. The third movement is like a sequence of dances with different characters, bound together by a buffeting crotchet rhythm. After a flourish from the orchestra, the flute introduces a sprightly theme, followed by a quirky, subsidiary idea. The buffeting rhythm from the start is transformed into a pop-styled ostinato pattern, and the flute plays a lyrical melody above it. This theme was inspired by the composer attending a performance by The Muttonbirds, a well-known NZ rock group. The quirky theme returns in a more subdued setting, the music slows, and unexpectedly becomes a dreamy and child-like waltz. This distraction is swept away by a loud chord, and the main theme returns with renewed purpose, leading to an exciting conclusion in which all the elements of the movement are combined. The 'Flute Concerto' was recorded (in the orchestral version) by Alexa Still and the NZSO in 1996, on the Koch CD 3-7345-2-H1, entitled 'Kiwi Flute'. The second movement of the concerto was published in a special version for piano and flute by The Centre for NZ Music, in their 1998 publication 'Little Dancings: A Selection' of flute music by New Zealand Composers."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This string quartet is performed as one movement. The first section is predominantly contrapuntal, including the opening bars where each performer sings �Aue� (meaning �Alas!�, a Maori acclamation in some waiata tangi). The work continues with a section which features solo cello, followed by dance and song-like sections. Much of the work is based on the intervals of a minor third, semitone and tone. Karanga, Maori song-calls performed by women on the marae to welcome or farewell people, are one source of inspiration for this piece. A characteristic musical feature of karanga is a long drawn out cry (glissando). Since there is often more than one caller on the marae, it is not uncommon for the calls to overlap. This work was commissioned by the Hutt Valley Chamber Music Society, with fundng provided by the Queen Elizabeth 11 Arts Council. In October 1994 the New Zealand String Quartet gave its premiere performance at Lower Hutt. �String Quartet� (1994) is dedicated to the memory of May Manoy (1913-1993), a lifelong friend who was also an enthusiastic supporter of chamber music in Wellington since the late 1940s."

The dance�s theme is the transferral of wisdom from the old to the young. In particular, the dance focuses on the Maori legend about the old woman, Muriranga-whenua, and the younger, sometimes mischevious Maui. �Wahine Toa� was choreographed by Keri Kaa, Jan Bolwell and Sunny Amey, commissioned with assistance from the Queen Elizabeth 11 Arts Council of New Zealand.  �Muriranga-whenua� played by Catherine Bowie was recorded for the CD �Matairangi - Helen Fisher Chamber Music� and is available at SOUNZ, the Centre for New Zealand Music.  The score is also included in �Little Dancings�, a selection of flute music published by the Centre for New Zealand Music."

It was partly inspired by the changing and contrasting moods of sea, wind and sky that shape Wellington�s hilly and exposed environment.  The title, combining two Maori words, �Matai� meaning �sea� and �Rangi� meaning �sky�, is an original name for one of Wellington�s more prominent hills, Mount Victoria. �Matairangi - 1� was commissioned by Chamber Music New Zealand for James Bush and Sarah Watkins to premiere in 1996, and the funds for the commission were provided by Creative New Zealand Toi Aotearoa.  ��Matairangi - 1�was recorded for the CD �Matairangi - Helen Fisher Chamber Music� which is available at SOUNZ, the Centre for New Zealand Music. The work is dedicated to Joan Henderson, Helen Fisher�s cousin."

The work is inspired by the Wellington environment,  particularly tui birdsong and also both reflective and sparkling waters. It is perhaps best summed up by a New Zealand adaptation of some lines in T.S. Eliot�s �Four Quartets�: �After the [tui�s] wing Has answered light to light, and is silent, the light is still At the still point of the turning world� �Matairangi - 2� for flutes (C-flute, alto flute and piccolo),viola and harp, was commisssioned by Catherine and Christine Bowie with funding provided by Creative New Zealand Toi Aotearoa, and it was premiered by Trio Bilitis on 13 July 1997 for the Wellington Chamber Music Society. �Matairangi - 2� was recorded by Trio Bilitis for the CD �Matairangi - Helen Fisher Chamber Music� which is available at SOUNZ, the Centre for New Zealand Music."

The water is also used in traditional and contemporary forms of blessing our young. The line waiora waimarama wairua refers to the life-giving force of the water, its clarity and purity, and the spiritual essence which pervades it and every life force. The second verse  focuses on the importance of generation after generation preserving all that is important: Te puna o te tangata refers to the fountain of humankind, that is, the womb which produces the future progeny of our people. From woman is born humankind � generations of people who continue to nurture and maintain those treasures passed down through eons of time: knowledge and wisdom, the importance of caring for others and looking after the environment. The final line, tamaiti taiohi taiao creates a link between the (tiny) infant, youth and the wider environment, and ultimately the Universe. The piece is devised so that it can be performed with or without the taonga puoro (koauau ponga ihu and koauau koiwi kuri). In the event that it is sung with the taonga, there can be considerable flexibility to allow the weaving of soloist and koauau. The koauau ponga ihu, used in the first verse, is a very quiet instrument, while the koauau koiwi kuri. Accidentals refer throughout the bar. Sometimes cautionary accidentals are used. In the sustained pedal sections, staggered breathing should be used to ensure continuity of sound."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This bicultural music drama for choir, kapa haka, orchestra, soloists, narrator, also Maori and Irish traditional instruments was a collaboration among Helen Fisher (music), Wi Kuki Kaa (Maori composition) and Lauris Edmond (lyrics). The production that took place at the Nelson School of Music in May 1998, involving one hundred performers, drew on John and Hilary Mitchell�s extensive manuscript �Te Tau Ihu o Te Waka - A History of Maori of Nelson and Marlborough�. �Taku Wana� focuses on stories, both positive and painful, of our joint Maori- Pakeha history in Nelson since 1841 particularly the events surrounding the Wairau tragedy in 1843.  Rangimoana Taylor was the artistic director and Rita Paczian was the conductor.Creative New Zealand Toi Aotearoa, as well as local sponsors and producers, gave significant support. In the title, the Maori word �wana� has several shades of meaning, including �dignity�, ray of sunlight� and �new bud�. �Taku Wana - the Enduring Spirit� holds onto the ideal of the inner dignity of each person living in Aotearoa New Zealand, where Maori are fully acknowledged as Tangata Whenua and where Tangata Tiriti, that is, all other cultures stand tall as well.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The tape part in 'Sound Cylinders' consists mainly of flute sounds that have been altered or modified with the help of a computer.  This not only provides a way for the spectral qualities of the flute to be extended in the tape part, but also allows for a singularity in the overall timbral character of the work. The flute part utilises several extended techniques (such as tongue rams). The work attempts to incorporate each of these extended techniques as an integral and integrated part of the overall sound world of the piece. The opening inhale/exhale breathing sounds establishes the nature of the dialogue between the flute and tape parts in the work.  'Sound Cylinders' was written for Tony Ferner over the summer of 1996 and 1997. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work contains a wide mix of styles ranging from the baroque keyboard music of JS Bach and romantic piano texture of Chopin to the sparser rhythmic devices of minimalism.   The opening Prelude is a through-composed fragmentation of a simple lyrical line, leading to the exciting Toccata. The second and fourth movements strongly reflect both the neoclassical and minimalist trends and the third movement harks back to the opening prelude but more in the style of a Chopin nocturne. This piece is dedicated to my Mother and Father, without whom my musical development would not have been possible.  I hope that in my work I show them just how proud I am of them. This edition was produced for the 1997 release of a CD of new music written by composers resident in the Canterbury region of New Zealand."

The piece was written during the summer of 1997/98 when El Nino battered Canterbury with fierce Nor'west winds. While the main impetus of the work centres around a musical argument, there is also a loose correlation between the variety  and culmination of musical activity, and the variety and culmination of wind intensities in the El Nino weather patterns."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Doldrums  (for amplified cello) was written for Dr Alexander Ivashkin in early 1995. By amplifying the cello, many of the smaller nuances in the sounds can be heard, allowing the piece to be more intimate in nature. The work brings together two disparate sound worlds: a series of melodic lines and a set of noise-oriented glissandos.   It is the balance and juxtaposition of these two sonic elements which gives the piece its expressive meaning,  producing a sense of movement and progression while simultaneously seeming to remain stationary.  (Hence the title)."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: (Letter to Tom Bayliss) This small orchestra version IS the original 1953 scoring that was recorded for the NZ Players to take on tour. In that recording we used a �harpsichordized� piano (sheets of newspaper over grand piano strings) to give an extra �edge� to the sound; you'll see the Waiteata score says �piano or harpsichord�, and it has been performed with harpsichord.  In writing the dances, I followed the play-script for the second act, keeping to regular 8-bar dance formulas and asking the director, Richard Campion, for approximate durations for each dance; (his original estimations usually turned out to be much too short!). Only one dance, the Tango, was danced on stage; here my wife-to-be, Raydia d'Elsa, helped me by going through the steps and fitting in the dialogue."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Symphony in Five Movements' was composed in Auckland in 1995/96 for the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra as part of its Composer-in-Residence programme. It was first performed on the 1st August 1996 in a concert at the Aotea Centre, Auckland as part of a Main Series programme. A central idea to the 'Symphony' concerns aspects of timing. Its form was partially inspired by the martial arts treatise 'Go Rin No Sho' (A Book of Five Rings), which considers timing and its relationship to strategy.  The five books are: Ground, Water, Fire, Wind & Void. There is a loose correspondence between the inspiration behind some of the movements and each of the �books.� Thus, the third movement refers to the book of tradition �wind,�and consequently, is modelled on a scherzo, not only paying tribute to Beethoven, but in a broader sense indicating the desire to give the entire work a historical reference.  The Introduction or first movement is analogous to the �ground� book (the path), outlining the Symphony�s musical ideas. The fifth movement (�void�) has a strongly rhythmic structure with contemporary influence throughout, reflected in, and overlayed with its violin-based lyrical stream. This strongly linear work was described by Denys Trussell in a subsequent review for 'Quote Unquote' after its Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra performance in 1996 (conducted by Enrique Diemecke) as being \"rich with feeling and atmosphere.\" The fourth and fifith movements were given a reading by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra conducted by Hamish McKeich at the NZSO - SOUNZ Readings in October 2001 in Wellington.

  general_note: "Body: Three transcriptions, Four stabiles; cassette"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Four Stabiles' was composed when I was newly graduated from university, after I had decided that I liked the idea of becoming a composer. Margaret Nielsen graciously gave it an early airing and the score was promptly published by Waiteata Press Music, giving me a tremendous boost of self-confidence. The �60s were a time when musical abstraction was the vogue, when a mathematical structure justified the music. Thus the inverted palindromic form of Stabile I based on its two versions of the all-interval symmetrically invertible 12-tone chord was a source of considerable composerly satisfaction!  All but one of the dedicatees, personal friends, have long since either drifted or passed away. The one remaining contact, William Dart, is characterised in Stabile III, a tender portrait of someone who was then living a curiously isolated existence. Tony (Stabile 1) I admired for his good looks and spiritual curiosity, while winsome Robert (Stabile 2) was the object of one of my compulsive crushes. Gaye (Stabile 4) was a passionately energetic fellow student at Teacher�s College, who, sadly, took her own life a few years later. These pieces use fixed register, that is, each note (C, C#, etc) is heard at only one register, creating a static vertical relationship between the pitches. Variety is achieved by viewing the �sound object� from different perspectives, just as a viewer explores a static sculptural structure (a stabile) by walking around it. Movements one and three permit two possible registers for each note by using two chords, one the inversion of the other. Another feature of the first movement is that it is palindromic. The gentle sounds of the Stabile 2 suggest a star-lit night, Stabile 4 strives for rhythmic momentum to counter the essentially static compositional technique, while an informed listener will easily recognise the debt that Stabile 3 owes to the first of Douglas Lilburn�s �Nine Short Pieces�.

Encountering these sculptures in the British Museum for the first time, I was intrigued to learn that one of the decorative motifs adorning its carved stone form was known as �egg and tongue�. The sensuously rounded forms of eggs and tongues alternate and repeat along the borders of the monumental sculptures, an ancient pattern combining symbols of virility and fertility. The motif is widespread: several years later, walking through the ruined architecture of the Syrian city of Apamea, I found tumbled-down stones of Roman structures bearing this same pattern, rain-washed stones in a field of crocuses.  In the music of �Egg and Tongue�, I play with ideas of patterning and fragmentation, cultural property and style. Familiar motifs repeat, adorn, are lost and take new shapes."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Whitehead has always had an affinity with the music of the sixteenth century � for three years she sang in Peter Godfrey�s choir at St. Mary�s Cathedral in Auckland, where the repertoire included Byrd�s four part mass. This experience meant that the writing of this work came naturally. Written while studying in Wellington, the Mass is one of the first of her works that Gillian heard performed; the Victoria University choir conducted by Robert Oliver sang selected movements, while its first complete performance, in an otherwise �all Bach� concert by the Leonine Consort in Sydney, was broadcast on television.  The reviewer of this concert, Roger Covell, wrote �Gillian Whitehead�s Missa Brevis easily rose to the challenge of justifying its presence� (showing) rare understanding of how to write for concerted voices; everything she calculated on paper worked in practice in this tenderly beautiful performance�.  (Programme note by Emma Carle and Jack Body)."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work is a setting of a short poem by the Spanish poet Miguel de Unamuno (1864-1936). It begins by setting the text in a fragmentary manner, choosing single key words from the poem: canta (singing), luna (moon), sosegada (lulling), blanca (white), and sola (alone). Throughout, I have sought to evoke a mood of stillness and calm (except at the two main climaxes), and much of the writing consists of simple diatonic chords alternating between the two choirs. The work ends, as it began, alternating the words 'canta' and 'luna'. The unusual scoring came about through my friendship with a fine horn player and singer - a flippant comment about unorthodox combinations of forces (although I have heard one other work for horn and choir) providing the germ of idea which eventually did bear fruit. �The Moon is Silently Singing� is one of my most widely preformed works internationally, having been heard in Australia, Canada, Germany, England and the USA. It is scheduled for publication by Walton Music in 2004."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Down in the Brunner Mine was commissioned by The Onslow Brass Band in Wellington and first performed and broadcast in 1996.  It is a short set of variations based on a New Zealand folk song called 'Down in the Brunner Mine'.  The folk song describes the coal mine on the West Coast, near Greymouth, and tells of the disaster that occured there in the 1890s when about 60 men were killed in a mine collapse.  Here is the first stanza:   We worked in the heat and the thick black dust,  Sticks to your skin like a burnt pie crust,  We rue each day the miner must  Go down in the Brunner Mine.   The folksong tune is announced by the cornets at the beginning, playing in their low register, accompanied by heavy chords in the low brass.  Variation 1 features a horn solo, and the cornets return for Variation 2, playing in fourths.  Variations 3 and 4 are strident in character and feature short flourishes.  The snare drum enters at the start of Variation 5 and the cornets play a punchy idea using repeated notes.   This idea returns in contrapuntal form in Variation 7, while the 6th variation inbetween features little fragments of the theme on various instruments.  Variation 8 is powerful and buffeting, and uses the theme in canon.  Variations 9-11 make use of the theme's arpeggio outline and the music builds to a climax.   Following this, the music gradually winds down in Variation 12, with the theme appearing in inversion against a repeated bass pattern. After a reflective silence, the short chorale-like coda rounds off the work, and is marked \"in memoriam\". "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This bicultural music drama for choir, kapa haka, orchestra, soloists, narrator, also Maori and Irish traditional instruments was a collaboration among Helen Fisher (music), Wi Kuki Kaa (Maori composition) and Lauris Edmond (lyrics). The production that took place at the Nelson School of Music in May 1998, involving one hundred performers, drew on John and Hilary Mitchell�s extensive manuscript �Te Tau Ihu o Te Waka - A History of Maori of Nelson and Marlborough�. �Taku Wana� focuses on stories, both positive and painful, of our joint Maori- Pakeha history in Nelson since 1841 particularly the events surrounding the Wairau tragedy in 1843.  Rangimoana Taylor was the artistic director and Rita Paczian was the conductor.Creative New Zealand Toi Aotearoa, as well as local sponsors and producers, gave significant support. In the title, the Maori word �wana� has several shades of meaning, including �dignity�, ray of sunlight� and �new bud�. �Taku Wana - the Enduring Spirit� holds onto the ideal of the inner dignity of each person living in Aotearoa New Zealand, where Maori are fully acknowledged as Tangata Whenua and where Tangata Tiriti, that is, all other cultures stand tall as well.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The title suggests a mixed metaphor, the organic alongside the astronomical. Although the words arrived late in the process, they go some way towards describing the forces at work. Propelled by small-scale rhythmic articulation, strands reach out towards points, tracing delicate spirals through space. Alongside these sit diffuse clouds of material, out of which new constellations take shape. There is above all a concern with the intimate connection between the gestures of performance and their sonic result. The instruments act as filters which shape raw sound in a manner reminiscent of the procedures of the electroacoustic studio. There is a constant tension between organic direction and quite arbitrary frameworks, a mesh of non-congruent processes operating on different structural levels. In front of this, the intricate detail of the audible surface attempts to impose perceptual order on the precariously balanced network of forces."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This piece is dedicated to my grandmother, Phyllis Collier, whose voice and stories form its core. She talks about her experience of the Second World War from the distance of New Zealand, and her relationship to her older brother, David. We become aware that this is a retelling, a memory, which has been reconstructed many times (and once more by the composer in the studio). It has the obliqueness, the fragmentary quality of distant remembering; the meaning is carried as much by what is not said as by what is. The ambiguous relationship between the sonic and the semantic strata underlines this, as do the shifts between real and imaginary environments. The self conscious artifacts of the recording and editing process - background noise and tape hiss - remind us that this is a construct. Still it is one that touches on one person�s particular experience, and ultimately it is the person, more than the story, that is brought into focus."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: New Zealand's landscape has long been a source of inspiration for artists and composers.  I was fortunate enough to have enjoyed frequent trips to the mountains when young, and I still remember them fondly to this day.  I have written quite a number of works on the theme of New Zealand's natural environment. So I was very pleased to be asked by The Dunedin Sinfonia and Natural History New Zealand to compose 'Southern Journeys'.   After initial discussions in 1999, I was given freedom to come up with my own 'synopsis' for the piece.  The music was to be written first, and then recorded by the Dunedin Sinfonia so that images could be put to the music.  This was a considerable luxury for the composer, as normally the film is made first and later the music is written to fit the images. Natural History was insistent that I should compose my music without the restriction of specific images, and for that I am very grateful.   Although 'Southern Journeys' is programmatic, I have attempted to incorporate a symphonic logic into the music.  Themes are developed and transformed, and there is an element of cyclic form with the return of the opening theme at the very end of the work.  Ideally, the music should be able to stand alone without film, and still make sense.   The first movement is subtitled 'Ancient South' and portrays southern landscape, particularly remote areas such as mountains and sounds.  The land is constantly being changed by water, snow and wind, the most dramatic example being the effects of avalanches.  In the second movement, 'Southern Adventures', humans interact with Nature, at sea, in caves, on rock faces, in the air.  Although these adventures are often difficult and treacherous, we feel exhilerated by this risky communion with Nature.  The third movement, 'Seasons in the South', begins with the stillness of lakes and forests in Autumn, and moves on to explore southern bird and sea life.  Winter announces its arrival with a storm, followed by the thawing of snow and ice and the first signs of Spring.   The last movement, 'Our Place', explores our own environment and contrasts it with the natural enviroment we have witnessed in the previous movements.  A note of caution is sounded: we cannot take the natural beauty of the South for granted.  We have to respect and care for it, so as to maintain the balance between our needs and the needs of Nature.  At the end of the movement a harmony exists between the beautiful aspects of a city like Dunedin and the natural enviroment.   'Southern Journeys' received financial assistance from the Millennium Fund and Natural History New Zealand "

  general_note: "Ritchie, A: From the southern marches; CD"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: From the Southern Marches was the brain-child of George Griffiths, historian and owner of Otago Heritage Books in Dunedin.  He writes:  'For many years I'd pondered the nature of the southern region and the people who live in it - particularly the contraditcory characteristics passed on from our Scots forebears, with their unrelenting capacity for hard work and their uncertain trust in the rewards to be gained from it.  in a broader view, it seemed the development of a southern character was  story so rich in human spirit and diversity that it demanded some kind of expression.'   The 'kind of expression' depended very much on George's choice of texts which come from a wide variety of sources, ranging from old Maori chants to more recent poetry.  The work progresses more or less in a chronological manner, but avoids becoming a potted history of the south.  Each text from each particular era focusses on a special characteristic of the time - whether it is the reckless optimism of the gold miners in the 1860s, or the grim reality of the needle-workers in the 1880s who were virtual slaves.  George has drawn on a rich variety of ideas and texts, so that more serious items are contrasted with humour, as in Thatcher's 'The Old Identity' or 'King' Dick Seddon's political speech.  Some items involve text with existent tunes, and the music becomes an arrangement (as is the case with 'The Old Identity').  Sometimes these tunes are just a starting point for lengthy elaboration, as in 'Bright Fine Gold', based on the tune for 'Hot Cross Buns'.   'From the Southern Marches' has a format that is similar to oratorio, with alternations between solo vocal items and choruses, with the addition of two purely orchestral sections.  There is even references to the 'recitative' style in 'The Jubilee', 'Southern Education' and elsewhere. It runs to almost two hours in length, and is divided into two halves. Here are the individual sections:   PART ONE  Orchestral Prelude  The Southerners are not unwary pigeons (texts by Boultbee, Te Rauparaha/Potiki, Kaukoe) - choir, bass, soprano  A Meeting of Peoples (Boultbee/Kennard) - choir  There's Nae Place like Otago Yet (texts by Barr, Blair)- orchestral prelude, soprano solo, choir  The Stars of Orion (text by Read; nursery rhme) - tenor, sopranos, choir  The Old Identity (text by Thatcher) - bass, tenor, choir   PART TWO  Unlock the Land (texts by Wood, Braken, McLauchlan, Dallas) - choir, with tenor, bass, sopranos  Southern Education (texts by Stafford; Griffiths, trad.) - bass, choir  The Jubilee (texts by Seddon/Griffiths, various) - bass, sopranos  Southerns, Come Follow me Out of your Hills (texts by August, music by Lithgow) - choir  People at an Exhibition - orchestra  These are Our Lands (text by Glover) - tenor, all soloists, choir  That Old Identity (Thatcher's ghost) - soloists and choir   This work was composed in 1997, and first performed in March, 1998, to coincide with the 150th anniversary of settlement in Otago and Southland.  The performers on this occasion were The Dunedin Sinfonia under Nicholas Braithwaite, with the City of Dunedin Choir, Southern Consort of Voices, Southern Youth Choir, plus four soloists: Ana James(soprano), Deborah Wai Kapohe(soprano), Iain Fraser(tenor), and Jonathan Lemalu(bass).  Such was the success of this premiere, From the Southern Marches was repeated in December of the same year, this time with Dobbs Franks conducting.   A commercial CD was released in 1998 using the live recording of the premiere.  Copies of this are still available from the composer, or from Otago Heritage Books (500 Great King Street, Dunedin).   In 1998, Otago Heritage Books won a Special Merit Award in the National Business Review's Business Sponsorship of the Arts Awards ."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: These pieces utilise Abelian form, a concept I developed whereby the proportions of a large form were reflected in its constituent parts.  A large form, for instance, has sections A, B, C, D, and E, with respective durations t1, t2, t3, t4, t5.  A, B, C, D, E also have subsections whose proportions are also t1, t2, t3, t4, t5.  We can designate the subsections of A as Aa, Ab, Ac, Ad and Ae, and similarly for the others.  The whole process can be shown in the following table: Aa    Ab    Ac    Ad    Ae Ba    Bb    Bc    Bd    Be Ca    Cb    Cc    Cd    Ce Da   Db    Dc    Dd    De      Ea    Eb    Ec    Ed    Ee This looks like a mathematical Abelian Group - hence the name.  The durations of subsections symmetrically placed about the leading diagonal (Aa, Bb, Cc, Dd and Ee) are also equal because duration of Ab = duration of Ba, duration of Ac =  duration of Ca, etc.  This fact led me to use the same material in matching subsections, often mirrored. In PIANO POEMS 1, 4, 8 and 9 I use this form; although the proportions are all equal, the Abelian shape determines the order. 1 Abelian form (3 X 3 matrix) with overlaps 2 a mirror piece 3 a chance piece: the contents of the four different chords and thir order and the interruptions by the fist rolls were all determined by chance 4 Abelian form (4 X 4 matrix): all sections are four bars long.  Subsection Ab is the mirror of subsection Bb, etc 5 Free form 6 Bogen form: A, B, C, C', B', A', where A' is the augmentation of A, etc 7 Free variations on a short melody 8 Abelian form (3 X 3 matrix): all reptitions are shortened 9 Abelian form (4 X 4 matrix) using fragments from sections 1 to 8 "

On his way to the feast Mahuri was warned of the danger of entering territory controlled by the powerful and dangerous Te Rauparaha whereupon he replied: \"It is the boast of Te Puoho that he will not have his forehead smeared with blood.\" After the feast at which a new kind of food, the pumpkin, was introduced, the guests were invited back to Maimea, at the mouth of the Waikanae River, and massacred - most likely at the prompting of Te Rauparaha.

  general_note: "Waiteata Collection of NZ Music, Volume II; CD WTA002"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: Clairmont Triptych was written in fulfilment of a commission by Chamber Music New Zealand for the Auckland Wind Quintet with pianist David Guerin to perform on a New Zealand tour in 1988. The music derives its inspiration and impetus from the work of the New Zealand painter Phillip Clairmont (1949 - 1984).  He was something of an enfant terrible of the New Zealand art world, living his life and his painting with a reckless passion and energy.  His work is vibrant and strong, conveying an intense and energetic power.  Aspects of these elements are captured in the music, although it is not programmatic, but connects with paintings through analogy and allusion. Amongst the profusion of themes and ideas there are two prominent recurrent subjects in Clairmont's work - the domestic interior and the self portrait.  These form the thematic base of the first two of the three inter-linked movements of the work.  The first movement, Interiors, mirrors the fractured vibrancy of the Clairmont interiors by use of a very fast toccata-like movement in sequences of fluctuating tempo.  This creates a continuously \"flexing\" aural effect which reflects the unsettling quality of the images. The second movement, Self Portraits, uses a recurring three note motif C-B-Bb.  These are the composer's initials (C-H-B in German), thus the self portrait becomes ambiguous.  The music seeks to realise to an extent the technique and viewpoint of the self portraits.  The third movement, Jimi Rocks, refers to the influence of rock music on Clairmont's painting, particularly during his studies and the early part of his career in Christchurch. The three movement formal structure is a musical equivalent of the triptych format Clairmont often used in his painting."

Today, Ponsonby is caught between the glamour of renovation and the excitement of inner city living.    It is a terrain of glossy expensive shops, designer boutiques, bars, restaurants and street caf�s.   The new elegance and romance of historic and modern architecture, living side by side, the hustle and bustle of today's lifestyle and the panoramic harbour views is portrayed in the music."

In the last movement she sings 'I feel air from other planets'. Just as Schoenberg opened a door for classical music with his Second String Quartet, Jamaican dub started the sampling and scratching scene which grooved all the way to 90's Bristol. Clive Randy Chin's \"Easy Come Dub\" is a stripped down remix of The Wailers' \"It Won't Come Easy\". In \"Only You\" from 1997, the Bristol-based band Portishead create an ambient space in which even the \"Inspector Clouseau\" theme finds a new identity. Compressing time and space, 'Secret Arnold' finds room for all three � Schoenberg, Randy and Portishead. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Y2k Pacemaker is an attempt to reflect some of the increasingly frenzied apprehension associated with the coming millennium, and more specifically, the \"year 2000 computer bug\".  Whether computer failures will cause a slight inconvenience or be a major disruption to life seems largely a matter for conjecture.  However, I find the escalating alarm (sometimes exacerbated by scaremongers) and often ensuing bizarre reactions a fascinating aspect of our psychological makeup.  The main idea behind the work is a measured increase in tempo which culminates in some frenetic activity.  The musical texture incorporates ordinary scalic movement and has been derived from a simple octatonic scale.  (The computer on which I wrote this work is 'year 2000 compliant' !)  I would like to thank the Auckland Philharmonia for the opportunity to write \"Y2k Pacemaker\" and have long admired the orchestra's commitment to New Zealand music. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Variations for Violin and Piano' was written in 1982 while Nigel Keay was studying composition at Victoria University of Wellington. The work won the inaugural Composition Competition there in 1982, being played on that occasion by Bruce Corlett (violin) & Hugh Stevenson (piano). It is a single movement work, and although tied in with the formal study requirements of the day, the piece saw the establishment of a personal style and harmonic language that developed along a path of �atonality� during the eighties. In fact the composer considers that this work marks the beginning of his catalogue. Nigel Keay played the violin part of this essentially abstract piece shortly after it was written, reflecting his desire to create a work that would be enjoyed by its performers."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Written in Hiroshima while I was a Master�s student at Elisabeth University of Music, and first performed at my graduation concert from that institution.  The piece opens with the ascending four-note motif from Debussy�s �The Snow is Dancing� from the Children�s Corner suite; gradually the motif is repeated in various ranges of both instruments, followed by soft passages from firstly piano, then violin.  The piece concludes with the transposed motif heard over a chordal ostinato. The piece was influenced in some way by the music of Morton Feldman, whom I was studying at the time.  Published by Wai-te-ata Press Music Editions, Wellington, and released on CD in a performance by Mark Menzies and Dan Poynton, on Wai-te-ata WTA001.  "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This was written out of an admiration for the music of diverse peoples, both Maori and Pakeha, and especially as a tribute to the haunting Nga Iwi E, a song by Hirini Melbourne which celebrates the unity of Pacific (and ultimately all) peoples.  The song merges in and out of a tapestry consisting of fragments of Bach, Beethoven, Maori waiata and others (Keith Jarrett and Jonathan Crayford can both be felt in there too), all structured in a style inspired by Bach's choral preludes.  The underlying melody is a famous song written at the turn of the century by the Maori Princess, Te Rangi Pai. Dedicated to Hirini Melbourne."

They drift over pebbles,  watching us leave them.' "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The text for this work draws on ideas and images from a number of sources, ranging from contemporary poetry to the psalms of the bible.  It is a son of celebration of the Earth and all its abundance.  The initial form of the text was devised by Deirdre McOnie. The work is a joyous song of praise.  More reflective music alternates with rhythmic writing.  Throughout, the music makes much use of syncopation. \"Celebrate the Earth\" was originally written for an overseas competition whose theme was \"A Celebration of Earth Day\".  This revised and orchestrated version was written on a commission from Auckland Choral Society for their 2000 concert season.  It was one of five choral fanfares commissioned for their subscription series.  The concert for which this fanfare was written was to be a Bach 250th anniversary concert.  the scoring is for Baroque orchestra including harpsichord and organ.  Given the nature of the concert I couldn't resist including a short reference to the BACH musical motive (B-flat - A - C - B natural in pitch terms).  It appears in the brief organ solo towards the end of the work. \"Celebrate the Earth!\" is dedicated to the Auckland Choral Society and their conductor Peter Watts.  Its commissioning was made possible by a grant from the Lottery Grants Board.  The first performance took place on 24 March 2000 at Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland. This subsequent version for expanded orchestral forces, including jazz band instruments, was made for Youth arts 2000, a celebration of artistic performances by young people held in Wellington in August 2000.  It was intended as a massed item at the end of the final concert, hence the inclusion of jazz bands in the scoring as well as a large orchestra."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Poem by Bub Bridger   for mixed choir with optional trebles and piano (4 hands)   Bub Bridger started writing poetry after visiting the river which Douglas Bridge spans in Northern Ireland. Johnny Come Dancing was one of her first poems and tells the story of a man's magic encounter with fairies and his subsequent emmigration to New Zealand.  Johnny in the poem was, in fact, Bub Bridger's father, and she assures me the story is true.  The combination of magic and music in the poem appealed to me greatly, and made me want to set it for this commission.  The song uses Irish dance rhythms to underpin the largely modal vocal lines.  The third verse adopts a different style, however,  with reference to the old-style 'glees'(male part-singing).  In the end, the dance rhythms return to drive the music to a climactic ending.   Commissioned by The New Zealand Choral Federation (Otago Branch) for performance at its annual conference in Dunedin, July 1998 "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'The Rose Family' was commissioned by Viva Voce of Auckland and composed in 1995. The theme of roses and some of the texts were chosen by Viva Voce's conductor, John Rosser. The eight songs deal in a fairly light way with a variety of aspects of that most romantic of flowers, from love and happiness through to suffering, pain and death. Edmund Waller's 'Go, lovely rose' is a characteristic idealisation of a young woman and is romantic in style. In Herrick's 'To the Rose', the rose is used to entrap a lover and force her to submit, and the music reflects this cruelty. Dorothy Parker suggests roses are all very well but she would have preferred a new car from her lover. The final song is an arrangement of James Oppenheim's suffragette song 'Bread and Roses', and recalls the the sweated labour of women from the past."

'Tasman Ice' has been performed over the years by various flutists including Uwe Grodd, Alexa Still, Nicola Harris and students at Auckland University. I also performed it at a concert in Japan. As it was published in 'Little Dancings' it has had more performances than I know about which is great. "

The melodic fragment heard at the outset soon skitters over its own unstable surface, mutates into fanfare-like repetitions, is spliced with momentary cantabile inserts, is interrupted by slow motion signposts, and blows itself out in a nal burst of energy."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: \"The boundary between collection and fetishism is mediated by classification and display in tension with accumulation and secrecy.\"  Two musical strands run virtually throughout this short piece, sometimes clearly differentiated, at other times more obscure and confused, but always at some level presenting an opposition between an 'organic', accretional layer and an 'inorganic' abruptly changing one. This opposition can operate not only at surface level - as it does at the beginning, when two highly differentiated instrumental combinations are presented, each with their own characteristic modes of behaviour - but also at a subcutaneous level, when applied to various ways of generating or modifying the basic material.  These concerns form only the technical armature and implementation of the piece, of course, and much of the original musical imagery was suggested by Borges' short story The Circular Ruins. While giving the obligatory (questionable?) disclaimer about the piece in no way being programmatic, much of the mood and atmosphere of the story was certainly in my mind during the initial sketching stages, and it seems to me that its central conceit - one human dreaming another into existence, by sheer will - is a marvellous metaphor for the act of composition."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: A sense of optimism pervades this work - remarkable considering that during the writing of it some of my worst fears were realised. I lost my father and find it hard to reconcile myself to his passing, yet he lives on in me and for that I am grateful.   To Steve and to Edwin I say farewell, too - Steve was a friend, colleague and the bass player in my band, dying tragically young in a road accident the week before my father died.  Edwin Raymond was a significant influence in my teenage years and I am only sorry that I did not write this sooner so he could have conducted it.    The piece is not, however, about death.  It is not gloomy.  The middle movements are reflective and peaceful and the outer movements are lively and rhythmic.  If there is an optimistic side of death it is that life becomes more intense and more meaningful.  The spirit of the finale is testament to this, ending the work vigorously and on an optimistic note.    The concerto was premiered on 7 November 1999 with Carol Hohauser as soloist, accompanied by the Da Capo Chamber Orchestra under conductor Mark Hodgkinson.  The concerto was revised significantly in 2002 for the Russian premiere in May 2002 with the Kuzbass Symphony Orchestra. The work was written for Carol and I thank her for her enthusiasm, musicianship and for believing in my work."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Lullaby for Annabelle  Fast Dance  In memoriam, for Angela  Waltz   The Double Concerto was commissioned by Andrew Uren (bass clarinet) and Katherine Hebley (cello) with funding from Creative New Zealand.  It was designed to explore the unusal combination of solo instruments, extend the soloists and, at the same time, be performable by regional orchestras.   The opening movement has a lilting quality and is based on the Brahms' lullaby, which only appears (abridged) at the end, played on glockenspiel.  The three themes that appear in this movement are related, in some way, to this lullaby.  The movement is dedicated to my daughter Annabelle, who was born some months before the composition of this work. A short melody based on letters from her name (A-A-B-E-E) is played by the soloists in the coda.   By contrast, the second movement is fast and jagged, with a somewhat playful second theme shared between the soloists and woodwinds.  The main theme has a toccata-like quality, and builds up to a strong conclusion.   Whereas birth was the theme behind the first movement, it is death that concerns the third, and in particular the sudden death of a close friend and musician, Angela Campbell, at the time of writing this concerto.  It is an intimate piece for the two soloists only, and based on letters from Angela's name (A-G-E-A) which are heard at the beginning as a recurrent bass line.  The cello melody at the start is a variation on a melody from the first movement, suggesting birth and death are inextricably linked.   The mood lightens in the finale which is a slightly bizarre waltz based on two contrasting themes.  Near the end, the soloists have a cadenza which flows into the coda uninterrupted. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Music plays with time in so many ways - bending it, compressing it, folding it, expanding it...  What role can silence play in this game of temporal illusion?  Apart from its obvious potential as a kind of temporal/sonic punctuation, breaking up the apparently continuous flow of time, silence is pregnant with the potential for reflection - reflection on what has come before and on what may be yet to come.  Taken to an extreme, silence can introduce a kind of entropy into a piece - a long silence can fracture a piece so severly that it functions as an open door, inviting the listener to wander off, away from the world of the composer. But silence is much more than just the absence of sound.  It has a ritualistic aspect.  Think of the minute of silence dedicated to the dead, think of the silence of meditation and prayer that takes us beyond the noise and continuity of quotidian existence.  Perhaps music can be a metaphor for silence on this level.  Perhaps the whole musical work can function as an extended metaphorical silence interrupting our everyday concerns, inviting reflection, turning down the internal dialogue and fading out the conceptual grid."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Symphonic Poem: Ritual Dance of the Unappeasable Shadow' was commissioned by the Dunedin Sinfonia (now called the Southern Sinfonia) in 1993. It is a single movement work based on material from the opera 'At the Hawk's Well'. In some cases there has been extensive reworking, affecting also its construction which follows an arch form with a lively opening and closing. 'Symphonic Poem' was given a workshop reading by the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Sir William Southgate in 1994. This event was recorded by Radio New Zealand's Concert FM. It was also performed by the New Zealand Secondary School's Symphony Orchestra in 1995 as part of its Auckland Course. Peter Adams wrote of the work in a review for the Otago Daily Times (August 1, 1994): \"Nigel Keay's 'Ritual Dance of the Unappeasable Shadow' made a powerful impact on first hearing; the dark core of the work had a brooding intensity while the flanking outer sections were vital and colourful with their Indonesian gamelan-inspired sound world.\" "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: These works (Sinfonia Opus 11a and String Quartet Opus 11b), two versions of the same composition, are a musical autobiography. Ray was born in England and lived through seven years of destruction, spending many nights in air raid shelters listening to the sounds of total war. An air raid, with its sirens, the drone of bombers, bombs dropping and anti-aircraft fire can be heard in the first movement. The main theme, which occurs soon after the opening, reappears inverted after the air raid - symbolic of the utter chaos prevelant at that time. However, like the Phoenix rising from the ashes, the theme not only corrects itself but changes from minor to major modality near the end. The second movement represents New Zealand with its bitter-sweet memories for the composer. New Zealand is a beautiful country. The humerous third movement, called \"England again\" is scored pizzicato throughout, and leads to the final movement \"Canada\" - big Canada, magnificent Canada, vast Canada, noble Canada, free Canada, beautiful Canada.... the huge but simple harmonies near the end are Ray's interpretation of the optimism he feels for the country."

The plaintive, yearning harmonies of the opening Kyrie, contrasts with the joyful sounds of the Gloria and Sanctus. The Credo is a coat of many colours and the final Agnus Dei, composed in the Ionian mode, contains no accidentals - it answers Shoenberg's observation that \"there is still plenty of good music to be written in the key of C\"."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: What happens to us after we die?  This fundamental question has haunted human imagination for thousands of years.  Many recorded accounts of 'near-death' experiences from all over the world provide evidence that human consiousness remains active in the time immediately following death.  These independent accounts describe similar events: the person (or 'spirit') floating above their dead body, the appearance of a great light, being told to go back, and so on.   In 1959, Gina Baxter-Leipolot underwent an emergency operation, was in a coma for three days, and was not expected to recover.  During this time she had a 'near-death' experience in which she was drifting above a Mediterranean coastline.  She heard music, such as the \"velvet sound of of violins, underbroken by a sound like mandolins\" and \"a humming sound, building up in force like thunder\".  Gina remembered the music after she recovered from the coma and twelve years later she wrote the music down in a basic form, with the help of a retired music examiner, John Chew.  She called the music 'Revelations'.   Having been stirred by Gina's story and other 'near-death' accounts, I decided to base my orchestral piece loosely on 'Revelations'.  Gina's music only appears in the coda of the piece, played on celesta and harp.  It is fragmented and interspersed between large orchestral gestures that depict shafts of light.   Revelations begins with human suffering, symbolised by an anguished chromatic motif on the violins.  This is joined by ascending brass chords counterpointed against descending wind chords, as the 'spirit' floats out of the body.  With the entry of the harp the music becomes ethereal, and the flute plays a sinuous, floating melody. A sinister idea is heard on low clarinets, based on the ascending chords.  Following development of these ideas it is the piccolo's turn to play above the harp, as the 'spirit' floats even higher over the sea (symbolised by a static chord, C-D-E).  The music gathers in intensity and at the stroke of a log drum the strings play a fast and dynamic fugato.  This section is turbulent and spiralling, and uses elements from the slow section: the piccolo theme, the low clarinet idea, acsending and descending chords, and thick 'cluster' chords.  Resolution is only found at the start of the coda, where the strings play the static chord C-D-E, and the brass and winds play joyful versions of earlier motifs.  Gina's music then appears, and the piece is rounded off by a blaze of light.  To quote Gina: \"Don't be afraid of death.\" "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Maui Tikitiki a Taranga' (\"Maui formed in the topknot of Taranga\") was a demi-god found in the tribal myths of the Maori people of New Zealand. Maui, the fifth and youngest child, was born at the edge of the sea.  His mother, Taranga, thought he was stillborn, and wrapped him in a tuft of her hair and set him adrift.  He was cared for by the seaweed until a breeze blew him ashore, where he was saved and brought up by one of his great-ancestors. Maui was a great prankster.  In one of his mischievous moods he decided to put out all the fires in the world.  To bring fire back, he had to find Mahuika, the goddess of fire.  He was awestruck upon meeting her, but decided to play a trick on her by taking fire from her fingernails one at a time, until she realised his game and threw fire to the ground, catching everything alight.  Maui changed himself into a hawk to escape the flames, which singed his feathers.  He called upon his ancestor to send rain and drench the fire, depriving Mahuika of her powers. Maui decided to defeat death by journeying to where the earth meets the sky, where lived his great-ancestress Hine nui te po (\"Great Hine the Night\").  He was accompanied by many birds, and told them his plan to enter the body of the sleeping Hine and so defeat death.  The birds sat quietly trying not to laugh as Maui, in the form of a caterpillar, crawled towards Hine.  Suddenly the fantail could be quiet no longer and laughed aloud, dancing about with delight.  Hine awoke with a start, realised Maui's trickery, and he was killed."

Prometheus is seen here as a symbol of those who challenge tyranny for the sake of mankind. By stealing fire from Olympus to give to humans, Prometheus incurred the wrath of Jupiter. He was chained to a rock where, each day, an eagle tore out his liver, and each night it grew whole again. He cursed Jupiter and was hounded by the Furies. Maui stole fire from Mahuika to give to humans and changed himself into an eagle to escape the flames. It is the energy of the curses, the hounding, the wrath of Jupiter, the flight of the eagle, the gift of fire, as well as the compassion of Prometheus and Maui that I have sought to reflect in the music."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In this work, inspired by Paekakariki on the Kapiti Coast -�home� during the composer�s six-week residency at Victoria University in 1989 - the relationship between music and environment is particularly strong.  The cello�s low repeated D, which opens the piece, is the fundamental pitch heard in the sea and the restless semi-quavers evoke the continuous movement of waves crashing on the Paekakariki shore. Whitehead�s fascination with medieval philosophy and music, incorporating concepts of natural cycles, is reflected both in the title and in the compositional process, where magic squares were used to generate the background structure.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: For the composer, 'Fantasia' is a particularly significant work.  It was her first ever commission. Numerous performances in Europe by Tessa Birnie � including a premiere broadcast on Radio Turkey! � led to subsequent performances by other pianists. Displaying a new technical confidence from her studies with Peter Maxwell Davies, the work�s single unified structure marks a turning point in Whitehead�s composing method. The title, refers not so much to free fantasy but to the imagination required to create music from minimal material; in this case - the opening three-note motive.  The work is in three sections, corresponding to these notes, and fabric of the entire piece is generated from them.  There are patterns that emerge within sections, as well as those spanning the entire piece, (trills and tempi changes included).  Because of the inherent symmetry of the generated material, with layers building up both forwards and backwards, Whitehead�s original intention was to make a palindromic structure, but it became instead a through-composed work with coda.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Undoubtedly, this is one of Whitehead�s more unusual collaborations.  The work, intended for five dancers and organ, with soprano added at the composer�s request, was to have been performed in five cathedrals around Britain during the summer of 1982 .  Due to the cancellation of the dance component however, the work received performance in only one of the cathedrals � Carlisle -  but was later presented with a solo dancer, Bronwyn Judge, at the 1987 Sonic Circus in Wellington.  The singer on that occasion was Glenis Johns and the organist Douglas Mews.   The composer initially delayed beginning work on the piece, since her sister was expecting a baby, and a Requiem did not seem an appropriate preoccupation. The successful birth was however followed by two close-family deaths and it was these which provided the composer with the emotional impetus to proceed with the composition.

This experience meant that the writing of this work came naturally. Written while studying in Wellington, the Mass is one of the first of her works that Gillian heard performed; the Victoria University choir conducted by Robert Oliver sang selected movements, while its first complete performance, in an otherwise �all Bach� concert by the Leonine Consort in Sydney, was broadcast on television.  The reviewer of this concert, Roger Covell, wrote �Gillian Whitehead�s Missa Brevis easily rose to the challenge of justifying its presence� (showing) rare understanding of how to write for concerted voices; everything she calculated on paper worked in practice in this tenderly beautiful performance�.

Encountering these sculptures in the British Museum for the first time, I was intrigued to learn that one of the decorative motifs adorning its carved stone form was known as �egg and tongue�. The sensuously rounded forms of eggs and tongues alternate and repeat along the borders of the monumental sculptures, an ancient pattern combining symbols of virility and fertility. The motif is widespread: several years later, walking through the ruined architecture of the Syrian city of Apamea, I found tumbled-down stones of Roman structures bearing this same pattern, rain-washed stones in a field of crocuses.  In the music of �Egg and Tongue�, I play with ideas of patterning and fragmentation, cultural property and style. Familiar motifs repeat, adorn, are lost and take new shapes."

You�d be in deep stew, yes.� � Patti Labelle, Moon Shadow Listening to the Hammond-centred sound of the Peddlers in my parents� car in 1974, I'd feel positively queasy. Ransacking my Dad�s cassette collection a few years, I stumbled across some of this old �driving music�. Somehow I no longer felt nauseous when I listened to it. Around the same time I bought my brother a collection of Rare Groove for his 30th birthday. One of the stand-out tracks is of Patti Labelle singing her version of Cat Stevens� Moonshadow. The central section is an insanely long rant by Labelle in which each of the musicians solo (including a fabulous Hammond improv). Deep Stew takes it title and its spirit from this crazy sequence of �what if�s. Commissioned by the Composers� Association of New Zealand with funds from the QEII Arts Council, Deep Stew was premiered in 1994 at Wellington Town Hall, New Zealand. The Bang on a Can All-Stars gave the work its American premiere in 1995 at New York�s Lincoln Center. The current arrangement is a new revised version written especially for the California EAR Unit."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Recently my curiosity was sparked as to the origins of Maori action songs � a hybrid form combining traditional movements, borrowed Western melodies and Maori lyrics. It seems that I owe my encounter with them to an enthusiastic physical education specialist in the late 1940�s who introduced them into the public school system along with Maori childrens games, noting that they were �exceedingly good for the body of the pakeha� (non-Maori).   W is for is my response to that early time spent dancing and singing in a language which we were never taught to speak. The text is an excerpt from a Maori-English dictionary. It begins at waka (canoe) and passes through wakainga (true home, far distant home) and warawara (yearning), arriving finally at wareware � forget, forgotten, forgetful. The final line comes from the Belgian singer Jacques Brel�s ballad �On n�oublie rien� � you forget nothing. "

The translation from piano to orchestral sounds makes many opportunities for  variety of colours and for real sostenuto.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work was written in 1971 while Watson was the first Mozart fellow at Otago University. It is, in fact, one of his last completed work before his tragically early death in 1973. The three Bagatelles consist of two scherzos framing a slow movement, sub-titled 'ostinato' (repeating bass pattern). Each is quite short but typically complex in style, compressing many motifs and counterpoints into short time frame. They show Watson's interest in serialism which was apparent in his 3rd String Quartet, as well as a Bartokian sound-world in places. The unusual combination of instruments suggests the work was written for specific performers. According to Gordon Skinner, the bagatelles have only been performed once before in 36 years. They are dedicated to artist Michael Smither, who was Hodgkins fellow at the same time as Watson was Mozart Fellow. Following Watson's death, Smither wrote in a tribute: �He was pedantic, spiky, intolerant, abusive and at times quite crazy with drink and depression, yet he was one of the most sympathetic, real men I have ever met, and I loved him.�"

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In 1981 I composed a series of piano pieces called 'Poems of Spring', in which I juxtaposed the exhilarating beauty of a Christchurch spring with the terrible pain of a broken relationship. Ten years later, and in the middle of a cruel Dunedin winter, I recalled this Christchurch spring as I was composing this short piece for the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra. 1991 was a year in which I managed to climb out of a dark phase in my life, and consequently this piece expresses a sense of excitement and affirmation. Lasting  just under 3 minutes, it was designed as a fanfare to open a concert and combines several short motifs into a busy mosaic of sound. 'Yet Another Poem of Spring' is recorded by the NZSO on their 'Landscapes' CD, released by Morrison Music Trust (MMT2037) in 2001. "

These eight pieces use these off-beat qualities in a variety of ways, ranging from sharp opposition to smoother integration. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Sju' is based on the variable pronunciation of this Swedish word. There are two very distinct pronunciations of �sju��one strictly �correct�, another more �colloquial��but also a few shades in between. These distinctions provided me with interesting material, since the difference is mainly one of the initial brief noise component of the word�and even then, the articulations of different people generated a large range of subtly varied noise contours. In shaping the piece I used as a basic model the transition of this noise into pitch (the vowel component), especially the idea of pitched resonances forming a relatively static underpinning of texture, but prone to drift towards new sound shapes. While visiting Sweden in 1998, two of the people I worked with enjoyed using �sju� as a kind of light-hearted Swedish competency test for anglophones�since there is no real equivalent sound in English. My indifferent performance in that test, and my fascination with the bewitching nature of the sounds led me to try and capture and play with them! Dedicated to everyone at EMS Stockholm, with special thanks to Inger, G�ran, Paulina and her class, Perikles and Fivos. 'Sju' was composed in the Electroacoustic music Studios, Victoria University of Wellington and premiered by BEAST, Birmingham, 4 February 2000.

The enormous stress that the lifters place on their bodies and their semiconscious reactions to this stress in the form of grunting, spitting, clenching and howling, is both intriguing and repulsive.  Recordings of these sounds, and sounds generated from these recordings make up part of this piece.  Other sounds come from recordings of squash games, an activity closely related to weightlifting as most gyms have squash courts, but the game is completely different in terms of physical effort verses outcome.  Squash sounds seem to move and dance around quickly and effortlessly while weightlifting sounds are slow and generated only by extreme effort.  On one level, this piece is about physical effort and the odd characters who seek physical perfection."

While on the 'ice', I recorded several sounds, many of which are included in this piece. The work is an attempt to create an expressive work of sonic art that reflects my personal interpretation of the environment of Antarctica and my experiences there.  The Antarctic sounds incorporated into the work are (in order) the sounds of Walking on Snow, Suas, Polar Wind, Radio Communications, Weddell Seals, an Adelie Penguin Rookery and Antarctic White Out. My Antarctic experience is one of the most significant and important experiences of my life.  The various moods, expansive grandeur and majestic ice-scapes of Antarctica have left a deep and enduring impression. With thanks to Antarctic New Zealand, Creative New Zealand and Dr. Joe Waas (University of Waikato) whose recordings of the Weddell Seals augmented my own."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In electroacoustic music the loudspeaker can be thought of as a �veil� isolating our experience of sound from other senses. This allows for a heightened appreciation of the aural dimension and creates a new listening context which Pierre Schaeffer called �acousmatic,� after initiates of Pythagoras who received lectures with their master obscured by a curtain. For me the unique strength of acousmatic music lies in its potential to evoke for us �images� of sound, as imagined reconstructions of sources and scenes, objects and environments as well as its capacity to project hybrid sound-worlds integrating sonic realism and abstract sonority. 'Pythagoras�s Curtain' attempts to develop this aspect of the invisible world of electroacoustic music through sounds of intimately tactile origin. Departing from the �imagery� these sounds might conjure (the hands, their gestures and their influence on sound-making objects) aspects of the structure of these sounds are electroacoustically �re-designed� in ways that seek to obscure source recognition yet also retain a semblance of the motivating gestural energies and physical interactions. Through the emergence of this wider musical context, another Pythagorean veil (of abstraction) forms as a sense of realistic �cause and effect� becomes increasingly remote. 'Pythagoras's Curtain' was realised in the studios of De Montfort University, Leicester and premiered on April 4th 2001 in the White Concert Hall at the Conservatory of Music, University of Missouri-Kansas City."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Inner' extends out of the sound and sensation of human breath � from a visceral and magnified perspective. The starting point was concentrated listening to some straightforward electroacoustic transformations of breath sound. Because the spectrum of the sound is rich and noisy, as well as capable of being articulated with seemingly infinite variety, it felt almost as though a whole world of new sound identities might be heard 'within' a single breath sound itself. So following that idea I tried to draw attention to the way vowel-like colourations and the rhythmic contours of the breath can be developed and related across a range of noise-based gestures and textures. In seeking to anchor the sound transformations against recognisable sound, the gesture of the opening intake of breath became a key figure, hinting at a surface of realism during some of the more abstract extensions of the material. But perhaps one of the most important motivations for me as composer was the innate potential of the electroacoustic medium to exaggerate the apparent physical scale and presence of such a very intimate and personal sound. Along with 'Virtual', and 'Time, Motion and Memory', this work forms an integrated sequence of three electroacoustic works exploring movement between sound sources which are 'internal' and 'external' to human sensibility. 'Inner' was realised in the Electroacoustic Music Studios of Victoria University of Wellington and premiered at Concordia University, Montr�al in February 1996. The work was awarded first prize in the 1996 Stockholm Electronic Arts Award."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Virtual' attempts to convey the idea of an illusory soundscape set in vibrant motion by the wind�an invisible and capricious source of energy for the �virtual� objects in the space, the exact nature of which we are left to imagine. This idea extended partly out of my fascination with the process of making field recordings in the natural environment, where the wind is typically regarded as a pervasive and problematic intruder. But, in fact, the wind is often a part of the sonic signature of a place (especially in the notoriously windy city I was living in when I composed this piece). So I set out to record wind �noise� trying to take advantage of the very active stereo play it produces across a pair of microphones (just as it does across our ear canals). Other sound identities were designed around this idea, mostly derived from turbulent air streams and tube resonances. I also attempted to give some of these complex sound shapes something of the spectral colouration of the human breathing, in an attempt to set up a sense of inanimate sounds taking on more animate behaviour. Linked to this are some characteristic patterns of spatial morphology within which these sounds evolve and transform. 'Virtual' was realised in the Electroacoustic Music Studios of Victoria University of Wellington and premiered there on April 24th 1997. The work was awarded an honorary mention in the 1997 Prix Ars Electronica, Special Mention in the 1997 Prix Noroit-L�once Petitot and pre-selected in the 1997 Bourges International Competition for electroacoustic music."

Its gentle motion and plaintive sound opened for me a very intimate world of contemplation, fantasy and imagination. This piece could be thought of as a sonic environment in which transformations of the swing's sound trigger dream-like associations and surrealistic juxtapositions of sound-images�where the co-existence of many sonic references might mirror the imagination�s freedom to form unusual and tenuously sketched connections. While the swing remains relatively �fixed� in space, other environmentally based sounds cut across its presence, and the swing itself is gradually transformed towards the sound image of a giant pendulum. 'Time, Motion and Memory' was realised in the Electroacoustic Music Studios of Victoria University of Wellington and premiered there on February 26th 1998."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work is an exploration of the sound-image of rain. In many ways, I felt the process of composing this piece to be one of revealing and expanding the myriad patterns and colours within the sound, normally noticeable only with very concentrated listening. Since I work exclusively with my own environmental recordings, I tend to see the compositional process as opening out of the richness of the act of listening itself, supported by the imaginative associations for which it can be a catalyst. Like many environmental sources, the sound of rain is extremely varied and, at least in theory, covers a whole range of morphologies from the individual droplet to saturated granular noise. In collecting source material I made numerous field recordings in different locations focusing on the sound of rain falling on different objects�such as leaves, windows and puddles�since it was clear that the variety of sound colours inherent in rain is largely defined by the nature of the surface it falls upon. In processing these sounds, I tried to think about these distinctions: the �granular� aspect tending towards long-term development of texture, and the �droplets� providing models for attack-resonance structures. But in continuing with this idea, my approach was not always subtle! In the studio I tried to expand the gestural rhythm by superimposing the dramatic amplitude envelopes of fireworks onto the dense textures of heavy rain. And, with the use of multiple grouped resonators, I was able to impose defined pitch structures onto the material, allowing slowly evolving inharmonic spectra to eventually have a central role in the piece. As a whole, Liquid Sky aims to convey the feeling of a larger-than-life immersion in rain, and an intensified view of a powerful environmental phenomenon. 'Liquid Sky' was realised in the studios of the Groupe de recherches musicales, Paris and EMS Stockholm. Collection of sound sources and some initial processing was done at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver. The work was commissioned by the Ina-GRM and premiered in the GRM's Multiphonies series, Salle Olivier Messiaen, Maison de Radio France, Paris, March 20th 2000. It was pre-selected in the 2000 Bourges International Competition for electroacoustic music."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In these pieces for a �chamber grouping� of just three gamelan instruments, I used as the basis for composition a combined scale made up of pelog and slendro.  The first piece combines a repeated ostinato and melody in a laid-back �bluesy� kind of way.  The second piece is a wholly serial composition consisting of a repeated cycle; the three performers play each note of their instrument once only (making a complete cycle) before again the notes are played in the same order, although the ensemble can be varied in the subsequent repetition.   Written for Wellington�s Gamelan Padhang Moncar to perform at the Beat International Festival of Gamelan held in Wellington in 1999, and recorded on CD by them on Portal 1001/2.  "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This song cycle was written as a thankyou piece for Lesley Graham, who had sung lead roles in Harris� operas 'Waituhi' (1984) and 'Tanz der Schw�ne' (1989). She suggested Bub Bridger�s texts. As with 'Dreams Yellow Lions', the poems are couched in the vernacular, in this case with a disarmingly na�ve, yet subtle character. The composer saw the challenge here in writing music that was both simple and rich in order to match the subtleties of the text."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Duo' is a set of variations on the twisting melody introduced by the violin at the beginning. A short ricochet motif soon appears, completely unexpectedly, disrupting the flow of the music. This interjection returns over and over, spurring the work on into the allegro section where it infects the melody and appears as the repeated note motif. Gradually the music accelerates until the new motif is almost as fast as the original ricochet. At this point the ricochet is revealed in its original form and the piece shudders to a grinding halt. 'Duo' is the second piece Harris has written for Rolf and Helena, following Wayleggo which was given to them by the composer as a wedding present. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Written at Waikanae beach, 'Variation' was inspired by the natural environment. Rapidly evolving, elaborate patterns are a feature of the work. Chromatic textures reflect wind and surf, swirling, then pause for breath before hurtling off again, intentionally avoiding metered structures. Harris has always viewed the work as a �New Zealand piece�, although commentators from the period labelled it as belonging to the European art music tradition. The artist�s response: �I was thinking about New Zealand things. Sea, wind��. David Guerin gave the first performance of 'Variation' in 1982, but the technical challenges of the work have meant that it has seen few performances since."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The German poet Rilke has long been a favourite of both Ross and his wife, Barbro, who first drew his attention to the poems. In describing the work, Harris comments: �The world my settings evoke is romantic, nostalgic, angst ridden; qualities which suit so well Susan�s voice and temperament. They are a little bit Mahlerian I suppose; some people say Webern, but I don�t really think so, although they are a little bit fragmentary. I wrote them so quickly that they just follow the text. �Whatever I do, I always write lines. All the music is linear, whatever the style. Even the chord progressions are going to be linear, whether harmony is important or not. This means the music is goal oriented, even if the goal is never reached; which is actually quite good for expressing what Rilke is about.�"

It was in a programme with Mozart and I thought it would be quite fun to have the audience believe that they were going to hear a classical piece.� This is soon subverted as chromaticism takes over and the music explodes into 16 solo lines. The form of 'Sinfonietta' is unusual, in that it is loudest at the ends and empty in the middle. Out of the central calm is revealed the twelve tone melody that was the original inspiration for the piece. This gradually grows, taking the work back to its original intensity. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Commissioned for the opening of the new National Library building in 1987, this work was the centre piece in a concert of New Zealand music which inaugurated the Library�s auditorium. Harris chose Alistair Campbell�s poetry as he has always enjoyed its vernacular quality. Included in the ensemble are some of Harris� favourite instruments: soprano saxophone, bass clarinet and flugelhorn. Harris views this work almost as a kind of unstaged melodrama. As with his 'To the Memory of I.S. Totska' (2000), 'Dreams Yellow Lions' was written in a period between work on his operas and acts as a substitute for the larger compositional form. Short instrumental interludes link the songs through various emotional states. �It�s all about memories and I always imagine an old man thinking about his younger days, dreaming away, getting old and becoming sick�."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Lilburn composed these songs in 1958 for the baritone Donald Munro and his wife the violist Jean McCartney, who gave the first broadcast performance.  The influence of serialism on the composer�s style at this point in his career makes for a challenging vocal line, especially in the first two songs.  Nonetheless, Lilburn�s work capitalizes on the affinities between voice and viola, and exploits technical capabilities of the viola to evoke moods rather than painting the words.  In the penultimate verse of �Warning of Winter�, for example, the viola�s wavering line, thickened with chords, heralds the darkness of winter that �descends the flowered pathway�.  Such subtle evocation of the text is also found in �Blow, Wind of Fruitfulness�.  Here the viola�s wide leaps to high trills are to be executed with the bow placed over the fingerboard; this evokes the troubling paradoxes of spring, the �Birds that are silent now/And buds of barren springing�.  Between these bleak poles, the viola and voice pairing are used with bold irony in �Song of Allegiance�.  This march is a poet�s humble yet robust reflection on his own position in comparison to the poetic geniuses of the past.  Again Lilburn enlists the viola to speak with and as the poet: wide intervals, tense chords, and motivic stutters convey a poetic voice that is �cracked and harsh�."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Viola Concerto was written while Ritchie was Composer-in-Residence with the Dunedin Sinfonia in 1994, and first performed in Dunedin the following year, with Donald Maurice as the soloist.  It is a personal work in which the viola takes on various characters, and describes human relationships.  The solo part speaks in a natural and uncontrived voice, and consequently there are few shows of virtuosity in the concerto.   The first movement, allegro tempestuoso, opens in turmoil and includes an idea inspired by one of Bach's Brandenburg concertos.  A lighter, folk-like theme emerges and acts as a link to the second main theme which is cooler in mood and tinged with sadness.  In the middle section a new idea is played on muted brass interspersed with a lyrical melody on viola. Themes are developed in the orchestra, reaching a climax and leading back to the home key of E.  At this point melodic ideas are transformed by a downward, 'weeping' motif which appeared earlier on.  This carthartic passage fades and the movement ends quickly, without resolution.   The long theme at the start of the slow movement began life as a solo piece, and unfolds slowly on the dorian mode accompanied by simple string chords.  The stronger second theme on G has a determined quality about it.  A lyrical third theme appears on the woodwinds and uses elements of the opening melody.  Ominous rumbles in the bass signify the start of the middle section. A boisterous climax evaporates into the recapitulation, where the opening melody is varied with soft floating flutes and string harmonics. The third movement, a cadenza, follows and acts as a link to the finale.   Dance-like in character, the finale provides a resolution to the tensions of the previous movements.  Some of the themes are influenced by popular music styles, and near the end there is a slightly slower section which recalls Bluegrass music; this was inspired by the American group, the Blue Sky Mountain Boys.  There are three main themes in the movement, and these are combined in counterpoint towards the end.  A long pedal note E appears in the Coda, over which the soloist plays a mock-heroic version of the second theme.  This is brusquely swept aside by strident and jazzy chords, and the concerto comes to a conclusion. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: These works (Sinfonia Opus 11a and String Quartet Opus 11b), two versions of the same composition, are a musical autobiography. Ray was born in England and lived through seven years of destruction, spending many nights in air raid shelters listening to the sounds of total war. An air raid, with its sirens, the drone of bombers, bombs dropping and anti-aircraft fire can be heard in the first movement. The main theme, which occurs soon after the opening, reappears inverted after the air raid - symbolic of the utter chaos prevelant at that time. However, like the Phoenix rising from the ashes, the theme not only corrects itself but changes from minor to major modality near the end. The second movement represents New Zealand with its bitter-sweet memories for the composer. New Zealand is a beautiful country. The humerous third movement, called \"England again\" is scored pizzicato throughout, and leads to the final movement \"Canada\" - big Canada, magnificent Canada, vast Canada, noble Canada, free Canada, beautiful Canada.... the huge but simple harmonies near the end are Ray's interpretation of the optimism he feels for the country."

Ray was born in England and lived through seven years of destruction, spending many nights in air raid shelters listening to the sounds of total war. An air raid, with its sirens, the drone of bombers, bombs dropping and anti-aircraft fire can be heard in the first movement. The main theme, which occurs soon after the opening, reappears inverted after the air raid - symbolic of the utter chaos prevelant at that time. However, like the Phoenix rising from the ashes, the theme not only corrects itself but changes from minor to major modality near the end. The second movement represents New Zealand with its bitter-sweet memories for the composer. New Zealand is a beautiful country. The humerous third movement, called \"England again\" is scored pizzicato throughout, and leads to the final movement \"Canada\" - big Canada, magnificent Canada, vast Canada, noble Canada, free Canada, beautiful Canada.... the huge but simple harmonies near the end are Ray's interpretation of the optimism he feels for the country."

Prometheus is seen here as a symbol of those who challenge tyranny for the sake of mankind. By stealing fire from Olympus to give to humans, Prometheus incurred the wrath of Jupiter. He was chained to a rock where, each day, an eagle tore out his liver, and each night it grew whole again. He cursed Jupiter and was hounded by the Furies. Maui stole fire from Mahuika to give to humans and changed himself into an eagle to escape the flames. It is the energy of the curses, the hounding, the wrath of Jupiter, the flight of the eagle, the gift of fire, as well as the compassion of Prometheus and Maui that I have sought to reflect in the music."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Maui Tikitiki a Taranga' (\"Maui formed in the topknot of Taranga\") was a demi-god found in the tribal myths of the Maori people of New Zealand. Maui, the fifth and youngest child, was born at the edge of the sea.  His mother, Taranga, thought he was stillborn, and wrapped him in a tuft of her hair and set him adrift.  He was cared for by the seaweed until a breeze blew him ashore, where he was saved and brought up by one of his great-ancestors. Maui was a great prankster.  In one of his mischievous moods he decided to put out all the fires in the world.  To bring fire back, he had to find Mahuika, the goddess of fire.  He was awestruck upon meeting her, but decided to play a trick on her by taking fire from her fingernails one at a time, until she realised his game and threw fire to the ground, catching everything alight.  Maui changed himself into a hawk to escape the flames, which singed his feathers.  He called upon his ancestor to send rain and drench the fire, depriving Mahuika of her powers. Maui decided to defeat death by journeying to where the earth meets the sky, where lived his great-ancestress Hine nui te po (\"Great Hine the Night\").  He was accompanied by many birds, and told them his plan to enter the body of the sleeping Hine and so defeat death.  The birds sat quietly trying not to laugh as Maui, in the form of a caterpillar, crawled towards Hine.  Suddenly the fantail could be quiet no longer and laughed aloud, dancing about with delight.  Hine awoke with a start, realised Maui's trickery, and he was killed."

A \"fanfare\", however, conjures up visions of red-coated trumpeters standing majestically in a row and playing as loudly as possible!  An orchestral fanfare to open a concert is an unusual animal, somewhat akin to the \"concerto for orchestra\", and can happily be left open to interpretation by the lucky composer who gets to write one. Fanfare for a City begins with a brief opening brass chorale hinting at things to come, a fanfare with a sense of excitement and jubilation culminating in a return to the opening chorale written in Bach style that would never have been written by Bach.  Fanfare for a City was commissioned by Symphony Australia for the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra's 2001 subscription series."

  general_note: "Ritchie A.: Remember Parihaka; cassette"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: The starting point for this piece was a curiosity in the metal doors that covered the entrances to cells imbedded in the cliffs near Andersons Bay inlet, in Dunedin. A friend informed me that during the 19th century Maori prisoners were kept there at night, and worked on the Dunedin Harbour land reclamation during the day. Some of these prisoners were brought down to Dunedin from Taranaki in the North Island, as a result of the conflict in 1881 at Parihaka. Upon reading Dick Smith's book 'Ask that Mountain - The story of Parihaka' I learned of one of the most shocking incidents in our country's history. The land wars of the 1860s provoked a new approach from Maori to the protection of their lands. Te Whiti, Tohu and their followers at Parihaka combated the Pakeha land grab by organising passive resistance through a variety of means. In response to unauthorised land confiscation Te Whiti ordered the ploughing of fields, building of fences and planting, all of which impeded the surveyors who wished to carve up the land for settlers. Many were arrested, offering no struggle, and soon prisons around the country were full. Despite the many injustices Te Whiti maintained his policy of passive resistance to the end. In November 1881, government troops entered Parihaka with guns and artillery. They were greeted by Maori women and children chanting songs, but no armed struggle. Te Whiti and Tohu were taken away, the Pa was broken up, and hundreds sent away to prison. Despite a Press blackout, two reporters were smuggled into the Pa, one commenting that \"it was one of the saddest and most painful spectacles I have witnessed\". 'Remember Parihaka' attempts to sum up my thoughts and feelings about the events at Parihaka. The slow opening is peaceful, like a sun rise, with melodic fragments that slowly unfold into a fuller, more passionate statement. Flutes and oboes announce a chant-like theme, based on an actual song composed at the time of the incident. This 'Maori' theme alternates with a more European-sounding theme on solo violin, accompanied by an Irish drum, the bowron. At the heart of the piece the various melodic ideas come together over a grinding, relentless bass, building to a climax. In the short postlude, the peace of the opening is suggested, but now it is tinged with sadness, and a slightly uneasy feeling. This 9-minute piece was written while I was Composer-in-residence with the Southern Sinfonia, in 1994. It was first performed in that year, under the baton of John Hopkins."

The atmosphere of the Victorian period, with the ballroom and spacious grounds, is captured in this music.   The powerful brass chords show the strong character of Allan Kerr Taylor, owner and builder of this stately home.  The spirits of the three unmarried daughters, the last family residents, are solo woodwind features.  The shimmering tremolo string passages and harp arpeggios depict the 'ghostly' games played by Aunt Muriel on the children. "

While hoping to reconnect to a lost time and culture, the archaeologists succeeded in cracking several of the instruments. More careful study revealed that the flutes were tuned to �familiar� scales, enabling their former owners to play �perhaps even music�. A researcher then performed a Chinese folk tune, Little Cabbage, on one of the flutes. Xiao Bai Cai is the heartfelt lament of a child usurped by a stepmother and new stepbrother: �pale on the ground�, Little Cabbage weeps for the past.   With its mixture of carelessness, optimism and nostalgic yearning for times past, this story fascinates me. In 9,000 years time, what will other beings make of the crumbling remains of violins, flutes and double basses? 'Pale on the Ground' is an invented music built on the imagined ruins of our own fragile culture."

In 'Stitching in the Ditch' this notion of pulling extremes together resonates on a musical level � my sound inspirations come from construction sites (pneumatic drills, hand saws, pile drivers), classical repertoire (Debussy's La Mer), and instrument tuning (the organ of St Thomas' Church in Leipzig). Images that at first seem miles apart  start to swim towards each other."

It seems that I owe my encounter with them to an enthusiastic physical education specialist in the late 1940�s who introduced them into the public school system along with Maori childrens games, noting that they were �exceedingly good for the body of the pakeha� (non-Maori).   W is for is my response to that early time spent dancing and singing in a language which we were never taught to speak. The text is an excerpt from a Maori-English dictionary. It begins at waka (canoe) and passes through wakainga (true home, far distant home) and warawara (yearning), arriving finally at wareware � forget, forgotten, forgetful. The final line comes from the Belgian singer Jacques Brel�s ballad �On n�oublie rien� � you forget nothing. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Poems of a Bright Moon' for flute/alto flute, clarinet and piano was inspired by the Hsiang-Yang Songs of Li Po, an 8th-century Chinese poet of the T'ang Dynasty (ca.618-906 A.D.).  On a visit to New Mexico in the United States, the discovery of the poet William Carlos Williams and the art work of Georgia O'Keeffe led to the poetry of Li Po, which conjures up visions of mountains and rivers, also very much part of the New Mexico landscape.  Li Po was something of a mischievous travelling minstrel and liked to indulge in the drink somewhat.  A legend says that �while out drunk in a boat, he fell into a river and drowned trying to embrace the moon.�   The moon appears in over a third of his poems, and the opportunity to combine Li Po's images of moonlight with the rich dark tones of the alto flute was irresistible.  The individual titles of the movements of this piece come directly from the poems, and the music attempts to evoke the spirit of the titles: �Hsien mountain rises above emerald Han river,� �On a moonlit night, a recluse plays his pale white ch'in� and �A pure ten-thousand-mile wind arrives.�  'Poems of a Bright Moon' was commissioned by Ethos trio with funding assistance from Creative New Zealand."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Music plays with time in so many ways - bending it, compressing it, folding it, expanding it...  What role can silence play in this game of temporal illusion?  Apart from its obvious potential as a kind of temporal/sonic punctuation, breaking up the apparently continuous flow of time, silence is pregnant with the potential for reflection - reflection on what has come before and on what may be yet to come.  Taken to an extreme, silence can introduce a kind of entropy into a piece - a long silence can fracture a piece so severly that it functions as an open door, inviting the listener to wander off, away from the world of the composer. But silence is much more than just the absence of sound.  It has a ritualistic aspect.  Think of the minute of silence dedicated to the dead, think of the silence of meditation and prayer that takes us beyond the noise and continuity of quotidian existence.  Perhaps music can be a metaphor for silence on this level.  Perhaps the whole musical work can function as an extended metaphorical silence interrupting our everyday concerns, inviting reflection, turning down the internal dialogue and fading out the conceptual grid."

  general_note: "Ritchie A.: Revelations; cassette"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: What happens to us after we die?  This fundamental question has haunted human imagination for thousands of years.  Many recorded accounts of 'near-death' experiences from all over the world provide evidence that human consiousness remains active in the time immediately following death.  These independent accounts describe similar events: the person (or 'spirit') floating above their dead body, the appearance of a great light, being told to go back, and so on.   In 1959, Gina Baxter-Leipolot underwent an emergency operation, was in a coma for three days, and was not expected to recover.  During this time she had a 'near-death' experience in which she was drifting above a Mediterranean coastline.  She heard music, such as the \"velvet sound of of violins, underbroken by a sound like mandolins\" and \"a humming sound, building up in force like thunder\".  Gina remembered the music after she recovered from the coma and twelve years later she wrote the music down in a basic form, with the help of a retired music examiner, John Chew.  She called the music 'Revelations'.   Having been stirred by Gina's story and other 'near-death' accounts, I decided to base my orchestral piece loosely on 'Revelations'.  Gina's music only appears in the coda of the piece, played on celesta and harp.  It is fragmented and interspersed between large orchestral gestures that depict shafts of light.   Revelations begins with human suffering, symbolised by an anguished chromatic motif on the violins.  This is joined by ascending brass chords counterpointed against descending wind chords, as the 'spirit' floats out of the body.  With the entry of the harp the music becomes ethereal, and the flute plays a sinuous, floating melody. A sinister idea is heard on low clarinets, based on the ascending chords.  Following development of these ideas it is the piccolo's turn to play above the harp, as the 'spirit' floats even higher over the sea (symbolised by a static chord, C-D-E).  The music gathers in intensity and at the stroke of a log drum the strings play a fast and dynamic fugato.  This section is turbulent and spiralling, and uses elements from the slow section: the piccolo theme, the low clarinet idea, acsending and descending chords, and thick 'cluster' chords.  Resolution is only found at the start of the coda, where the strings play the static chord C-D-E, and the brass and winds play joyful versions of earlier motifs.  Gina's music then appears, and the piece is rounded off by a blaze of light.  To quote Gina: \"Don't be afraid of death.\" "

King Orfeo is unusual in that it is based on the Greek legend of Orpheus, who now plays the bagpipes rather than the lute; and doubly usual in that it has a happy ending with Orfeo rescuing his Isabel. The other two ballads are more typical in their themes of darkness and death. Lord Randal's story is told in dialogue with his mother; it is interesting that another dialogue-ballad, Edward, was set by Schubert towards the end of his life. These settings also exist in a version for voice and orchestra"

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The title suggests a mixed metaphor, the organic alongside the astronomical. Although the words arrived late in the process, they go some way towards describing the forces at work. Propelled by small-scale rhythmic articulation, strands reach out towards points, tracing delicate spirals through space. Alongside these sit diffuse clouds of material, out of which new constellations take shape. There is above all a concern with the intimate connection between the gestures of performance and their sonic result. The instruments act as filters which shape raw sound in a manner reminiscent of the procedures of the electroacoustic studio. There is a constant tension between organic direction and quite arbitrary frameworks, a mesh of non-congruent processes operating on different structural levels. In front of this, the intricate detail of the audible surface attempts to impose perceptual order on the precariously balanced network of forces."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In contrast to the singular, organic process of solo for cello this piece plays with the idea of juxtaposing contrasting fragments of material. It was stimulated by a book of dream symbols, in the form of simple gouache paintings, originating in the Rajasthan Gujarat area of Western India in the early 19th century.  The book is one of any number of dream lexicons to be found in ancient eastern cultures that guided the interpretation of dreams using mythological and cultural symbols pertaining to fortune and destiny. Although the Rajasthan Gujarat lexicon informs aspects of the aesthetic of the piece, it is not intended that the music function as an illustration of the visual images themselves.  Rather: whereas the pictures seek to make concrete the ephemeral matter of the dream, the music embodies an attempt both to restore the subjective nature of the dreamscape and to reconstruct the grammar of its articulation in time - concentrated, disjunct and fleeting. This occurs perhaps in the way that one might attempt to reconstruct a paragraph in an archaic language from its written symbols, without having access to their original source or context, guided only by intuitions based on experience of one's own language - in this case the 'language' of the dream. The title of the piece is borrowed from one of the images of the Rajasthan Gujarat lexicon. Water Mountain was composed for Apartment House 1999. It has been performed in Reading, New Zealand (175E ensemble 2002), Seoul (ACL festival 2003) and Brighton (Soundwaves festival, 2007) and broadcast by Radio NZ."

This third piece was written with a line from Federico Garcia Lorca's lament for the bullfighter Ignacio Sanchez Mejias in mind: �Bones and flutes sound in his ears�."

Prometheus is seen here as a symbol of those who challenge tyranny for the sake of mankind. By stealing fire from Olympus to give to humans, Prometheus incurred the wrath of Jupiter. He was chained to a rock where, each day, an eagle tore out his liver, and each night it grew whole again. He cursed Jupiter and was hounded by the Furies. Maui stole fire from Mahuika to give to humans and changed himself into an eagle to escape the flames. It is the energy of the curses, the hounding, the wrath of Jupiter, the flight of the eagle, the gift of fire, as well as the compassion of Prometheus and Maui that I have sought to reflect in the music."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In Procession I use several unorthodox playing techniques on the gamelan.  The tunings of pelog and slendro are combined freely throughout; the piano remains tuned as is usual (well-tempered chromatic).  The instruments are not dampened, but are left to ring on while subsequent notes are played, giving the effect of clouds of sound.  Compositionally as well the piece is not at all conventional, but explores the gamelan in different ways both harmonically and melodically.   In the first movement this is through combining the close intervals between the pelog and slendro modes; in �Quartet� through step-wise ascending movement; in the fifth movement, a transcription of a short Liszt Ave Maria, the gamelan approximates the triadic harmonies of the piano original.  The third movement, Melody in Pelog and Slendro, is closest to a traditional Javanese composition, although here the free intermingling of the two modes creates an unusual effect.  As well, various instruments are used in atypical ways- the Gong in the first movement struck with an open palm and functioning as a rhythmic marker, or the kempul in the third movement acting as an ostinato; over this rebab and gender elaborate melodic patterns combining the two tunings. The piano is sometimes used as a timbral device (as in the opening movement) and sometimes more in a melodic manner, as in the �Finale�.  Composed for pianist Dan Poynton and Gamelan Padhang Moncar of Victoria University of Wellington, who gave the first performance at the Composers� Association of New Zealand 20th Birthday celebrations in Wellington in November 1994.   Recorded by the same artists on Tabuh Pacific (Ode Record Company, CD Manu 1514).  Movement II, �Quartet� appears on the Centre for New Zealand Music (SOUNZ) Guide for Schools �SOUNZwrite Ears Wide Open Education Resource� CD, while Movement V Ave Maria is on the double CD issued by the New Zealand Geographic in their December 2006 issue featuring New Zealand composers."

  general_note: "Ritchie A.: Symphony No.2 (The Widening Gyre); CD"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: The three movements of the symphony are:  I - 'Stratagem of Trumpets'  III - 'Mi-1st'  IIII - 'Double Helix'    \"Turning and turning in the widening gyre  The falcon cannot hear the falconer;  Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  Mere anarchy is loosed on the world . . .\"   from \"The Second Coming\" by W. B. Yeats   When asked to compose a work on the meaning and symbolism of the new Millenium I decided to use William Butler Yeats' famous poem \"The Second Coming\" as a starting point.  Written in 1921, when the old order in Europe was breaking down, it suggests a revolution or rotation in history (the gyre) will bring about a 'second coming' of an important historical figure, and the dawn of a new Millenium.  Yeats' vision of the new world order to come is not, however, optimistic.  He sees the coming of a 'rough beast' with a 'lion body and the head of a man', a cold and heartless creature that might be equated with certain infamous and autocratic leaders in the 20th century.   The 'gyre' or revolution is represented in the symphony by a rolling, sliding timpani sound, accompanied by bass drum and tam tam at the start of the work.  This idea becomes an important motif and appears at the very start.  Following the 'gyre', we hear a 'life and death' theme that begins like a cradle song (the birth of Christ), rises, and then twists downwards in a chromatic line.  This theme provides most of the material for what follows.   The slow introduction climaxes with hammer blows, a reference to the death of Christ. From this a trumpet call emerges, becoming a significant motif later in the movement.   In the allegro that follows, the 'life and death' theme is transformed into a fast and restless melody, beginning as pizzicato on the strings.  Complimenting this is a macabre and folky theme on muted trumpet and clarinets, evoking a sort of frenzied, gyrating dance.  The music quietens and a lyrical theme appears on flute, accompanied by timpani and harp and developed by the strings.  As the music climaxes again, the trumpet call reappears, shared around other brass instruments.  The significance of this trumpet call can be seen with reference to another poem, this time by New Zealander Peggy Dunstan:   Stratagem of Trumpets   \"Then the trumpets sounded  Not in a flare of pomp and pageantry  But with a golden lilting laughter  That seemed to open up the sky  So that the music dropped like rain  Upon the upturned faces  And the enchanted ears were closed  To everything except those throbbing notes. . . \"   The trumpets distract the listeners, and make them unaware of the advancing enemy.  Dunstan's poem goes on to describe a massacre of Serbs in 1389 at the time of the battle of Kosovo between Serbs and Turks.  At the time of composing my symphony Kosovo was once again in the grip of war and atrocity, only this time the Serbs were the aggressors and Albanians were the victims.  It seems to me that Kosovo sums up a situation common in our past Millenium: an endless cycle of struggle for land and power, costing many innocent lives.   In the music, the log drum heralds a sort of 'musical battle-field' in which the 'life and death' theme becomes an aggressive, jagged idea, used fugally in an increasingly dissonant texture.  Following the 'battle', solo strings, piccolo and harp provide a brief lament for the dead and the music returns to the music of the Introduction.  This time it is mixed fragments of the flute theme, and the movement ends quietly with the 'gyre' motif.   If the first movement represents the past, then the second movement is a comment on the present.  The title 'Mi-1st' refers to the heavy emphasis on the note E (or Mi in the sol-fa system) as a central pitch, but can also be interpreted as 'me-first'.  Essentially this music is about the natural human tendency to be self-centred, which I believe has become much more prevalent in our own society.  It is perhaps one aspect of Yeats' 'rough beast' that hinders our progress.   There are three main ideas in this presto movement.  The first is a savage chromatic theme that encircles the note E, played initially on strings. It is immediately followed by a vigorous, syncopated theme on strings and winds.  As a contrast, the harp accompanies a quieter, smoother theme on the violins, which also includes the twisting, chromatic motif from the first movement.  In the middle, the music becomes increasingly chaotic until a climax on C is reached, with hope for resolution to the discords.  However, the music slips into the key of B, and the strings play a restless, anxious version of the contrast theme.  The frenetic energy of the first part gradually dissipates, and the movement collapses into a web of solo violins.  The 'gyre' motif has the final say.   There are a number of themes in the third movement, but all evolve in some way or other from the constantly twisting, turning melodic line that appears at the start.  Used in close canon, this melody represents the intertwining DNA molecule, and hence the title of the movement, 'Double Helix'.  Discovered recently in our history, genetics are sure to have a highly significant role in the future.  This music looks forward with the hope that genetics will be used in a positive way.  It also acknowledges that we carry with us the characteristics of previous generations (covering a whole Millenium and more!), and that the future will be significantly shaped by these characteristics. At the same time we need to learn from the hard lessons of previous generations in order to make progress.  Consequently, the symphony has an optimistic and celebratory end, which is tempered by a sense of warning.  In the coda, the threads of 'Double Helix' motifs are combined with a return of the main theme from the first movement, played on full brass.   Dedicated to Sandy  "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Sinew/Synapse' is concerned with ideas of connection: the causal links between brain and body, score and sound, performance gesture and sonic result. The musical materials existed first as independent objects, which were then manipulated to draw out links between them. I was particularly interested in areas in which the acoustical systems of the instrument become unstable, where a precisely specified physical gesture will produce an unpredictable sonic result. Many of the sounds hover around the threshold of audibility, and the performer is constantly involved in a delicate balancing act. 'Sinew/Synapse' is dedicated to the cellist Robert Ibell, whose role in the music�s evolution was invaluable."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Dedicated to my father, who died in 1999, the requiem (in nomine patris) started off as an optimistic work, a celebration of life rather than as a morbid fixation on loss.  However, the reality of loss and the anger that comes with it soon began to take over the work.  It was only after several months of constant revision that any sense of lyricism began to shine through.   In the forefront of my mind were my friends Jenny Rowe, Patrick Beraud, Steve Johnson and Judi Pattinson, all bright lights no longer with us but whose spirits live on.  They, too, are in the tapestry of this work.  Anger at losing them is part of the work, as is deep unutterable sadness but the overriding sense (I hope) is of joy, typified by the uplifting Agnus Dei which concludes the work.  The 'Requiem' uses parts of the Latin mass interspersed with poetry by Emily Bronte, Walt Whitman, William Drummond, Kahlil Gibran and myself.  It is scored for soprano, tenor, choir and small chamber ensemble.  The instrumental ensemble provides the rhythmic and harmonic structure of the work but the main focus is the vocal material, the emotional crux of which is the Whitman setting  concluding the Recordare. The 'Requiem' combines plainsong motifs with dance elements, atonalism with minimalism and extended vocalising to present the requiem in a unique way - the ritual is still there but so is my personal comment on it. The requiem was written for the Jubilate Singers and their conductor John Pattinson and was premiered by them on 31st August 2001 in Christ Church Cathedral, Christchurch, New Zealand."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Historical background  I got to know Euan Murdoch both as a friend and as a musician when he came to Dunedin to teach cello at the University some years ago.  Everything about Euan encouraged me to write him a piece: his lively and warm personality, his huge enthusiasm for music and his brilliance as a player, plus a certain down-to-earth Kiwi quality that is refreshing to encounter within classical music circles.  Having composed 'The Blue Sonata' for him in 1999, I was approached by Euan to write something else.  He had moved to Wellington for a job at Victoria University, and wanted a piece for Trio Victoria.  I relished this opportunity to compose again for Euan, and for the others in the group, Doug Beilman and Thomas Hecht.   During 2000 I came to the conclusion I needed a substantial break from composing, due to what might be termed creative 'burn out'.  I also wanted the time to reassess the direction I was heading with my music.  Consequently, the trio commission arrived at a time where I felt the urge to experiment and come up with something a little different.  Having said that, there are connecting threads with earlier pieces, particularly my Symphony No.2 which was premiered at the Wellington Arts Festival in 2000.   Piano Trio was commissioned by Chamber Music New Zealand, with funding provided by Creative New Zealand.   The Music  This Piano Trio attempts to suggest psychological states through sound images.  It is not directly programmatic but, as the titles of the movements suggest, there are distinct ideas and moods imbedded in the music.  The first movement uses imaginary characters from childhood - 'Maggie Boy' and 'Nice Boy' - as representations of two sides of personality: the bad and the good, or the dark and the light.  'Maggie Boy' has music that is barbarous, angular and dissonant.  In the opening section a 12-note theme appears, providing the basis for much of the material that follows.   Following a metric modulation (or change in note values) the violin and cello play a wispy, lyrical theme that portrays 'Nice Boy', while the pianist's right hand tinkers away with 12-note themes, impervious to the sentiments of the strings.  'Maggie Boy' returns in the final section of the movement, dispatching 'Nice Boy' to the recesses of the mind.   The second movement, 'The Deamon', is concerned with neither good nor bad but rather the nothingness of depression, that caged state of mind where emotions and feelings seem to spiral inwards.  Melodic lines twist and turn, trying to find a way out of the psychological cage.  Reference is made to the 12-note theme from the first movement, as well as the 'life and death' theme from my Symphony No.2.   The third movement, 'Hyper-dyper' is, as its title suggests, ebullient and almost frantically busy. An angular and jazzy opening theme is followed by a nervous, darting second theme featuring some special effects on the strings. The piano rudely interrupts proceedings and a playful but tense middle section follows, based on the 12-note theme from the first movement. In the Coda the 'hyper' quality dominates and the Trio comes to an end on a crunching discord. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In contrast to the singular, organic process of solo for cello this piece plays with the idea of juxtaposing contrasting fragments of material. It was stimulated by a book of dream symbols, in the form of simple gouache paintings, originating in the Rajasthan Gujarat area of Western India in the early 19th century.  The book is one of any number of dream lexicons to be found in ancient eastern cultures that guided the interpretation of dreams using mythological and cultural symbols pertaining to fortune and destiny. Although the Rajasthan Gujarat lexicon informs aspects of the aesthetic of the piece, it is not intended that the music function as an illustration of the visual images themselves.  Rather: whereas the pictures seek to make concrete the ephemeral matter of the dream, the music embodies an attempt both to restore the subjective nature of the dreamscape and to reconstruct the grammar of its articulation in time - concentrated, disjunct and fleeting. This occurs perhaps in the way that one might attempt to reconstruct a paragraph in an archaic language from its written symbols, without having access to their original source or context, guided only by intuitions based on experience of one's own language - in this case the 'language' of the dream. The title of the piece is borrowed from one of the images of the Rajasthan Gujarat lexicon. Water Mountain was composed for Apartment House 1999. It has been performed in Reading, New Zealand (175E ensemble 2002), Seoul (ACL festival 2003) and Brighton (Soundwaves festival, 2007) and broadcast by Radio NZ."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Inner' extends out of the sound and sensation of human breath � from a visceral and magnified perspective. The starting point was concentrated listening to some straightforward electroacoustic transformations of breath sound. Because the spectrum of the sound is rich and noisy, as well as capable of being articulated with seemingly infinite variety, it felt almost as though a whole world of new sound identities might be heard 'within' a single breath sound itself. So following that idea I tried to draw attention to the way vowel-like colourations and the rhythmic contours of the breath can be developed and related across a range of noise-based gestures and textures. In seeking to anchor the sound transformations against recognisable sound, the gesture of the opening intake of breath became a key figure, hinting at a surface of realism during some of the more abstract extensions of the material. But perhaps one of the most important motivations for me as composer was the innate potential of the electroacoustic medium to exaggerate the apparent physical scale and presence of such a very intimate and personal sound. Along with 'Virtual', and 'Time, Motion and Memory', this work forms an integrated sequence of three electroacoustic works exploring movement between sound sources which are 'internal' and 'external' to human sensibility. 'Inner' was realised in the Electroacoustic Music Studios of Victoria University of Wellington and premiered at Concordia University, Montr�al in February 1996. The work was awarded first prize in the 1996 Stockholm Electronic Arts Award."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Virtual' attempts to convey the idea of an illusory soundscape set in vibrant motion by the wind�an invisible and capricious source of energy for the �virtual� objects in the space, the exact nature of which we are left to imagine. This idea extended partly out of my fascination with the process of making field recordings in the natural environment, where the wind is typically regarded as a pervasive and problematic intruder. But, in fact, the wind is often a part of the sonic signature of a place (especially in the notoriously windy city I was living in when I composed this piece). So I set out to record wind �noise� trying to take advantage of the very active stereo play it produces across a pair of microphones (just as it does across our ear canals). Other sound identities were designed around this idea, mostly derived from turbulent air streams and tube resonances. I also attempted to give some of these complex sound shapes something of the spectral colouration of the human breathing, in an attempt to set up a sense of inanimate sounds taking on more animate behaviour. Linked to this are some characteristic patterns of spatial morphology within which these sounds evolve and transform. 'Virtual' was realised in the Electroacoustic Music Studios of Victoria University of Wellington and premiered there on April 24th 1997. The work was awarded an honorary mention in the 1997 Prix Ars Electronica, Special Mention in the 1997 Prix Noroit-L�once Petitot and pre-selected in the 1997 Bourges International Competition for electroacoustic music."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: A swing was one of my favourite childhood playthings. Its gentle motion and plaintive sound opened for me a very intimate world of contemplation, fantasy and imagination. This piece could be thought of as a sonic environment in which transformations of the swing's sound trigger dream-like associations and surrealistic juxtapositions of sound-images�where the co-existence of many sonic references might mirror the imagination�s freedom to form unusual and tenuously sketched connections. While the swing remains relatively �fixed� in space, other environmentally based sounds cut across its presence, and the swing itself is gradually transformed towards the sound image of a giant pendulum. 'Time, Motion and Memory' was realised in the Electroacoustic Music Studios of Victoria University of Wellington and premiered there on February 26th 1998."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work is an exploration of the sound-image of rain. In many ways, I felt the process of composing this piece to be one of revealing and expanding the myriad patterns and colours within the sound, normally noticeable only with very concentrated listening. Since I work exclusively with my own environmental recordings, I tend to see the compositional process as opening out of the richness of the act of listening itself, supported by the imaginative associations for which it can be a catalyst. Like many environmental sources, the sound of rain is extremely varied and, at least in theory, covers a whole range of morphologies from the individual droplet to saturated granular noise. In collecting source material I made numerous field recordings in different locations focusing on the sound of rain falling on different objects�such as leaves, windows and puddles�since it was clear that the variety of sound colours inherent in rain is largely defined by the nature of the surface it falls upon. In processing these sounds, I tried to think about these distinctions: the �granular� aspect tending towards long-term development of texture, and the �droplets� providing models for attack-resonance structures. But in continuing with this idea, my approach was not always subtle! In the studio I tried to expand the gestural rhythm by superimposing the dramatic amplitude envelopes of fireworks onto the dense textures of heavy rain. And, with the use of multiple grouped resonators, I was able to impose defined pitch structures onto the material, allowing slowly evolving inharmonic spectra to eventually have a central role in the piece. As a whole, Liquid Sky aims to convey the feeling of a larger-than-life immersion in rain, and an intensified view of a powerful environmental phenomenon. 'Liquid Sky' was realised in the studios of the Groupe de recherches musicales, Paris and EMS Stockholm. Collection of sound sources and some initial processing was done at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver. The work was commissioned by the Ina-GRM and premiered in the GRM's Multiphonies series, Salle Olivier Messiaen, Maison de Radio France, Paris, March 20th 2000. It was pre-selected in the 2000 Bourges International Competition for electroacoustic music."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work was composed on the 8-channel digital sound system at EMS Stockholm while I was a visiting composer there in 1998. The piece grew out of my encounters with the Stockholm soundscape, which surprised me with its clarity and vitality�both above and below the ground � the chimes of church clocks audible across very large distances � the tunnelbana (subway) with its caverns hewn out of granite, where even quiet shuffles of feet are etched with clarity � skaters on the open air ice rink � footsteps on granite stairs and creaking floors. Along with these I integrated a number of field recordings made in my own country � a fairground, with ghost train and house of mirrors � wind gently resonating a flagpole � I found many of these sounds so captivating that I realised I was carrying impressions of them in my head, and frequently imagining the presence of one sound �inside� another as I was hearing them (both in and out of the studio). 'Allting Runt Omkring' attempts to project some of that sensation by creating a new context in which field recordings from the natural world are integrated and transformed. All sound sources in the work are environmental in origin. I work exclusively with my own field recordings, since for me it is important to have a connection with the original context of my sound sources. In this piece the context in which sounds are heard and shaped was an important stimulus, while the tape medium allows me to forge new contextual relationships for the sound. For example, in Stockholm there are a large number of churches and public buildings in the main city area, especially Gamla Stan (the old town), but also across to the islands of Kungsholmen and S�der. At quarter hour intervals the clocks of Stockholm chime, and from a single vantage point one can hear an astonishing depth in the soundscape. The Stockholm tunnelbana also has a great acoustical presence and range of sounds, and in this piece I have tried to fuse sounds of �above� and �below� ground (for instance by linking the bell resonances to the tunnelbana, or by taking the noise of trains to the ice rink)."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Sju' is based on the variable pronunciation of this Swedish word. There are two very distinct pronunciations of �sju��one strictly �correct�, another more �colloquial��but also a few shades in between. These distinctions provided me with interesting material, since the difference is mainly one of the initial brief noise component of the word�and even then, the articulations of different people generated a large range of subtly varied noise contours. In shaping the piece I used as a basic model the transition of this noise into pitch (the vowel component), especially the idea of pitched resonances forming a relatively static underpinning of texture, but prone to drift towards new sound shapes. While visiting Sweden in 1998, two of the people I worked with enjoyed using �sju� as a kind of light-hearted Swedish competency test for anglophones�since there is no real equivalent sound in English. My indifferent performance in that test, and my fascination with the bewitching nature of the sounds led me to try and capture and play with them! Dedicated to everyone at EMS Stockholm, with special thanks to Inger, G�ran, Paulina and her class, Perikles and Fivos. 'Sju' was composed in the Electroacoustic music Studios, Victoria University of Wellington and premiered by BEAST, Birmingham, 4 February 2000. It was selected for the finals of the ARTS XXI competition, Valencia, Spain."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In the tradition of the Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, Hine Raukatauri is the goddess of music and dance. She is embodied in the form of the female case-moth, who hangs in the bushes and sings in a pure, high voice to attract the male moths to her.  Her hair is found as a fern, the hanging spleenwort, and her voice is heard in the sound of the putorino, an instrument known only in Aotearoa (the Maori name for New Zealand). The putorino is an instrument that can be played in various ways � as a flute, as a trumpet and as a means of enhancing or altering the human voice. 'Hine Raukatauri' is written for two performers, one playing conventional flutes (piccolo, C and alto flutes), and the other for taonga puoro (instruments). The score features three different putorino, which, like all taonga puoro, (and also the songs and chants) have a small pitch range, rarely exceeding a fourth, which varies from instrument to instrument. Three putorino are used in this piece � one made of albatross bone and two of wood, and both the flute and trumpet voices are used. Other instruments used are a karanga manu (bird-caller), a purerehua (swung bull-roarer) and tumutumu (tapped instruments.)  The flute player�s part is notated, but the music for the taonga puoro is improvised; there are areas when the flute player is encouraged to improvise with the taonga."

In 1984, when in Java, I had attended a traditional-style wedding ceremony. At the start, the marriage couple were led into the venue by a dancer accompanied by the gamelan who were already installed there.

The dancer�s style was extremely graceful & refined, with many slowly moving expressive gestures of the arms and hands. When directly in front of the Gamelan the dancer turned toward the musicians for a few seconds, and instantly his style of dance changed into something quite different. Frenetically indulging in all the off-beats, he was grooving along with it. Everybody loved this brief and direct acknowledgment to the musicians, and didn�t hesitate to show their enthusiasm. The dancer then returned to the previous style and carried on with the procession moving away from the Gamelan. I remained fascinated by this particular concept of a multi-levelled music and wanted to reflect the idea in the dancer without emulating specific Gamelan techniques.

It is like a wave bearing thought towards utterance. [�and�11] was composed for, and is dedicated to, Chachi and Lontano."

Observing him grow and develop in the last 6 months has rekindled the vague memories and nebulous feelings from my own early life, and has prompted me to wonder what memories, feelings, sights and smells etc he will remember in years to come.   I am sure that these musings are not new and have occurred millions of times for many millennia, but I have still found them rather special.  Perhaps the slower parts of the piece portray a nostalgic and retrospective perspective, and perhaps the faster gestures depict some animated conversations as heard by a newborn."

  general_note: "Rimmer: Europa; CD"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: In composing this concerto I recognise two contrasting musical cultures within the European artistic tradition. The Brass Band represents what I call a 'closed' musical system portrayed by its standardised instrumentation heard to great effect in its stirring marches, sonorous hymn playing, contest pieces and arrangements of popular and show music,  while the orchestra  with its dazzling array of many instrumental colours, its flexible instrumentation and its potential for pushing musical boundaries, represents an 'open' musical system.   I wanted also to exploit the virtuosic capacity of the brass band as a concerto soloist and to celebrate through this work the unity and solidarity amongst brass musicians. 'Europa' is a one movement work in five main sections which alternate slow atmospheric music with a fast and rhythmic style. The latter is heard in the many rapid passages which switch from band to orchestra and vice versa. Noteable also is the relationship between the band and the orchesta particularly in the cadenzas for the brass band followed by the orchestral brass. I was spurred into composing this work after reading about Europa, one of the large moons of the planet Jupiter first seen by Galileo in 1610 and named after a goddess of Greek mythology. Such thoughts were instrumental in generating my first musical ideas, for instance the name 'Europa' is represented by a six note melody heard throughout the work. However, my initial thoughts about Europa receeded as I explored and developed the musical material. 'Europa'  was commissioned by the Auckland Philharmonia. The work was first performed by the Dalewool Auckland Brass and the Auckland Philharmonia conducted by Miguel Harth-Bedoya on 13 June 2002 in the Auckland Town Hall. "

The work was premiered at the Nelson Composers' Workshop in 2002 and has received subsequent performances at the 2003 ACL Forum in Seoul, Korea, and at the neue musik aus neuseeland festival at the Musikhochschule L�beck in 2006.  Dylan Lardelli has played the guitar part in all performances. '...vers libre...' is published by Waiteata Press and appears on a CD of works by emerging New Zealand composers."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: While making this piece, I was enthralled by my daughter�s experimentation with language, at the age of nineteen months. Recognisable English words were freely mingled with streams of idiosyncratic verbal utterance, and while meaning was often obscure to adult ears, patterns of words and sounds were repeated in a way that was clearly linguistic. The title of the piece is one of these patterns, which she used frequently, and which I am still unable to translate. To me, such playfulness suggests musical processes. Almost from birth, the toys which most held her attention were those which made sounds. In response to this, I had recorded a collection of the toys which had most fascinated her around the age of seven months. Nearly a year later, the sounds finally accumulated into a musical shape. I can only dream of recapturing for myself the inventiveness of a young child, but the observation of the child�s manipulation of sound and meaning leaves its traces in my work."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Down in the Brunner Mine was commissioned by The Onslow Brass Band in Wellington and first performed and broadcast in 1996.  It is a short set of variations based on a New Zealand folk song called 'Down in the Brunner Mine'.  The folk song describes the coal mine on the West Coast, near Greymouth, and tells of the disaster that occured there in the 1890s when about 60 men were killed in a mine collapse.  Here is the first stanza:   We worked in the heat and the thick black dust,  Sticks to your skin like a burnt pie crust,  We rue each day the miner must  Go down in the Brunner Mine.   The folksong tune is announced by the cornets at the beginning, playing in their low register, accompanied by heavy chords in the low brass.  Variation 1 features a horn solo, and the cornets return for Variation 2, playing in fourths.  Variations 3 and 4 are strident in character and feature short flourishes.  The snare drum enters at the start of Variation 5 and the cornets play a punchy idea using repeated notes.   This idea returns in contrapuntal form in Variation 7, while the 6th variation inbetween features little fragments of the theme on various instruments.  Variation 8 is powerful and buffeting, and uses the theme in canon.  Variations 9-11 make use of the theme's arpeggio outline and the music builds to a climax.   Following this, the music gradually winds down in Variation 12, with the theme appearing in inversion against a repeated bass pattern. After a reflective silence, the short chorale-like coda rounds off the work, and is marked \"in memoriam\". "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work another commissioned work, this time by the Kaipara District Council, in honour of long time accordion and arts supporter and lifetime member of the New Zealand Accordion Association, the late Mrs. Jenny Cocurullo.  A respected and loved citizen of Dargaville, the main town in the Kaipara region in the north of New Zealand, Jenny always promoted the Kaipara as the 'Gem of the North'.  She in turn was considered 'The Gem of the Kaipara'.   Written for solo accordion with string orchestra and percussion, the Gem of the Kaipara was premiered in Dargaville on 11 May 2002, where it was performed by the Auckland Symphony with New Zealand accordion soloist Kevin Friedrich, and conducted by the composer.  Written in simple sonata form, the introduction of the piece is quite mysterious in nature, with the lower strings providing a subtle bagpipe-like drone.  The airy melody and soft percussive effects are reminiscent of the awakening of the lush majestic Kauri tree forests and countryside of the Kaipara Flats with its blanketing dawn fog.  The main themes are written around Jenny's name and the name of the region  'Kaipara'. The lyrical re-occurring melody is first heard by the accordion with string accompaniment and then switches to the string accompanied by the accordion.    After working through an animated and rhythmical jig-like section portraying Jenny's boundless energy, various interests and Scottish heritage, the strings restate the soaring melody expressing the vast expansiveness and sweeping landscapes of the Kaipara region."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: As its title suggests, this piece is about a constant wavering in purpose and intention, where ideas vie for a foothold in an ever shifting aural vista. Crudity wrestles with elegance, liquid horizontalism explodes out of and is then impeded by block verticalism, grand string-centred explorations are effaced and undermined by lightly scored, fragmentary material, seemingly stable colour palates are suddenly infiltrated by waves or blobs of contrasting timbres...  I was very interested in exploring in some small way the huge array of sub-groupings of instruments within the orchestra, and I sought to elevate these chamber groupings to the same level of importance as the entire body of resources used simultaneously. The most obvious example of this is the frequent use of the string quartet (ie, the lead players of each string section, minus the basses) as both a timbral paring-back of the strings as a whole and a sovereign expressive force in its own right. In considering the orchestra in part as a large chamber group, many individual lines assume, in isolated areas, concerto-like duties and characteristics, where their solo outbursts are supported by burbling, decorational accompaniments. Only towards the end does a single rhythmic idea (a simple driving moto perpetuo) sustain a platform around which previously antagonistic colouristic and textural devices are able to mingle happily before a final decay of order and a brief, evaporating coda. �Vacillations� was premiered in Perth by the West Australian Symphony Orchestra, conductor Kevin Field, as part of the Australian Composers' Orchestral Forum, 2002."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Historical background  I got to know Euan Murdoch both as a friend and as a musician when he came to Dunedin to teach cello at the University some years ago.  Everything about Euan encouraged me to write him a piece: his lively and warm personality, his huge enthusiasm for music and his brilliance as a player, plus a certain down-to-earth Kiwi quality that is refreshing to encounter within classical music circles.  Having composed 'The Blue Sonata' for him in 1999, I was approached by Euan to write something else.  He had moved to Wellington for a job at Victoria University, and wanted a piece for Trio Victoria.  I relished this opportunity to compose again for Euan, and for the others in the group, Doug Beilman and Thomas Hecht.   During 2000 I came to the conclusion I needed a substantial break from composing, due to what might be termed creative 'burn out'.  I also wanted the time to reassess the direction I was heading with my music.  Consequently, the trio commission arrived at a time where I felt the urge to experiment and come up with something a little different.  Having said that, there are connecting threads with earlier pieces, particularly my Symphony No.2 which was premiered at the Wellington Arts Festival in 2000.   Piano Trio was commissioned by Chamber Music New Zealand, with funding provided by Creative New Zealand.   The Music  This Piano Trio attempts to suggest psychological states through sound images.  It is not directly programmatic but, as the titles of the movements suggest, there are distinct ideas and moods imbedded in the music.  The first movement uses imaginary characters from childhood - 'Maggie Boy' and 'Nice Boy' - as representations of two sides of personality: the bad and the good, or the dark and the light.  'Maggie Boy' has music that is barbarous, angular and dissonant.  In the opening section a 12-note theme appears, providing the basis for much of the material that follows.   Following a metric modulation (or change in note values) the violin and cello play a wispy, lyrical theme that portrays 'Nice Boy', while the pianist's right hand tinkers away with 12-note themes, impervious to the sentiments of the strings.  'Maggie Boy' returns in the final section of the movement, dispatching 'Nice Boy' to the recesses of the mind.   The second movement, 'The Deamon', is concerned with neither good nor bad but rather the nothingness of depression, that caged state of mind where emotions and feelings seem to spiral inwards.  Melodic lines twist and turn, trying to find a way out of the psychological cage.  Reference is made to the 12-note theme from the first movement, as well as the 'life and death' theme from my Symphony No.2.   The third movement, 'Hyper-dyper' is, as its title suggests, ebullient and almost frantically busy. An angular and jazzy opening theme is followed by a nervous, darting second theme featuring some special effects on the strings. The piano rudely interrupts proceedings and a playful but tense middle section follows, based on the 12-note theme from the first movement. In the Coda the 'hyper' quality dominates and the Trio comes to an end on a crunching discord. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In his 1974 collection 'The lives of a Cell', Lewis Thomas wrote a memorable essay devoted to the spectrum of sound made by all living creatures. He believes that as well as producing sounds in every possible way to send messages to their own kind, all creatures have the urge to make some kind of music. The rhythmic sounds         emitted by all creatures might, Lewis suggests �be the recapitulation of something else - an earliest memory, a score for the transformation of inanimate random matter in chaos into the improbable ordered dance of living forms.� It was this essay, together with my fascination in the rediscovery of the part of Auckland I knew as a young child, that have shaped this piece. The basis of the piece is the twelve possible three-note groups which function to form molecular structures - harmonic, textural, gestural, melodic - some simple, some complex, often symmetrical.  The piece could be regarded as part of a classical tradition, in that it focuses primarily on balance of pitch and orchestration rather than on gesture or programmatic elements, and places the instrumental writing well within the range of the instruments rather than exploiting their extremes.  'The improbable ordered dance ----' is in a single movement and begins with a ghostly chant-like melody over a drone; this recurs in different forms several times during the piece. A transition section based on transformed sounds of nocturnal birds leads to a metrically free 'dawn chorus'. The following chorale-like passages and the rapid sections that follow are part of a restless upward-moving continuum which can never settle nor ever finish. The later sections of the piece recycle, combine and finally dissipate the earlier material."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Bright Silence', for solo violin, is an evocation of Central Otago, the high plateau between the Southern Alps and the coastal plains in the South Island of New Zealand. The area is treeless, rocky, sparsely populated, and the piece reflects the sounds, silences and ghosts of the area.  'Bright Silence' was written while Gillian Whitehead was composer-in-residence with the Auckland Philharmonia, as the competition piece for the inaugural Michael Hill World Violin Competition, held at Queenstown, New Zealand, where it received its first eighteen performances in June 2001. The piece is dedicated to Michael Hill."

The work starts with atmosphere - waves lapping very gently on Petone beach and the tinkle of sand . The main theme sounds on the Fr. Horn then the music builds and eventually a reference is made to the old whaling days followed by a storm (a characteristic of Cook Strait - the infamous 'Southerly') building to hurricane force strength. The storm also alludes to the sinking of the Waihini in the '60s. An elegy for strings follows in honour of the victims of that disaster. The mood gradually changes to calm acceptance and on to an optimistic view of Wellington's future, a big, full tutti . The work closes with the atmosphere of sand, surf and evening. "

Within the tone-poem is an evocation of sunset on the prairies, a hoedown and a magnificent climax representing the Rocky Mountains and reflecting the optimism that should continue to be Canada's birthright.

Just as Schoenberg opened a door for classical music with his Second String Quartet, Jamaican dub started the sampling and scratching scene which grooved all the way to 90's Bristol. Clive Randy Chin's \"Easy Come Dub\" is a stripped down remix of The Wailers' \"It Won't Come Easy\". In \"Only You\" from 1997, the Bristol-based band Portishead create an ambient space in which even the \"Inspector Clouseau\" theme finds a new identity. Compressing time and space, 'Secret Arnold' finds room for all three � Schoenberg, Randy and Portishead. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The first movement opens quietly with a number of ideas in which the melodic interval of a fifth has some prominence. A faster section follows and the development of these ideas leads to climaxes with patterns of diverse rhythms superimposed.  After the final climax the movement subsides to a quiet ending. The second movement has the character of a Scherzo. Lively  rhythms alternating between 6/8 and 3/4 lead to a quieter sustained \"trio\" tune. The scherzo resumes and takes the music to a climax where these two ideas are presented together - the faster one (violins and trumpets) across the slower (horns and trombones). The music unwinds until we are left with a fragment of the slower theme, which becomes a link to the third movement. The finale has the form of a free passacaglia. It grows out of the opening trumpet tune and its accompaniment - the trumpet tune becomes the passacaglia bass, while the stepwise bass takes over as melody. At the end of the movement a reference back to the melodic falling fifths of the first movement leads to the final chord - fading from brass to wind, and in the end, to strings alone.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The three movements of the symphony are:  I - 'Stratagem of Trumpets'  III - 'Mi-1st'  IIII - 'Double Helix'    \"Turning and turning in the widening gyre  The falcon cannot hear the falconer;  Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  Mere anarchy is loosed on the world . . .\"   from \"The Second Coming\" by W. B. Yeats   When asked to compose a work on the meaning and symbolism of the new Millenium I decided to use William Butler Yeats' famous poem \"The Second Coming\" as a starting point.  Written in 1921, when the old order in Europe was breaking down, it suggests a revolution or rotation in history (the gyre) will bring about a 'second coming' of an important historical figure, and the dawn of a new Millenium.  Yeats' vision of the new world order to come is not, however, optimistic.  He sees the coming of a 'rough beast' with a 'lion body and the head of a man', a cold and heartless creature that might be equated with certain infamous and autocratic leaders in the 20th century.   The 'gyre' or revolution is represented in the symphony by a rolling, sliding timpani sound, accompanied by bass drum and tam tam at the start of the work.  This idea becomes an important motif and appears at the very start.  Following the 'gyre', we hear a 'life and death' theme that begins like a cradle song (the birth of Christ), rises, and then twists downwards in a chromatic line.  This theme provides most of the material for what follows.   The slow introduction climaxes with hammer blows, a reference to the death of Christ. From this a trumpet call emerges, becoming a significant motif later in the movement.   In the allegro that follows, the 'life and death' theme is transformed into a fast and restless melody, beginning as pizzicato on the strings.  Complimenting this is a macabre and folky theme on muted trumpet and clarinets, evoking a sort of frenzied, gyrating dance.  The music quietens and a lyrical theme appears on flute, accompanied by timpani and harp and developed by the strings.  As the music climaxes again, the trumpet call reappears, shared around other brass instruments.  The significance of this trumpet call can be seen with reference to another poem, this time by New Zealander Peggy Dunstan:   Stratagem of Trumpets   \"Then the trumpets sounded  Not in a flare of pomp and pageantry  But with a golden lilting laughter  That seemed to open up the sky  So that the music dropped like rain  Upon the upturned faces  And the enchanted ears were closed  To everything except those throbbing notes. . . \"   The trumpets distract the listeners, and make them unaware of the advancing enemy.  Dunstan's poem goes on to describe a massacre of Serbs in 1389 at the time of the battle of Kosovo between Serbs and Turks.  At the time of composing my symphony Kosovo was once again in the grip of war and atrocity, only this time the Serbs were the aggressors and Albanians were the victims.  It seems to me that Kosovo sums up a situation common in our past Millenium: an endless cycle of struggle for land and power, costing many innocent lives.   In the music, the log drum heralds a sort of 'musical battle-field' in which the 'life and death' theme becomes an aggressive, jagged idea, used fugally in an increasingly dissonant texture.  Following the 'battle', solo strings, piccolo and harp provide a brief lament for the dead and the music returns to the music of the Introduction.  This time it is mixed fragments of the flute theme, and the movement ends quietly with the 'gyre' motif.   If the first movement represents the past, then the second movement is a comment on the present.  The title 'Mi-1st' refers to the heavy emphasis on the note E (or Mi in the sol-fa system) as a central pitch, but can also be interpreted as 'me-first'.  Essentially this music is about the natural human tendency to be self-centred, which I believe has become much more prevalent in our own society.  It is perhaps one aspect of Yeats' 'rough beast' that hinders our progress.   There are three main ideas in this presto movement.  The first is a savage chromatic theme that encircles the note E, played initially on strings. It is immediately followed by a vigorous, syncopated theme on strings and winds.  As a contrast, the harp accompanies a quieter, smoother theme on the violins, which also includes the twisting, chromatic motif from the first movement.  In the middle, the music becomes increasingly chaotic until a climax on C is reached, with hope for resolution to the discords.  However, the music slips into the key of B, and the strings play a restless, anxious version of the contrast theme.  The frenetic energy of the first part gradually dissipates, and the movement collapses into a web of solo violins.  The 'gyre' motif has the final say.   There are a number of themes in the third movement, but all evolve in some way or other from the constantly twisting, turning melodic line that appears at the start.  Used in close canon, this melody represents the intertwining DNA molecule, and hence the title of the movement, 'Double Helix'.  Discovered recently in our history, genetics are sure to have a highly significant role in the future.  This music looks forward with the hope that genetics will be used in a positive way.  It also acknowledges that we carry with us the characteristics of previous generations (covering a whole Millenium and more!), and that the future will be significantly shaped by these characteristics. At the same time we need to learn from the hard lessons of previous generations in order to make progress.  Consequently, the symphony has an optimistic and celebratory end, which is tempered by a sense of warning.  In the coda, the threads of 'Double Helix' motifs are combined with a return of the main theme from the first movement, played on full brass.   Dedicated to Sandy  "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: During the composition of 'Pivotal Orbits', I was influenced by the sensual imagery of the following passage in Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer:  The earth is not an arid plateau of health and comfort, but a great sprawling female with velvet torso that swells and heaves with ocean billows; she squirms beneath a diadem of sweat and anguish. Naked and sexed she rolls among the clouds in the violet light of the stars. All of her�blazes with furious ardour. She moves amongst the seasons and the years with a grand whoopla that seizes the torso with paroxysmal fury, that shakes the cobwebs out of the sky; she subsides on her pivotal orbits with volcanic tremors.  'Pivotal Orbits' is a portrayal of this tectonic restlessness and movement, existing in a lush sound environment, tied together by three recurring ideas that are in constant developmental flux. 'Pivotal Orbits' was premiered by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra (conductor Kazufumi Yamashita) at the Asian Music Festival, Tokyo, September 2003.  It has since been played in a SOUNZ/NZSO Readings, conductor Hamish McKeich."

While on the 'ice', I recorded several sounds, many of which are included in this piece. The work is an attempt to create an expressive work of sonic art that reflects my personal interpretation of the environment of Antarctica and my experiences there.  The Antarctic sounds incorporated into the work are (in order) the sounds of Walking on Snow, Suas, Polar Wind, Radio Communications, Weddell Seals, an Adelie Penguin Rookery and Antarctic White Out. My Antarctic experience is one of the most significant and important experiences of my life.  The various moods, expansive grandeur and majestic ice-scapes of Antarctica have left a deep and enduring impression. With thanks to Antarctic New Zealand, Creative New Zealand and Dr. Joe Waas (University of Waikato) whose recordings of the Weddell Seals augmented my own."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: \"The boundary between collection and fetishism is mediated by classification and display in tension with accumulation and secrecy.\"  Two musical strands run virtually throughout this short piece, sometimes clearly differentiated, at other times more obscure and confused, but always at some level presenting an opposition between an 'organic', accretional layer and an 'inorganic' abruptly changing one. This opposition can operate not only at surface level - as it does at the beginning, when two highly differentiated instrumental combinations are presented, each with their own characteristic modes of behaviour - but also at a subcutaneous level, when applied to various ways of generating or modifying the basic material.  These concerns form only the technical armature and implementation of the piece, of course, and much of the original musical imagery was suggested by Borges' short story The Circular Ruins. While giving the obligatory (questionable?) disclaimer about the piece in no way being programmatic, much of the mood and atmosphere of the story was certainly in my mind during the initial sketching stages, and it seems to me that its central conceit - one human dreaming another into existence, by sheer will - is a marvellous metaphor for the act of composition."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: For a long time I've been rather envious of painters such as Francis Bacon, who regularly produced long series of satellite \"studies\" around one subject. While these works are complete and interesting in their own right, they also function as commentaries and footnotes on each other, and on the cluster of preoccupations they share, as much as on the paintings for which they are nominally studies. Composers do this sort of thing less often, but it was with this idea of a study in mind that I set out to write a small \"clarinet concerto\" for Gretchen Dunsmore and 175 East. While 'a study for voicing doubts' is a complete composition in its own right it's also a testing ground for ideas which may well be developed and extended when I get around to writing a larger-scale piece for clarinet and ensemble. This will of course be called 'Not a study for voicing doubts'. "

Although the words arrived late in the process, they go some way towards describing the forces at work. Propelled by small-scale rhythmic articulation, strands reach out towards points, tracing delicate spirals through space. Alongside these sit diffuse clouds of material, out of which new constellations take shape. There is above all a concern with the intimate connection between the gestures of performance and their sonic result. The instruments act as filters which shape raw sound in a manner reminiscent of the procedures of the electroacoustic studio. There is a constant tension between organic direction and quite arbitrary frameworks, a mesh of non-congruent processes operating on different structural levels. In front of this, the intricate detail of the audible surface attempts to impose perceptual order on the precariously balanced network of forces."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In contrast to the singular, organic process of solo for cello this piece plays with the idea of juxtaposing contrasting fragments of material. It was stimulated by a book of dream symbols, in the form of simple gouache paintings, originating in the Rajasthan Gujarat area of Western India in the early 19th century.  The book is one of any number of dream lexicons to be found in ancient eastern cultures that guided the interpretation of dreams using mythological and cultural symbols pertaining to fortune and destiny. Although the Rajasthan Gujarat lexicon informs aspects of the aesthetic of the piece, it is not intended that the music function as an illustration of the visual images themselves.  Rather: whereas the pictures seek to make concrete the ephemeral matter of the dream, the music embodies an attempt both to restore the subjective nature of the dreamscape and to reconstruct the grammar of its articulation in time - concentrated, disjunct and fleeting. This occurs perhaps in the way that one might attempt to reconstruct a paragraph in an archaic language from its written symbols, without having access to their original source or context, guided only by intuitions based on experience of one's own language - in this case the 'language' of the dream. The title of the piece is borrowed from one of the images of the Rajasthan Gujarat lexicon. Water Mountain was composed for Apartment House 1999. It has been performed in Reading, New Zealand (175E ensemble 2002), Seoul (ACL festival 2003) and Brighton (Soundwaves festival, 2007) and broadcast by Radio NZ."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This cycle was written at the request of Dunedin soprano Judy Bellingham. It represents my first extended writing for solo voice and piano, something which is perhaps surprising given my substantial choral output. Ursula Bethell (1874-1945) was born in England, grew up in New Zealand, then spent most of her early adult life in England and Europe. In the 1920�s she returned to live in Christchurch, establishing a garden and becoming a focus for the city�s literary life. She began to write poetry from the age of fifty. It has been suggested that her poetry was influenced by Whitman and Hopkins, and she has been called �the truest colonial voice New Zealand possesses�. I am grateful to my colleague at Epsom Girls Grammar School, Dr Dot Neutze, for offering the following interpretive comments on the cycle: I�m sure (the cycle) comes from Bethell�s looking westward from her �limen amabile� on the Port Hills, and watching the sun set over the Southern Alps. Section I describes the physical scene at sunset, rather grandly as she is leading up to God (�Light of Lights�). She watches the last light of day give way to �all-encompassing dark�. In Section II the lights of mankind (Christchurch and the settlements of the Canterbury Plains) provide �choirs of golden lights�, but they are only �sparks� in the �deepening dark...deepening night�. In Section III, as it gets darker, the �antiphonal stars� take up the song, extending the music to the lights of the whole universe: �imperial orbs...moons...planets of magnitude...suns to suns reply...serene to serene stars�. In Section IV heavenly beings take up the mortal Christians� evening hymns �at the time of lamp-lighting�. While �pastoral ministers sleep� the �bright clair-audient angels� continue the praises of the �Master of Music�. The hymn of praise in Section V deals with the deepest Christian mysteries, the paradox of the Creator who became mortal: �Almighty Artificer...human heart�. It�s the light shining in darkness �put out for a night� in crucifixion and �rising mightily� to become the light of the Holy City. At the climax of the hymn �our lights� are consumed in the light of heaven. After the power of this universal hymn of praise the sequence needs the simplicity of word (and rhyme) in Section VI to bring the poem back to the reality of the physical scene: �hidden seas and river...the silent night�, and the darkness of the plains. In Bethell�s poem it shows a reluctance to let go of the vision, a sadness that we are only human. The words seem to tumble over each other, almost in anticlimax, as a very quick winding down. Musically the cycle develops from the opening piano gesture. It provides a starting point for much of the melodic and harmonic material. Each section of the cycle begins at the point at which the previous section concluded by picking up on some musical element from its concluding bars. Sections II and VI are most closely linked musically with material from the earlier part reappearing in an altered guise in the later part."

While these works are complete and interesting in their own right, they also function as commentaries and footnotes on each other, and on the cluster of preoccupations they share, as much as on the paintings for which they are nominally studies. Composers do this sort of thing less often, but it was with this idea of a study in mind that I set out to write a small \"clarinet concerto\" for Gretchen Dunsmore and 175 East. While 'a study for voicing doubts' is a complete composition in its own right it's also a testing ground for ideas which may well be developed and extended when I get around to writing a larger-scale piece for clarinet and ensemble. This will of course be called 'Not a study for voicing doubts'. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Poems of a Bright Moon' for flute/alto flute, clarinet and piano was inspired by the Hsiang-Yang Songs of Li Po, an 8th-century Chinese poet of the T'ang Dynasty (ca.618-906 A.D.).  On a visit to New Mexico in the United States, the discovery of the poet William Carlos Williams and the art work of Georgia O'Keeffe led to the poetry of Li Po, which conjures up visions of mountains and rivers, also very much part of the New Mexico landscape.  Li Po was something of a mischievous travelling minstrel and liked to indulge in the drink somewhat.  A legend says that �while out drunk in a boat, he fell into a river and drowned trying to embrace the moon.�   The moon appears in over a third of his poems, and the opportunity to combine Li Po's images of moonlight with the rich dark tones of the alto flute was irresistible.  The individual titles of the movements of this piece come directly from the poems, and the music attempts to evoke the spirit of the titles: �Hsien mountain rises above emerald Han river,� �On a moonlit night, a recluse plays his pale white ch'in� and �A pure ten-thousand-mile wind arrives.�  'Poems of a Bright Moon' was commissioned by Ethos trio with funding assistance from Creative New Zealand."

The Gaelic title means �tunes for highland fiddle.�  Some of the tunes are obvious while others are almost hidden. 'Prologue' starts with a bang, and is followed by 'Hornpipe' where a familiar tune dances and then scurries away beneath a disguise of accompanying notes and rhythmic displacement.  'The Boatman' slows the pace and melodic decoration suggests the sound of bagpipes playing this rather wistful song.  Finally, Reel returns to the highly-charged drive of the 'Prologue' with a frantic and virtuosic ending.  'Ceol na Fidhle' was written in 1999 for Tasmanian musicians Rachel Bremner and Tom O'Kelly."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The drama and poetry of traditional Scots ballads have a universal appeal, but particularly for a com poser who (like many New Zealanders) has Scots ancestry. King Orfeo is unusual in that it is based on the Greek legend of Orpheus, who now plays the bagpipes rather than the lute; and doubly usual in that it has a happy ending with Orfeo rescuing his Isabel. The other two ballads are more typical in their themes of darkness and death. Lord Randal's story is told in dialogue with his mother; it is interesting that another dialogue-ballad, Edward, was set by Schubert towards the end of his life. These settings also exist in a version for voice and orchestra"

  internal_note: "Programme Note: I first heard Cilla McQueen reading her own poems at the opening of the new National Library building in August 1987. Among the poems the read was Synaesthesia, which entranced me with its sustained lyricism and seemed to be crying out for music � something very unusual in recent NZ poetry, most of which tends to be more conversational in tone. I asked her for a copy of Synaesthesia (at that stage unpublished) and later formed two other poems among her published collections. The musical connections between Synaesthesia and Princess Alice came quite unconsciously, though the two songs are very contrasted in rhythmic style: one flowing, the other dancing. In between, Solstice is suspended in stillness. "

This setting was lost, but I'm sure the new one is much better! Each of the songs is a celebration: the first of the silent singing of children sculpted in stone; the second of kite-flying; the third a hymn to God and nature; the fourth a love-song from the muddy trenches of World War 1; and the last one of Cummings' many songs of the joys of Spring.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Variations for Violin and Piano' was written in 1982 while Nigel Keay was studying composition at Victoria University of Wellington. The work won the inaugural Composition Competition there in 1982, being played on that occasion by Bruce Corlett (violin) & Hugh Stevenson (piano). It is a single movement work, and although tied in with the formal study requirements of the day, the piece saw the establishment of a personal style and harmonic language that developed along a path of �atonality� during the eighties. In fact the composer considers that this work marks the beginning of his catalogue. Nigel Keay played the violin part of this essentially abstract piece shortly after it was written, reflecting his desire to create a work that would be enjoyed by its performers."

This short work for large orchestra follows an A-B-A structure with the archetypal fanfare elements sounding out from the brass section. "

The first performance was given on the 27th November 1983 by the Amabile String Quartet (Alan Foster, Glenda Craven, Lyndsay Mountfort, Annemarie Meijers), the players all being members of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. The 'String Quartet No.1' was also performed at the National Art Gallery, Wellington in 1983, and at the University of Otago, Dunedin, NZ in 1986. 'String Quartet No.1' is a concise work written in an atonal and at times modernist language somewhat inspired by the music of Alban Berg and Arnold Schoenberg. The second movement is a kind of \"Second Viennese waltz\" - a reference to the Second Viennese School at the beginning of the 20th Century. "

The notes are grouped relatively closely around the centre of the keyboard to create 3 different transpositions of the melodic motif which creates a modulating effect. 'Piano Piece 2' is constructed using rhythmic groupings of 6 or 12 notes with some cross-rhythmic elements. 'Piano Piece 3' is written around the idea of harmonic resonance. 'Piano Piece 4' makes use of modes of limited transposition, in this case the reccuring tone/semitone/tone/semitone etc pattern derived from the last chord of Piano Piece 1. Piano Piece 4 was published in \"University Commissions 1984\" organised by the combined NZ University Music Depts. and printed by the University of Otago Music Department."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The idea of diffractions is represented in sound by the piano, central and prominent, exploiting an aspect of its technique to which it is ideally suited: rapid changes of direction and wide intervallic leaps with extreme dynamics. The orchestra provides bands of coloured spectra forming an integrated texture. The melody, oscillating and colourful is sometimes pointillistic and at other times it flows into longer continuous phrases. 'Diffractions' is essentially an abstract work in one continuous movement. 'Diffractions' was commissioned by the Dunedin Sinfonia (now called the Southern Sinfonia) with assistance from the Queen Elizabeth 11 Arts Council of New Zealand in December 1986, and was given its premiere performance by that orchestra conducted by Jack Speirs on September 13th 1987 with Terence Dennis as soloist. 'Diffractions' was performed at the 1987 \"Sonic Circus\" on October 31st by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra (NZSO) conducted by Francisco Feliciano with David Guerin as soloist. This performance was recorded by Radio New Zealand and broadcast on their Concert FM station. A performance of 'Diffractions' was given at the Nelson School of Music (NZ) by the Nelson Symphony Orchestra in April 1990 (Conductor: Miranda Adams with David Guerin as soloist). "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Aeolian Harp Sounds': In 1999, I designed an Aeolian Harp within a sculpture that would assist the wind flow across the strings, and provide a suitable resonant space in which people could enjoy the sounds.  in 2000, I constructed a small working model for display in the Christchurch Botanical Gardens as part of 'Scape: New Zealand Community Trust Art + Industry' Urban Arts Biennial 2002.  Aeolian Harps are magical instruments played by the wind.  Traditionally, all the strings are tuned to the same pitch, but on this recording the strings have been tuned randomly.  The variety of sounds that an Aeolian Harp can produce is astonishing: always ethereal and beautiful.  I have been elated with the success of the project amd the response from the public.  Both the sounds of the harp and the instrument itself seem to have a cognisant persona that has lead me on a spellbinding journey for the last twenty-five years.  Over this time, I have developed the design to include several unique innovations such as bridges that allow th estrings to lie perpendicular to the soundboard as opposed to parallel to it.  In some ways, I feel that as a composer, this is the first project where I have had some real communication with the community.  in other ways, however, I often feel that it is not I doing the communicating: rather it is Gaia or some undefined sentient energy that embodies the earth.  All I have done is simply construct a device that 'unlocks' these sounds.  To me, this is why the sounds have such a magical, even spiritual quality.  These sounds are best played softly."

  general_note: "Ritchie, A.: Beginnings for orchestra; cassette"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Beginnings' was commissioned by The Auckland Philharmonia. It was inspired by the birth of Ritchie's son Tristan. It depicts the slowly mounting tension of the labour, through to the birth itself. There is a gradual growth in the music from small, delicate gestures into wild and pulsating ones towards the end. The child is represented by a 'little Tristan waltz' which eventually gets caught up in the musical frenzy. The waltz sequence imposes order on the music, which tends to be fragmentary and changeable. There are some echoes of Bartok and Debussy in this early work, and it presents a good challenge for a professional orchestra. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In 1995 I was approached by the NZSO to write an overture to commemorate the recent death of New Zealand's most famous war hero, Sir Charles Upham. Upham was famous for having won the Victoria Cross twice for bravery during World War II. He was, however, extremely modest when it came to discussing his achievements. Some years before his death it was suggested to Upham that he have a state funeral; he simply replied \"A bugle will do\". This comment seemed like a good starting point for my piece. There are no bugles in the orchestra, but the opening section depicting the horrors of battle contains plenty of brass. Sub-titled 'Maleme and Ruweisat Ridge', the music is fast and furious, built from several motifs, and includes the opening rhythm for the most well known Maori haka (war dance), 'Kamate, kamate'. The music builds to a climax, and the scene changes to a bleak Colditz Castle, where Upham was imprisoned during the war. While in prison he dreams of rural NZ, and the farm near Kaikoura called 'Landsdowne', where he eventually settled after the war. This brief pastoral section links into a coda celebrating the outbreak of peace. Motifs from earlier in the piece return but changed into brighter modes. 'A Bugle Will Do' was first performed by the NZSO in 1996 under Andrew Sewell, and was subsequently performed in the USA."

'Bright Silence' was written while Gillian Whitehead was composer-in-residence with the Auckland Philharmonia, as the competition piece for the inaugural Michael Hill World Violin Competition, held at Queenstown, New Zealand, where it received its first eighteen performances in June 2001. The piece is dedicated to Michael Hill."

He believes that as well as producing sounds in every possible way to send messages to their own kind, all creatures have the urge to make some kind of music. The rhythmic sounds         emitted by all creatures might, Lewis suggests �be the recapitulation of something else - an earliest memory, a score for the transformation of inanimate random matter in chaos into the improbable ordered dance of living forms.� It was this essay, together with my fascination in the rediscovery of the part of Auckland I knew as a young child, that have shaped this piece. The basis of the piece is the twelve possible three-note groups which function to form molecular structures - harmonic, textural, gestural, melodic - some simple, some complex, often symmetrical.  The piece could be regarded as part of a classical tradition, in that it focuses primarily on balance of pitch and orchestration rather than on gesture or programmatic elements, and places the instrumental writing well within the range of the instruments rather than exploiting their extremes.  'The improbable ordered dance ----' is in a single movement and begins with a ghostly chant-like melody over a drone; this recurs in different forms several times during the piece. A transition section based on transformed sounds of nocturnal birds leads to a metrically free 'dawn chorus'. The following chorale-like passages and the rapid sections that follow are part of a restless upward-moving continuum which can never settle nor ever finish. The later sections of the piece recycle, combine and finally dissipate the earlier material."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Sinew/Synapse' is concerned with ideas of connection: the causal links between brain and body, score and sound, performance gesture and sonic result. The musical materials existed first as independent objects, which were then manipulated to draw out links between them. I was particularly interested in areas in which the acoustical systems of the instrument become unstable, where a precisely specified physical gesture will produce an unpredictable sonic result. Many of the sounds hover around the threshold of audibility, and the performer is constantly involved in a delicate balancing act. 'Sinew/Synapse' is dedicated to the cellist Robert Ibell, whose role in the music�s evolution was invaluable."

Music can be a kind of �outpouring�, a creative combustion that we try to make intelligible with words. The piece begins as a steady, simple walk � like strolling down an old wooden pier. The boards creak, nails shake loose, the whole rickety structure shudders and quakes. Right at the end of the wharf, where the water laps the wood, there's a barnacle � beautiful, ugly, and stubborn all at the same time. How can this small creature cling to one place for its entire life?"

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Section 1 - Bars 1 to 25  The haunting opening theme gives a sense of imbalance and cross rhythm. This, combined with polytonality and energetic counterpoint typifies the wide scope of disparate expression contained in this work.  The simple opening figures gain momentum and complexity in bar 2, then slow and slower until the robust introduction of the first of the round themes at bar 4. Varying degrees of counterpoint are juxtaposed in the succeeding phrases, along with the exploitation of three distinct themes in alternating patterns of rounds. The momentum is then diffused, winding down with trills and running semi-demi-quavers into the low bass of the piano alongside ponticello effects in the strings.  Unexpected harmonies and intense flourishes are balanced across the timbre of the ensemble. Ultimately runs of harmonic glissandi mark the end of the opening section. The ending purposely engenders a sense of perplexity, of not knowing what next to expect.  Section 2 - Bars 26 to 67 'Misterioso'  Bars 26-40 mark the first sub-section, followed by the second, bars 41 to 53 and the third, bar 54 to 67. Various devices, such as sequences and pauses are implemented to cause the momentum to surge and ebb. The different melodies and underlying contrapuntal fragments are in constant interplay throughout each sub-section. Each individual sub-section has a differing tone and timbre as different ideas come forth and are contemplated.  The third section comprises a great fugue which is a quadruple rhythmic elongation of the primary theme from section three('Calypso') that follows. This is treated in four parts contrapuntally, one of which is retrograde to the others. The rhythm gains momentum toward the end of the fugue to propel you into the third section.  Section 3 - Bars 68 to 158 'Calypso'  This lively, quick-paced, rambunctious section is hallmarked by virtuosic writing for all the instruments. Though not exactly in the style of a true Caribbean �calypso�, the repeated syncopation pattern in the piano gave rise to this title. Elaborate contrapuntal juxtapositions of past themes, with differing harmonies, clash and bounce off each other in a frenzy. The momentum is fuelled by the compelling refrain which first occurs at bar 94 and repeatedly in a chorus at the conclusion of the finale."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: �faccee'� is composed as a set of loosely related, programmatic movements which portray different moods through the day. �faccee'� is intended as a lighter work of chamber music with elements of mystery, humor, charm and satire.  'Dawn' begins the work slowly, with the darkness and solitude of morning blossoming full fruit into daylight, then relaxing into the day.  Movement two, 'Boogie', quickens the pace and is akin to experiences while walking the streets of the city.  The further one travels, the more activity one encounters until reaching the heart of the city, where a rousing canon surrounds you with people and congested traffic. Then, suddenly, you arrive at your destination and with one last exclamation are in the door.  'Daydream' is a brief visit into the realm of nostalgia and sentiment, with a pleasant, recurring melody in the english horn and violin. What better for a finale than an old-fashioned 'galop' ? This �galop� is, rather, a musical pun on the Viennese version. The 'Galop' gives way to the 'Trio Satirico' which pokes fun at traditional trios with a duple/triple reconfiguration of  9/8; making for a gawky feel.  Then on to the 'Finale' where themes from earlier in the day are revisited in a whirlwind finish."

  general_note: "Stabler: Quintro for five double basses; CD"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Quintro' was conceived as an electroacoustic, real-time performance work  using a standard acoustic  composition for five double basses along with the MAX  or Pro Tools computer program, for electro-  acoustic enhancement. Either electroacoustic enhancement, or a performance with straight and  unprocessed acoustic sound can be employed at the performers� discretion.  �Quintro� is designed to  showcase unlimited aspects in sound production for the double bass either way.  Basses 2& 4 work as a unit and should be placed together on one side of the stage, opposite basses  3& 5, who also work as a unit.  Solo bass 1 should then be located in the middle of the stage, between  the two groups.  The three movements are titled:  1. Smooth Flow  2. Ebb 3. Return 'Smooth Flow' begins the musical voyage in a relaxed, unhurried manner with the solo over top of a  constant quaver flow spread throughout the ensemble. The structure includes a retrograde in the solo  from mid-way to the end.  'Ebb' is largely abstract, with eerie glissando harmonics and low pedal drones. The ensemble conveys a  sense of improvisation, in contrast to the steady cross-rhythms  and melody of the outer movements.  Improvisation of any sort by the performers is encouraged by the composer for this movement.  �Return� picks up the pace for a speedy journey home. The constant, but faster quaver flow keeps the  momentum while the solo alternates different melodies and effects over the top. The work ends with a  recapitulation of a pizzicato segment from the �smooth flow� melody, at bar 34 of the first movement. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Scored for flute, clarinet, vibraphone/marimba, piano, violin, viola and cello, this piece was written for performance by members of the Stockhausen�s ensemble, including parts designed specifically for Aloys Kontarsky, Siegfried Palm, and Cristoph Caskel, who, at the time, were the world�s leading performers of contemporary music. To the composer it seemed unlikely the work could ever be played in New Zealand, although it is noteworthy that Douglas Lilburn chose this as the first score to publish under his newly founded Waiteata editions imprint, such was his admiration for the composer�s achievement. However, with growing numbers of skilled and committed performers in New Zealand, �For Seven� eventually received its New Zealand premiere in 1992, by the new music ensemble CadeNZa.  Since then it has had several other fine performances here, and well as others in Europe. Recognition of the work�s status within our musical canon can be judged from the simultaneous CD publication of two different versions of the work, one by the UK-based ensemble Lontano conducted by Odaline de la Martinez, and this present recording by Stroma. 'For Seven' was one of the first pieces to combine elements from the two major European schools of the time - the Eastern European cluster music, and the serialism of Boulez and Stockhausen. The piece consists of various lines of composed accelerandi and ritardandi, determined by a network of simple numerical ratios. These ratios also govern other aspects of the piece, such as the lengths of sections and the pitch intervals used. Combined with the highly structured �foreground� material is more amorphous �background� material (including some improvisatory elements), with frequent interaction between the two. Though the construction of the piece is complex, the result had a natural musicality and flow. McLeod has said that, although she was not conscious of it at the time of composition, she now hears clearly the influence of the sounds of the New Zealand bush. (Programme note: Mark Jones)."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Ahotu' is the sixth in a series of instrumental pieces based on the phases of the moon, and refers to the seventh day of the cycle. The entire thirty-day cycle has been used as one of the rhythmic generators of the piece, with vowels and consonants translated into durations to provide the apparently irrational rhythms, which are contrasted in a series of short ensemble or solo sections with either proportional or regular rhythms. The two longest sections are centrally placed. The first, featuring trombone and percussion, presents the language-based material in the percussion; the second, starting with the long piano solo, begins a mensural canon based on the proportional material. However, half-way through this canon, recapitulatory material begins, and subsequent appearances of the canon occur in continually shorter blocks, each transformed very differently. O Matenga, in the title of the piece, refers to the Maori custom, found also in many other civilisations, of providing sustenance for the spirit to the next world after death."

I wanted the audience to hear objects moving not only between left and right, but up and down, forward and backward.  I also tried to put the audience into a meditative mood and bring them to either my or their subconscious world.  The text used in this piece is my own; its meaning is metaphorical.  Different people may read it to mean diverse things, depending on their background.  It is helpful, but not necessary, to understand the original language used, becuase the texts contain subliminal thoughts and feelings.  As I wanted listeners to enjoy the work as sound without being distracted by the meaning of the text, the vocal part is integral to the soundscape."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Four Stabiles' was composed when I was newly graduated from university, after I had decided that I liked the idea of becoming a composer. Margaret Nielsen graciously gave it an early airing and the score was promptly published by Waiteata Press Music, giving me a tremendous boost of self-confidence. The �60s were a time when musical abstraction was the vogue, when a mathematical structure justified the music. Thus the inverted palindromic form of Stabile I based on its two versions of the all-interval symmetrically invertible 12-tone chord was a source of considerable composerly satisfaction!  All but one of the dedicatees, personal friends, have long since either drifted or passed away. The one remaining contact, William Dart, is characterised in Stabile III, a tender portrait of someone who was then living a curiously isolated existence. Tony (Stabile 1) I admired for his good looks and spiritual curiosity, while winsome Robert (Stabile 2) was the object of one of my compulsive crushes. Gaye (Stabile 4) was a passionately energetic fellow student at Teacher�s College, who, sadly, took her own life a few years later. These pieces use fixed register, that is, each note (C, C#, etc) is heard at only one register, creating a static vertical relationship between the pitches. Variety is achieved by viewing the �sound object� from different perspectives, just as a viewer explores a static sculptural structure (a stabile) by walking around it. Movements one and three permit two possible registers for each note by using two chords, one the inversion of the other. Another feature of the first movement is that it is palindromic. The gentle sounds of the Stabile 2 suggest a star-lit night, Stabile 4 strives for rhythmic momentum to counter the essentially static compositional technique, while an informed listener will easily recognise the debt that Stabile 3 owes to the first of Douglas Lilburn�s �Nine Short Pieces�.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: I have many reasons to thank Peter Nisbet, the General Manager of the NZ Symphony, who, through the 70�s and �80s, passed a series of commissions my way. How privileged I was to be invited to write for the best ensemble in the country! 'Little Elegies' was a particularly prestigious commission, with the concert recorded for telecast to the nation. I successfully argued that my piece, commissioned to mark the 25th anniversary of television in New Zealand, should exploit the medium itself, not simply be a telecast of the orchestral performance. And so, with the help of that wild man of television production, Peter Coates, we produced, at great speed and with few resources, an experimental video that inter-cut slow motion gestures of the conductor with what were sometimes quite harrowing topical television news clips. I don�t recollect what the reaction was to our provocative creation � perhaps nothing more than the Great Silence with which all New Zealand artists are familiar!  Although this work was commissioned as a celebration, I chose a sombre tone, to draw attention to some of the darker aspects of the popular media, particularly the trivialisation of human tragedy as mass entertainment. I had been deeply shocked after reading Dith Pran�s book �The Killing Fields� and seeing the movie of the same title, and felt that any kind of personal statement I could make would be insignificant besides the enormity of the horror; hence the �littleness� of my elegies for the suffering of the Cambodian people. In its first performance, 'Little Elegies' was conducted by Jose Serebrier."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: At certain times in life one feels the need to do or create something flashy. My Epicycle for string quartet of 1989 is one such piece, and my 'Three Rhythmics' for piano duet another. But virtuosity comes with a price � the work was rejected by the two pianists for whom it was first written, and has been a cause for complaint by the several duo pianists who have tackled it since. Indeed the style of virtuosity explored here is mechanistic, rather than Lisztian, and perhaps I am justified in presenting here a computer version as a kind of �model� performance; the last movement is labelled �Nancarrowesque� and perhaps that is the apt precedent to cite! But the several, albeit imperfect, live performances that I have heard have always been exhilarating; and so, perhaps, its demands do, after all, produce rewards�. The first movement of this piano duet alternates between double handed tremolando and repeated rhythmic cells that change relationship to each other, with some hand-clapping thrown in for good measure. A short interlude begins with a free, parlando style that gradually transforms itself into a metrical rhythm. The last movement pits the two performers against each other in an unstoppable flood of sound. Three Rhythmics, commissioned by the Music Federation of New Zealand, was premiered by Diane Cooper and Dan Poynton."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The 'Love Sonnets of Michelangelo' I wrote for Michael Parmenter with whom I worked on a programme entitled �Between Two Fires�. (Also included was a dance-theatre work I created collaboratively with Michael, using his voice as well as his body, with imagery extracted from the diaries of Franz Kafka.) At the time I was focused on different styles of melody, having just completed my Five Melodies for Piano. Inspired by the lovely voices of some of the then current students in our School of Music, I felt that women�s voices gave the expressive quality I wanted, as well as providing a useful �cover� for the overtly homoerotic tenor of the texts. The original production used film, shot by my good friend Bayley Watson, showed the dancer�s prostrate figure, swathed in bandages. As the performance unfolded the cloth was gradually cut and pealed back by hands belonging to an old man whose face we never saw, the intended metaphor being of the sculptor cutting away marble to reveal the male form that he sensed already existed within the stone. The work has since had other performances that have discarded the theatrical elements, most successfully when each setting is prefaced by a reading of the poem in translation. One of the greatest artists of all time, Michelangelo was also an important poet. These settings of some of his most personal sonnets articulate the anguish of love and desire, as well as the despair of old age. The musical style combines the theatricality of Italian bel canto with the direct expressivity of folksong. Love Sonnets of Michelangelo was originally sung by Leslie Graham and Linden Loader and danced by Michael Parmenter."

But a lullaby might not always be soporific, if we consider the state of mind of the singer, who may be singing as much for themselves, projecting onto the child their own anxieties, frustrations, aspirations, hopes. The musical language tries to suggest a folk-like simplicity; the invented languages likewise hinting at distant regions � no. I African perhaps? II Turkish? III Latinate? IV Pacific? In the final movement, the word �Calumbaya� is borrowed from the name of a Filipino friend�s barrio, a name so euphonious as to be irresistible.  Invariably, mature age is a time for surrendering to seductive nostalgia and sentimentality, the very things one had previously studiously avoided. But the challenge is to find true beauty in the banal, and mystery in common clich�, something I attempted in my several settings of old songs, remembering my dear, departed paternal grandmother, and also my hale and hearty 100 year-old father, whose musical tastes extend little further than old style tunes like these. Five Lullabies was composed in 1989 as a tribute to Peter Godfrey on his retirement, and was first performed in its entirety by the Tudor Consort. Musically, they were partly inspired by my discovery of the wonderful vocal polyphonies of some of China�s minority cultures, sometimes characterised by the so-called �dissonant� interval of a 2nd being held to resonate as a consonant.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Written in McLeod�s second year of study at Victoria University, this piece shows influences of Benjamin Britten and David Farquhar. The text is a poem by W. S. Broughton, the older brother of one of her childhood friends. She was drawn to the poem because it expressed the disillusionment with religion she herself was experiencing at the time. Being a student work, 'Epithalamia' has been somewhat neglected by performers, and has only recently been �rediscovered�. Its recording here attests to the youthful composer�s impressive self-confidence, both in the expressive use of the voice and in the effective piano writing. (Programme note: Mark Jones)."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Scored for flute, clarinet, vibraphone/marimba, piano, violin, viola and cello, this piece was written for performance by members of the Stockhausen�s ensemble, including parts designed specifically for Aloys Kontarsky, Siegfried Palm, and Cristoph Caskel, who, at the time, were the world�s leading performers of contemporary music. To the composer it seemed unlikely the work could ever be played in New Zealand, although it is noteworthy that Douglas Lilburn chose this as the first score to publish under his newly founded Waiteata editions imprint, such was his admiration for the composer�s achievement. However, with growing numbers of skilled and committed performers in New Zealand, �For Seven� eventually received its New Zealand premiere in 1992, by the new music ensemble CadeNZa.  Since then it has had several other fine performances here, and well as others in Europe. Recognition of the work�s status within our musical canon can be judged from the simultaneous CD publication of two different versions of the work, one by the UK-based ensemble Lontano conducted by Odaline de la Martinez, and this present recording by Stroma. 'For Seven' was one of the first pieces to combine elements from the two major European schools of the time - the Eastern European cluster music, and the serialism of Boulez and Stockhausen. The piece consists of various lines of composed accelerandi and ritardandi, determined by a network of simple numerical ratios. These ratios also govern other aspects of the piece, such as the lengths of sections and the pitch intervals used. Combined with the highly structured �foreground� material is more amorphous �background� material (including some improvisatory elements), with frequent interaction between the two. Though the construction of the piece is complex, the result had a natural musicality and flow. McLeod has said that, although she was not conscious of it at the time of composition, she now hears clearly the influence of the sounds of the New Zealand bush. (Programme note: Mark Jones)."

The body of the piece is melodic and harmonious, but is framed by abstract episodes. To achieve these abstract sounds, the cello plays microtones and a few varieties of distortion effects, some sounding as birds. The piano is �prepared� by inserting a small piece of foam rubber under the lowest octave of strings and also by having the player strum directly on the strings with either a piece of felt or a rubber piano tuner�s mute.  As the title suggests, farewell  includes elements of nostalgia, mystery, and pathos. The feelings one may have on saying good-bye to the present and viewing the future with a bit of apprehension.  A time for re-evaluation. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In 1909 Alice Adcock, a lively and adventurous young woman from Manchester, was on her way to New Zealand. She was 23, and had recently developed TB, for which there was then no cure. Somehow she persuaded her widowed father to let her travel alone to the other side of the world in case a healthy climate would save her life. (It worked � she lived for another 50 years). The family kept her entertaining letter describing shipboard life, and a few postcards from her have also survived, but most of what we know about her time in New Zealand comes from her father�s letters to her, of which he kept copies, or from family tradition. On her arrival in New Zealand, Alice went into service, travelling widely, much to the consternation of her father. As housekeeper (and the only woman) on a farm in Makarora (a remote settlement on Lake Wanaka) she became pregnant to an unknown man, but was �rescued� by marriage to a local farmer, Charles Pipson, shortly before the birth of her daughter. In 1911, her beloved father died; in 1912, Alice and Charles had a son and the following year, pregnant again, Alice took her children back to England to visit her family. Tragically, while she was away, her husband died suddenly of typhoid fever. Alice hurried back to Makarora to claim her inheritance, but left the two babies with her brother Sam and his wife (who were shortly to emigrate to New Zealand) and took only her eldest child, the illegitimate one, with her. This outraged her sisters-in-law, who saw it as an insult to their dead brother; they sent her away from the farm empty-handed. Once again she had to take a housekeeping job, this time in the North Island. In 1914, Alice and her brother�s family met up again, and Alice began a new life. (Fleur Adcock � abridged) The music of Alice is text-driven, ranging between a language at times extremely simple, as was the basic musical language of the settlers, and at times quite complex, evoking a storm at sea, or the unease of the settlers in a new environment, or Alice�s reaction to the problems which beset her. The piece is held together by various referential motifs. The initial idea, which perhaps suggests the instability of the sea, is also present in the bell-like sounds marking Charles� death, music associated with a storm at sea is later associated with mental stress, while music suggestive of the movement of shipboard lice later underlies Alice�s traumatic encounter with her sisters-in-law. There are eight sections, which often merge into one another: 1. in a letter to her father, Alice describes shipboard life; 2. in New Zealand, she compares her past life and hopes for the future; 3. a dialogue between father and daughter, expressed through their letters; 4. in Makarora, Alice discovers she is pregnant; 5. Alice hears of her father�s death; 6. in England, she learns of her husband�s death; 7. back in Makarora, Alice is turned away by her sisters-in-law; 8. turning her back on the South Island, Alice looks forward to her new life with her brother�s family in the north. While writing this piece, I was drawn again and again into the thought that, although this is a true story, set in a particular place at a certain time, it has the resonances of a universal myth, known to all of us who live here. Our forebears, or we ourselves, have crossed the seas to begin a new life, with unforeseen and unimaginable difficulties and felicities, whether ten years, a century or a millennium or so ago. "

  general_note: "Stabler: Quintro; CD"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Quintro' was conceived as an electroacoustic, real-time performance work  using a standard acoustic  composition for five double basses along with the MAX  or Pro Tools computer program, for electro-  acoustic enhancement. Either electroacoustic enhancement, or a performance with straight and  unprocessed acoustic sound can be employed at the performers� discretion.  �Quintro� is designed to  showcase unlimited aspects in sound production for the double bass either way.  Basses 2& 4 work as a unit and should be placed together on one side of the stage, opposite basses  3& 5, who also work as a unit.  Solo bass 1 should then be located in the middle of the stage, between  the two groups.  The three movements are titled:  1. Smooth Flow  2. Ebb 3. Return 'Smooth Flow' begins the musical voyage in a relaxed, unhurried manner with the solo over top of a  constant quaver flow spread throughout the ensemble. The structure includes a retrograde in the solo  from mid-way to the end.  'Ebb' is largely abstract, with eerie glissando harmonics and low pedal drones. The ensemble conveys a  sense of improvisation, in contrast to the steady cross-rhythms  and melody of the outer movements.  Improvisation of any sort by the performers is encouraged by the composer for this movement.  �Return� picks up the pace for a speedy journey home. The constant, but faster quaver flow keeps the  momentum while the solo alternates different melodies and effects over the top. The work ends with a  recapitulation of a pizzicato segment from the �smooth flow� melody, at bar 34 of the first movement. "

  general_note: "Stabler: Piano Trio No. 1; CD"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: Section 1 - Bars 1 to 25  The haunting opening theme gives a sense of imbalance and cross rhythm. This, combined with polytonality and energetic counterpoint typifies the wide scope of disparate expression contained in this work.  The simple opening figures gain momentum and complexity in bar 2, then slow and slower until the robust introduction of the first of the round themes at bar 4. Varying degrees of counterpoint are juxtaposed in the succeeding phrases, along with the exploitation of three distinct themes in alternating patterns of rounds. The momentum is then diffused, winding down with trills and running semi-demi-quavers into the low bass of the piano alongside ponticello effects in the strings.  Unexpected harmonies and intense flourishes are balanced across the timbre of the ensemble. Ultimately runs of harmonic glissandi mark the end of the opening section. The ending purposely engenders a sense of perplexity, of not knowing what next to expect.  Section 2 - Bars 26 to 67 'Misterioso'  Bars 26-40 mark the first sub-section, followed by the second, bars 41 to 53 and the third, bar 54 to 67. Various devices, such as sequences and pauses are implemented to cause the momentum to surge and ebb. The different melodies and underlying contrapuntal fragments are in constant interplay throughout each sub-section. Each individual sub-section has a differing tone and timbre as different ideas come forth and are contemplated.  The third section comprises a great fugue which is a quadruple rhythmic elongation of the primary theme from section three('Calypso') that follows. This is treated in four parts contrapuntally, one of which is retrograde to the others. The rhythm gains momentum toward the end of the fugue to propel you into the third section.  Section 3 - Bars 68 to 158 'Calypso'  This lively, quick-paced, rambunctious section is hallmarked by virtuosic writing for all the instruments. Though not exactly in the style of a true Caribbean �calypso�, the repeated syncopation pattern in the piano gave rise to this title. Elaborate contrapuntal juxtapositions of past themes, with differing harmonies, clash and bounce off each other in a frenzy. The momentum is fuelled by the compelling refrain which first occurs at bar 94 and repeatedly in a chorus at the conclusion of the finale."

The work was written in 2001, at the time of President Bush's State of the Union address shortly before the invasion of Afghanistan, and suggests the fragility rather than the celebration of peace, particularly in a pre-European environment. A number of instruments used in Hineputehue are made of gourds - the gourd, which carried food and water, is a symbol of peace. These include the poi awiowhio, a very quiet bird lure which is swung around the head, the tiny koauau ponga ihu or noseflute which ends the piece, the hue puru hau, a large gourd which is blown across its top opening and the gourd rattles played by the quartet. Two other wind instruments frequently made from gourds, the nguru and the ororuarangi, are also used. Other instruments are the putatara or conch shell trumpet, traditionally used for signalling, the pu kaea or war trumpet, a nguru niho paraoa or flute made from a whale's tooth, the pumotomoto, associated with birth, and tumutumu (tapped percussion). There is a similarity between the stringed instruments of the quartet and the gourds, in that they are made from plant material, with sound emitted through sound holes. Another link is the ku, the only stringed instrument known to Maori, which is a small musical bow played like a jaws harp (jews harp) using the mouth as a resonating chamber. The idea of ororuarangi, which can be translated as spirit voice (or double stopping in a different context) has had some influence on this piece as in the parallel movement of the strings. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In the tradition of the Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, Hine Raukatauri is the goddess of music and dance. She is embodied in the form of the female case-moth, who hangs in the bushes and sings in a pure, high voice to attract the male moths to her.  Her hair is found as a fern, the hanging spleenwort, and her voice is heard in the sound of the putorino, an instrument known only in Aotearoa (the Maori name for New Zealand). The putorino is an instrument that can be played in various ways � as a flute, as a trumpet and as a means of enhancing or altering the human voice. 'Hine Raukatauri' is written for two performers, one playing conventional flutes (piccolo, C and alto flutes), and the other for taonga puoro (instruments). The score features three different putorino, which, like all taonga puoro, (and also the songs and chants) have a small pitch range, rarely exceeding a fourth, which varies from instrument to instrument. Three putorino are used in this piece � one made of albatross bone and two of wood, and both the flute and trumpet voices are used. Other instruments used are a karanga manu (bird-caller), a purerehua (swung bull-roarer) and tumutumu (tapped instruments.)  The flute player�s part is notated, but the music for the taonga puoro is improvised; there are areas when the flute player is encouraged to improvise with the taonga."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Symphony in Five Movements' was composed in Auckland in 1995/96 for the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra as part of its Composer-in-Residence programme. It was first performed on the 1st August 1996 in a concert at the Aotea Centre, Auckland as part of a Main Series programme. A central idea to the 'Symphony' concerns aspects of timing. Its form was partially inspired by the martial arts treatise 'Go Rin No Sho' (A Book of Five Rings), which considers timing and its relationship to strategy.  The five books are: Ground, Water, Fire, Wind & Void. There is a loose correspondence between the inspiration behind some of the movements and each of the �books.� Thus, the third movement refers to the book of tradition �wind,�and consequently, is modelled on a scherzo, not only paying tribute to Beethoven, but in a broader sense indicating the desire to give the entire work a historical reference.  The Introduction or first movement is analogous to the �ground� book (the path), outlining the Symphony�s musical ideas. The fifth movement (�void�) has a strongly rhythmic structure with contemporary influence throughout, reflected in, and overlayed with its violin-based lyrical stream. This strongly linear work was described by Denys Trussell in a subsequent review for 'Quote Unquote' after its Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra performance in 1996 (conducted by Enrique Diemecke) as being \"rich with feeling and atmosphere.\" The fourth and fifith movements were given a reading by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra conducted by Hamish McKeich at the NZSO - SOUNZ Readings in October 2001 in Wellington.

The 'Fanfare' was commissioned as part of the APO's Composer-in-Residence programme to open a special concert to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. This short work for large orchestra follows an A-B-A structure with the archetypal fanfare elements sounding out from the brass section. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Symphonic Poem: Ritual Dance of the Unappeasable Shadow' was commissioned by the Dunedin Sinfonia (now called the Southern Sinfonia) in 1993. It is a single movement work based on material from the opera 'At the Hawk's Well'. In some cases there has been extensive reworking, affecting also its construction which follows an arch form with a lively opening and closing. 'Symphonic Poem' was given a workshop reading by the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Sir William Southgate in 1994. This event was recorded by Radio New Zealand's Concert FM. It was also performed by the New Zealand Secondary School's Symphony Orchestra in 1995 as part of its Auckland Course. Peter Adams wrote of the work in a review for the Otago Daily Times (August 1, 1994): \"Nigel Keay's 'Ritual Dance of the Unappeasable Shadow' made a powerful impact on first hearing; the dark core of the work had a brooding intensity while the flanking outer sections were vital and colourful with their Indonesian gamelan-inspired sound world.\" "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'String Quartet No.2' was composed in Devonport, Auckland, between November 1994 and February 1995 with financial assistance provided by the New Zealand Composers� Foundation and the Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa. The first performance was given at the Watershed Theatre, Auckland on the 10th March 1995 by Simon McLellan & Sarah Hart (violins), Judith Williams (cello) and with the composer as violist. Denys Trussell wrote in a subsequent review (Quote Unquote, April 1995): \"Nigel Keay...had his substantial and dramatic Second Quartet given its first performances at these concerts. It is in part a synthesis of the strictly modernist and the freer post-modernist harmonic constructions: Keay is moving away from a music of sustained dissonance in this work towards a music where consonance and dissonance interact. The middle movement, slow and introspective, is a striking instance of this.\" Since then 'String Quartet No.2' has established itself as one of the composer�s most-performed, and most widely-performed works having been played in New Zealand, Thailand, Japan, France and Germany by several different formations. Nigel Keay's 'Second String Quartet' was performed at the 17th Conference and Festival of the Asian Composers League in Bangkok by the Ensemble Contemporary Alpha (Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music), and at the �Stella Nova� Concerts in Tokyo. It has been performed also in NZ by Ensemble Philharmonia (members of the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra), and the Nevine String Quartet (Elizabeth Patchett & Janet Armstrong - violins, Peter Barber - Viola, & Robert Ibell - Cello (members of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra)) (recording and broadcast by Radio NZ's Concert FM). It received performances in 2004 & 2005 by the Quatuor Aphan�s in Paris and Germany. The writing of the quartet was inspired by a love of the medium, particularly as a player having experienced the late quartets of Beethoven and other repertoire."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This symphony has three movements. All three start with the same pulse (   = 60), and the third movement also ends at this tempo. Both the rhythmic conflicts in the music and its rhythmic connections (changes of tempo within a movement) are related in the ratio 3:2. This ratio also expresses the interval of a fifth, which is throughout an important arrival point and is the music's final destination.These conflicts and changes are also associated with timbre: very often strings and brass are opposed with wind and percussion acting as mediators. The first movement is most concerned with conflicts. The opening idea announces this very simply with an opposition of two pentatonic modes (black and white keys on a keyboard), and this conflict remains unresolved at the end of the movement. The second movement alternates - combining slow movement and scherzo. The slow beginning presents an unwinding melodic line in the wind against a haze of overlapping chords on brass and strings. The fast scherzo breaks across this and tosses rhythmic fragments from section to section. The slow and fast are later combined, but in the end the fast wins, finishing the movement at breakneck speed. The third movement emphasises connections and resolutions.It is a set of variations on a chorale-like tune, starting at the basic pulse and gradually getting faster until the final variation, a quick waltz, is moving at three times the opening speed. From here the tempo shifts back and the chorale tune is combined with references to the beginning of the first movement."

The first movement is the most substantial, and near the beginning introduces a three-note figure (on horns and trumpet), which permeates the whole work. The three final movements - scherzo, slow march and epilogue - are played without a break."

'Serenade for Ann Morris' spans four sections in one movement, of which the second is for strings alone, and the third is an oboe cadenza. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Poems of a Bright Moon' for flute/alto flute, clarinet and piano was inspired by the Hsiang-Yang Songs of Li Po, an 8th-century Chinese poet of the T'ang Dynasty (ca.618-906 A.D.).  On a visit to New Mexico in the United States, the discovery of the poet William Carlos Williams and the art work of Georgia O'Keeffe led to the poetry of Li Po, which conjures up visions of mountains and rivers, also very much part of the New Mexico landscape.  Li Po was something of a mischievous travelling minstrel and liked to indulge in the drink somewhat.  A legend says that �while out drunk in a boat, he fell into a river and drowned trying to embrace the moon.�   The moon appears in over a third of his poems, and the opportunity to combine Li Po's images of moonlight with the rich dark tones of the alto flute was irresistible.  The individual titles of the movements of this piece come directly from the poems, and the music attempts to evoke the spirit of the titles: �Hsien mountain rises above emerald Han river,� �On a moonlit night, a recluse plays his pale white ch'in� and �A pure ten-thousand-mile wind arrives.�  'Poems of a Bright Moon' was commissioned by Ethos trio with funding assistance from Creative New Zealand."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This is a liturgical work for Congregation, Choir, Tenor or Soprano, Violin and Piano, which was originally composed for the Asperges Rite in the 150th Jubilee Mass of the Wellington Archdiocese, 30 April 2000.  It is inspired by the story of Christ and the Samaritan woman. The text in Maori and English is from the Gospel of John, Chapter 4 Verse 14: � The water that I shall give will turn into a spring inside you, welling up to eternal life.��Te Puna Waiora� is dedicated to Fr John Greally, Advisor for Pastoral Liturgy and Spirituality in the Wellington Archdiocese. Subsequently, the choral part has been incorporated into the Mass, �Te Miha Tuituia� published in �Music for a New Millennium� by the Auckland Liturgy Centre. Also, the chorale theme is in the final section of the harp solo piece � Otari� (2004)."

The work was premiered at the Nelson Composers' Workshop in 2002 and has received subsequent performances at the 2003 ACL Forum in Seoul, Korea, and at the neue musik aus neuseeland festival at the Musikhochschule L�beck in 2006.

The musical materials existed first as independent objects, which were then manipulated to draw out links between them. I was particularly interested in areas in which the acoustical systems of the instrument become unstable, where a precisely specified physical gesture will produce an unpredictable sonic result. Many of the sounds hover around the threshold of audibility, and the performer is constantly involved in a delicate balancing act. 'Sinew/Synapse' is dedicated to the cellist Robert Ibell, whose role in the music�s evolution was invaluable."

Revisiting the school sportsfield, rush is named after the rugby technique of moving the ball forward with short kicks and runs."

The work is dedicated to Katherine Austin (piano) and Richard Foreman (clarinet), who gave the premiere performance in the Illot Concert Chamber, Wellington, during the ExtravaCANZa festival of November 1994.  Mythology tells that on account of his aggression and lust, Ixion was lashed to a blazing wheel by Zeus, and sent whirling through the air to eternity. This work is the composer's response to the sad fate of Ixion."

Encountering these sculptures in the British Museum for the first time, I was intrigued to learn that one of the decorative motifs adorning its carved stone form was known as �egg and tongue�. The sensuously rounded forms of eggs and tongues alternate and repeat along the borders of the monumental sculptures, an ancient pattern combining symbols of virility and fertility. The motif is widespread: several years later, walking through the ruined architecture of the Syrian city of Apamea, I found tumbled-down stones of Roman structures bearing this same pattern, rain-washed stones in a field of crocuses.  In the music of �Egg and Tongue�, I play with ideas of patterning and fragmentation, cultural property and style. Familiar motifs repeat, adorn, are lost and take new shapes."

It opens with an expression of te taha wairua of two Aotearoa cultures (Karanga and Gregorian Chant \"Veni Sancte Spiritus\"), then a journey away from te taha wairua and te taha aroha towards greed and materialism (Corporate Beat, Haka). This leads to experiences of pain, confusion and abuse (I Crave That Place, Waiata Tangi ), out of which come insights, hope and a sense of self-worth ( Kia Hoatu He Tumanaako, Karakia ki te Wairua Tapu), to embrace energetically and enthusiastically the questions and challenges of the new millenium : about individuals-in-community, and social and cultural values based on  te aroha and te taha wairua (Nga Porowhita Aroha).  \"Tete Kura\" is a bicultural, collaborative composition for choir, kapa haka, kai-karanga and solo soprano and tenor. The music was composed by Helen Fisher, Ngapo and Pimia Wehi and Taru mai-i-tawhiti Kerehoma. The lyrics were written by Ngapo and Pimia Wehi, John Greally, Oriini Kaipara, Helen Fisher, as well as including some biblical extracts. \"Tete Kura\" was performed by Te Waka Huia and the New Zealand Youth Choir for the Wellington Youth Arts 2000 Festival,  being funded by a project grant from Creative New Zealand Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Elegy' is my personal reflection on the events of September 11th, 2001, their aftermath and the fixation on and use of violence in our global culture.  Although the piece took me just over six months to complete, I started writing it shortly after the attacks on the Twin Towers.  I was living in Wells, and was physically very distanced from the events that the world observed taking place in America and later in Afghanistan, Bali, Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Spain. In this piece, I am exploring both the horrific tragedy of the situation, and the American response to that day.  It is an emotional response to the tragedy and not in any way programmatic.  Essentially �Elegy� is a work full of hope. Hope that it is possible to find better ways to resolve conflict within our world. Hope that it is possible for different cultures and beliefs to coexist with understanding and tolerance for others. Hope that people will not see everything as black and white with only one right way or answer and not be influenced by ignorance or greed."

Encountering these sculptures in the British Museum for the first time, I was intrigued to learn that one of the decorative motifs adorning its carved stone form was known as �egg and tongue�. The sensuously rounded forms of eggs and tongues alternate and repeat along the borders of the monumental sculptures, an ancient pattern combining symbols of virility and fertility. The motif is widespread: several years later, walking through the ruined architecture of the Syrian city of Apamea, I found tumbled-down stones of Roman structures bearing this same pattern, rain-washed stones in a field of crocuses.  In the music of �Egg and Tongue�, I play with ideas of patterning and fragmentation, cultural property and style. Familiar motifs repeat, adorn, are lost and take new shapes."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: At an Auckland Philharmonia fund-raising auction in 2000, one of the orchestra's most generous sponsors, Dr Tom Morris, bid a substantial amount for a short ensemble piece to be written by the composer-in-residence. His was the choice of ensemble and title; the first performance  was given in the Auckland Town Hall at the orchestra's 21st birthday celebrations in 2001, where it was played as a surprise for his wife, Ann, to whom it is dedicated, and whose birthday it also was.  'Serenade for Ann Morris' spans four sections in one movement, of which the second is for strings alone, and the third is an oboe cadenza. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This is the \"permanent exhibit\" from the work in progress called 'given what we gather takes place'. The model for the whole work is that of a museum in which some exhibits are on permanent display, and others are brought up from the storeroom. In other words, some sections of music are always to be played, while others are chosen by the performers from a pool of material to present a unique exhibition for each performance. The percussionist's instrumental collection is similarly assembled; some categories of instruments are specified while others are chosen by the percussionist with the added stipulation that some aspect of the instruments chosen must be unique to the location of the performance. The music of this particular \"exhibit\" alludes to, but does not use, folk-like material and is conceived as a playful sparring match between two friendly opponents.  'given what we gather takes place' was commissioned by Resonate Duo, to whom it is dedicated, with funding from Creative New Zealand."

The two main themes were originally written by the Composer as sound tracks for television commercials, and reworked and developed for this overture.   The influence of film music is very evident in the orchestral scoring, with long sweeping melodies visualizing the wide open spaces and the modern rhythms of today's 'pop' music.  Youth of Auckland  has been recorded several times for CD and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra's version is played regularly on New Zealand National Radio. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work was commissioned by Auckland accordionist, Harley Jones, for performance in New York, August 1988, but was premiered in Auckland in 1987.  In the first two years it received 36 performances worldwide and was recorded by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra with Harley as soloist. Performed frequently internationally, several other recordings have been made of this work.  Rhapsody combines the sensitivity, expressive and distinct tone colours of the accordion with the full power of a symphony orchestra.  This performance was recorded live in concert, 13 October 2005, in Olomouc, Czech Republic, with the composer conducting the Moravian Philharmonic Orchestra."

It is a terrain of glossy expensive shops, designer boutiques, bars, restaurants and street caf�s.

  general_note: "Daverne: Gallipoli; EMI"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Gallipoli' was composed in memory of the World War I battle that took place between Turkey and Anzacs, symbolizing as a whole, the mutual good relations of the countries of Turkey, Australia and New Zealand, which are in friendly relations in our day. The message given by Turkey's leader Atat�rk after the war was one of humanism and friendship. This is still commemorated by both the ANZACs and the Turks with great importance every year. This work was premi�red on 16 May 2003 by the Turkish State Symphony Orchestra of Bursa with Turkey's renowned trumpeter Erden Bilgen as soloist and conducted by the composer.   The idea of writing this solo work for trumpet was born when Erden Bilgen met the composer in Auckland.  It became formalized with the composer's visit to Gallipoli in 2001 and a subsequent meeting between the two in Istanbul.  Written in Rhapsodic form in one movement, the music is not intended to interpret the horrors and negative aspects of war, but more the emotions and reflective times of the young ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corp.) and Turkish troops summoned to war on Turkish ground.  The opening trumpet fanfare is the call to war. In the middle section the composer uses a traditional folk theme from the Turkish region of Canakkale.  There is a short cadenza and the orchestration requires a large symphony orchestra."

The setting for this opera is mainly in the northern region of New Zealand in the 1830s, leading up to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. The main theme based on the expression Tribal Ritual and Pacific Island drum rhythms (Tongan) are the major features in the structure of the composition."

In the late 19th and early 20th century it was famous for its hunts, garden parties, dances, music and friendly welcomes, which is still evident today.  The atmosphere of the Victorian period, with the ballroom and spacious grounds, is captured in this music.   The powerful brass chords show the strong character of Allan Kerr Taylor, owner and builder of this stately home.  The spirits of the three unmarried daughters, the last family residents, are solo woodwind features.  The shimmering tremolo string passages and harp arpeggios depict the 'ghostly' games played by Aunt Muriel on the children. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This work another commissioned work, this time by the Kaipara District Council, in honour of long time accordion and arts supporter and lifetime member of the New Zealand Accordion Association, the late Mrs. Jenny Cocurullo.  A respected and loved citizen of Dargaville, the main town in the Kaipara region in the north of New Zealand, Jenny always promoted the Kaipara as the 'Gem of the North'.  She in turn was considered 'The Gem of the Kaipara'.   Written for solo accordion with string orchestra and percussion, the Gem of the Kaipara was premiered in Dargaville on 11 May 2002, where it was performed by the Auckland Symphony with New Zealand accordion soloist Kevin Friedrich, and conducted by the composer.  Written in simple sonata form, the introduction of the piece is quite mysterious in nature, with the lower strings providing a subtle bagpipe-like drone.  The airy melody and soft percussive effects are reminiscent of the awakening of the lush majestic Kauri tree forests and countryside of the Kaipara Flats with its blanketing dawn fog.  The main themes are written around Jenny's name and the name of the region  'Kaipara'. The lyrical re-occurring melody is first heard by the accordion with string accompaniment and then switches to the string accompanied by the accordion.    After working through an animated and rhythmical jig-like section portraying Jenny's boundless energy, various interests and Scottish heritage, the strings restate the soaring melody expressing the vast expansiveness and sweeping landscapes of the Kaipara region."

The title is taken from an essay by Fran�ois Bayle, which discusses the phenomenology of musical experience in richly poetic language. While not to be taken literally, this phrase reflects the play of energies in the music, and the transfer of energy between different regions, an evanescent surface, subject to unseen subterranean forces."

Deep in the bush where there were no cicadas singing, the moist smell of soil, a small stream, dark ferns.  Occasional streaks of sunlight struck the water.  The middle of the ponga fern looked as if it would be a perfect bed to curl up in.  I half believed that there were bush-dwelling creatures that did live and sleep there, watching me from the shadows."

The first movement is energetic in character, while the second is sad and melancholic, with a slowly rocking idea being suggestive of  a lullaby. The third movement is obsessive in rhythm, with a gentler contrasting middle section.  After a reflective opening, the finale burst into a rustic, dance-like mood.  Towards the end, various motifs from earlier movements are integrated into the texture and the work ends with a flourish.   This is a substantial, yet approachable work for professional musicians.   1. Allegro  2. Like a lullaby  3. allegro pesante  4. misterioso - allegro molto   "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: My first experiences of the soundworlds of Mahler's late orchestral works revealed to me the vast distances over which late romantic harmonic language can transport the listener. I was instantly taken by the immense power generated by Mahler's continual re-casting of the opening melodies of the Ninth (last mvt) and Tenth (first mvt) Symphonies, in subtlely or radically new harmonic and orchestrational contexts. One waits in expectation of the return of the opening and, no matter whether it's the first or the fiftieth hearing, is stunned by the genius of the new twist applied. 'Aufsatz' (German for \"essay\") is my attempt at capturing - in some very small way - the gist of Mahler's regenerative methods. The piece is a lopsided sonata form, where an angular development is followed by a vastly expanded recapitulation, which culminates in a perpetual re-spinning of the opening material, cut short by a brief and optimistic coda. 'Aufsatz' is dedicated to my piano teacher from an early age, Margaret Carryer. Read by the NZSO in November 2003, with a further �broadcast standard� reading in 2006.  Hamish McKeich conducted on both occasions."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In contrast to the singular, organic process of solo for cello this piece plays with the idea of juxtaposing contrasting fragments of material. It was stimulated by a book of dream symbols, in the form of simple gouache paintings, originating in the Rajasthan Gujarat area of Western India in the early 19th century.  The book is one of any number of dream lexicons to be found in ancient eastern cultures that guided the interpretation of dreams using mythological and cultural symbols pertaining to fortune and destiny. Although the Rajasthan Gujarat lexicon informs aspects of the aesthetic of the piece, it is not intended that the music function as an illustration of the visual images themselves.  Rather: whereas the pictures seek to make concrete the ephemeral matter of the dream, the music embodies an attempt both to restore the subjective nature of the dreamscape and to reconstruct the grammar of its articulation in time - concentrated, disjunct and fleeting. This occurs perhaps in the way that one might attempt to reconstruct a paragraph in an archaic language from its written symbols, without having access to their original source or context, guided only by intuitions based on experience of one's own language - in this case the 'language' of the dream. The title of the piece is borrowed from one of the images of the Rajasthan Gujarat lexicon. Water Mountain was composed for Apartment House 1999. It has been performed in Reading, New Zealand (175E ensemble 2002), Seoul (ACL festival 2003) and Brighton (Soundwaves festival, 2007) and broadcast by Radio NZ."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Because of the limitations of range of the instruments (only the piano has extremes of range), their different tuning systems and the fact that only the clarinet among the wind instruments has possibilities of extended techniques.  This piece explores more \"classical\" ideas than some of my other recent pieces.  The work uses a set of six notes as its basic idea: sounded together they have a restless quality, but the structure of the set provides both diversity and connection between the sound worlds of the piece.  Quintet is in a single movement with several sections. At the outset, a variety of ideas and textures are presented, not unlike moment form, but not using the extremities of classical moment form. A second section, over a piano pedal, initiates an exchange between  the bassoon and other instruments. This leads to a rapid scherzo-like section, with a monodic trio. It is closely followed by a slow movement, based on a close-range melody that is a tribute to Hirini Melbourne, who died during the writing of this section. The oboe cadenza which follows is the structural centre of the quartet, and is followed by a reworking in reverse of the material already presented. The ending leaves the piece unresolved.  Quintet was commissioned by Chamber Music New Zealand, with funding from Creative New Zealand, for the Brisbane- based Southern Cross Soloists, who included it in Chamber Music New Zealand's 2003 Celebrity Season, giving the first performance in Palmerston North on July 10th.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In 1909 Alice Adcock, a lively and adventurous young woman from Manchester, was on her way to New Zealand. She was 23, and had recently developed TB, for which there was then no cure. Somehow she persuaded her widowed father to let her travel alone to the other side of the world in case a healthy climate would save her life. (It worked � she lived for another 50 years). The family kept her entertaining letter describing shipboard life, and a few postcards from her have also survived, but most of what we know about her time in New Zealand comes from her father�s letters to her, of which he kept copies, or from family tradition. On her arrival in New Zealand, Alice went into service, travelling widely, much to the consternation of her father. As housekeeper (and the only woman) on a farm in Makarora (a remote settlement on Lake Wanaka) she became pregnant to an unknown man, but was �rescued� by marriage to a local farmer, Charles Pipson, shortly before the birth of her daughter. In 1911, her beloved father died; in 1912, Alice and Charles had a son and the following year, pregnant again, Alice took her children back to England to visit her family. Tragically, while she was away, her husband died suddenly of typhoid fever. Alice hurried back to Makarora to claim her inheritance, but left the two babies with her brother Sam and his wife (who were shortly to emigrate to New Zealand) and took only her eldest child, the illegitimate one, with her. This outraged her sisters-in-law, who saw it as an insult to their dead brother; they sent her away from the farm empty-handed. Once again she had to take a housekeeping job, this time in the North Island. In 1914, Alice and her brother�s family met up again, and Alice began a new life. (Fleur Adcock � abridged) The music of Alice is text-driven, ranging between a language at times extremely simple, as was the basic musical language of the settlers, and at times quite complex, evoking a storm at sea, or the unease of the settlers in a new environment, or Alice�s reaction to the problems which beset her. The piece is held together by various referential motifs. The initial idea, which perhaps suggests the instability of the sea, is also present in the bell-like sounds marking Charles� death, music associated with a storm at sea is later associated with mental stress, while music suggestive of the movement of shipboard lice later underlies Alice�s traumatic encounter with her sisters-in-law. There are eight sections, which often merge into one another: 1. in a letter to her father, Alice describes shipboard life; 2. in New Zealand, she compares her past life and hopes for the future; 3. a dialogue between father and daughter, expressed through their letters; 4. in Makarora, Alice discovers she is pregnant; 5. Alice hears of her father�s death; 6. in England, she learns of her husband�s death; 7. back in Makarora, Alice is turned away by her sisters-in-law; 8. turning her back on the South Island, Alice looks forward to her new life with her brother�s family in the north. While writing this piece, I was drawn again and again into the thought that, although this is a true story, set in a particular place at a certain time, it has the resonances of a universal myth, known to all of us who live here. Our forebears, or we ourselves, have crossed the seas to begin a new life, with unforeseen and unimaginable difficulties and felicities, whether ten years, a century or a millennium or so ago. "

Rotating on its tower to constantly face the prevailing breeze and responding to wind force by setting thresholds for propeller speed, the nacelle is the brains of the operation.  'Nacelle' continues my exploration of metric modulation and its relation to the movement and behaviour of machines, though with the added element of a soloist, who steers the music's path through different tempi as well as defining the direction of the music's texture and language; the soloist is the brains of the operation. Two cadenzas allow for an escape from the rigours of the metric scheme, where a subjective take on the timing of proceedings is permitted.  In 2003 I lived close to Wellington's wind turbine and indulged in regular walks to the landmark. �Nacelle� was performed in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland by 175 East in April and May of 2003 with solo clarinetist Gretchen Dunsmore."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In the middle of 2002, Tim Cummings, an American who had been living in New Zealand for some years, returned home and, with his friend Ringo, embarked on a road-trip from Florida to Los Angeles. Along the way he e-mailed his friends a series of haiku poems (sixteen in total) that related his coast-to-coast experiences of a land that, although his own, he had come to feel like a stranger in. From the lethargy and obesity of Florida's residents, to the disturbing cruelty of an animal park tour guide in Louisiana, to the beautiful but oppressive landscape of the desert, the depraved glitz of Las Vegas and the polluted haze hanging above Los Angeles, Tim's haiku, though necessarily brief, said much about the country from which Western popular culture draws so much.  I began the task of setting Tim's words to music as momentum was gathering for the American-lead war on Iraq. Articles in the New Zealand Listener and the writings of John Pilger, and others, on America's place in the world, informed much of how I perceived my texts and coloured my composition.  'Don't Mess With Texas' is a view - admittedly through a distant lense - of an essentially insular people, whose outward gestures, driven by self-interest and an unconscious belief in the superiority of their culture, often take on menacing forms. The many style quotations should not be interpreted as hammy representations of American stereotypes portrayed with music, but rather should reflect the sometimes dangerous consequences of unbridled patriotism and of ignorance of matters global. That said, 'Dont' Mess With Texas' deals not only with America's human population and alluded to socio-political-environmental matters, but with the beauty of its natural interior, where a redemptive musical language is able to emerge from the urban chaos. 'Don't Mess With Texas' is dedicated to Tim Cummings, the sort of open-eyed American the world needs more of. 'Don�t Mess With Texas' was premiered by gateseven in May 2003, conductor Ewan Clark, soprano soloist Madeleine Pierard."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: A Tone Poem for Symphony Orchestra. This work was composed as a millennial tribute to the great country of Canada. The piece is constructed around various traditional folk melodies. The main theme is based on \"Land of the Silver Birch\" and, symbolically, other themes come from \"I's the b'y that built the boat\", \"Freres Jaques\" and of course, a reference to the national anthems of France and England (distorted to reflect those cultures being modified to Canada's use). Within the tone-poem is an evocation of sunset on the prairies, a hoedown and a magnificent climax representing the Rocky Mountains and reflecting the optimism that should continue to be Canada's birthright.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The \"Great Harbour of Tara\" is a tone poem about Wellington. A conductor's score and fully edited parts are available. The work starts with atmosphere - waves lapping very gently on Petone beach and the tinkle of sand . The main theme sounds on the Fr. Horn then the music builds and eventually a reference is made to the old whaling days followed by a storm (a characteristic of Cook Strait - the infamous 'Southerly') building to hurricane force strength. The storm also alludes to the sinking of the Waihini in the '60s. An elegy for strings follows in honour of the victims of that disaster. The mood gradually changes to calm acceptance and on to an optimistic view of Wellington's future, a big, full tutti . The work closes with the atmosphere of sand, surf and evening. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This piece is essentially an extended fanfare. It opens with a single note gradually fanning out to a chord in the brass, and this idea returns at the climax of the piece. This material gives way to the first main melodic idea in the strings, against which the woodwind provide a repetitive and lively accompaniment. The middle section is softer and allows several of the woodwind instruments to take short solos against sustained string chords. A build up of energy leads back to the original brass idea, but this time set against insistent pitch in the woodwind and strings. The piece ends firmly in the tonic key of D major. �Piece in Celebration: Puke Ariki� was written for, and won first prize in, a competition organised by the New Plymouth Orchestra to mark the opening of the city�s new museum and library complex �Puke Ariki�.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: During the composition of 'Pivotal Orbits', I was influenced by the sensual imagery of the following passage in Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer:  The earth is not an arid plateau of health and comfort, but a great sprawling female with velvet torso that swells and heaves with ocean billows; she squirms beneath a diadem of sweat and anguish. Naked and sexed she rolls among the clouds in the violet light of the stars. All of her�blazes with furious ardour. She moves amongst the seasons and the years with a grand whoopla that seizes the torso with paroxysmal fury, that shakes the cobwebs out of the sky; she subsides on her pivotal orbits with volcanic tremors.  'Pivotal Orbits' is a portrayal of this tectonic restlessness and movement, existing in a lush sound environment, tied together by three recurring ideas that are in constant developmental flux. 'Pivotal Orbits' was premiered by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra (conductor Kazufumi Yamashita) at the Asian Music Festival, Tokyo, September 2003.  It has since been played in a SOUNZ/NZSO Readings, conductor Hamish McKeich."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The 'Love Sonnets of Michelangelo' I wrote for Michael Parmenter with whom I worked on a programme entitled �Between Two Fires�. (Also included was a dance-theatre work I created collaboratively with Michael, using his voice as well as his body, with imagery extracted from the diaries of Franz Kafka.) At the time I was focused on different styles of melody, having just completed my Five Melodies for Piano. Inspired by the lovely voices of some of the then current students in our School of Music, I felt that women�s voices gave the expressive quality I wanted, as well as providing a useful �cover� for the overtly homoerotic tenor of the texts. The original production used film, shot by my good friend Bayley Watson, showed the dancer�s prostrate figure, swathed in bandages. As the performance unfolded the cloth was gradually cut and pealed back by hands belonging to an old man whose face we never saw, the intended metaphor being of the sculptor cutting away marble to reveal the male form that he sensed already existed within the stone. The work has since had other performances that have discarded the theatrical elements, most successfully when each setting is prefaced by a reading of the poem in translation. One of the greatest artists of all time, Michelangelo was also an important poet. These settings of some of his most personal sonnets articulate the anguish of love and desire, as well as the despair of old age. The musical style combines the theatricality of Italian bel canto with the direct expressivity of folksong. Love Sonnets of Michelangelo was originally sung by Leslie Graham and Linden Loader and danced by Michael Parmenter."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Risky, perhaps, to create a set of 'Lullabies', if one wants to avoid sending an audience to sleep!  But a lullaby might not always be soporific, if we consider the state of mind of the singer, who may be singing as much for themselves, projecting onto the child their own anxieties, frustrations, aspirations, hopes. The musical language tries to suggest a folk-like simplicity; the invented languages likewise hinting at distant regions � no. I African perhaps? II Turkish? III Latinate? IV Pacific? In the final movement, the word �Calumbaya� is borrowed from the name of a Filipino friend�s barrio, a name so euphonious as to be irresistible.  Invariably, mature age is a time for surrendering to seductive nostalgia and sentimentality, the very things one had previously studiously avoided. But the challenge is to find true beauty in the banal, and mystery in common clich�, something I attempted in my several settings of old songs, remembering my dear, departed paternal grandmother, and also my hale and hearty 100 year-old father, whose musical tastes extend little further than old style tunes like these. Five Lullabies was composed in 1989 as a tribute to Peter Godfrey on his retirement, and was first performed in its entirety by the Tudor Consort. Musically, they were partly inspired by my discovery of the wonderful vocal polyphonies of some of China�s minority cultures, sometimes characterised by the so-called �dissonant� interval of a 2nd being held to resonate as a consonant.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: This piece was inspired by the famous Pink and White Terraces in New Zealand which were destroyed by the eruption of Mt Tarawera in 1886.  The Pink and White Terraces were huge naturally occuring staircases, created by deposits of silica in crystallised form over many centuries. People came from all over the world to view the terraces, described as the eighth wonder of the world.   According to legend, there was a premonition of the disaster in June, 1886.  While travelling across a lake near the terraces, some tourists and their Maori guide saw a mysterious canoe  of Maoris nearby.  They disappeared and were never seen again, and no reasonable explanation could be given for their existence.  However, some local Maori took this 'spirit-canoe' as an omen.  They were right. Before dawn the next day, Mt Tarawera erupted for five hours, destoying the Pink and White Terraces and killing 153 people.  It was New Zealand's worst volcanic disaster of recorded times.   This organ piece attempts to incorporate elements of the story into its musical gestures. The big opening chords describes the might and force of Mt Tarawera.  Then follow two quieter ideas, interrelated, which portray the gently bubbling beauty of the 'White Terrace' and then the 'Pink Terrace'. The eruption is heralded by low thundering trills on the pedals and sweeping upward runs on the keyboard.  The main theme that follows is toccato-like and conjures up visions of wild panic among the people.  This theme reappears on full organ at the climax, and the music gradually subsides.  The Tarawera chords from the beginning return like a solemn chorale for the dead, and the music drifts off into the distance, like smoke from the crater.   Pink and White was commissioned by Martin Setchell with funding from Creative New Zealand, and was composed especially for the new Christchurch Town Hall Rieger organ.  The composer is indebted to Martin Setchell for his advice and help with scoring for the organ. "

As a composer I wanted to make a small mark of respect to these greats with some dedications.  I have also taken a cue from Bach and Shostakovich and included contrapuntal forms within these preludes.  While not wanting to restrict myself to the form of a fugue, there are several preludes which are close in spirit to fugues:  Nos.17 and 19 for instance, are what I would call my 'prelugues'.  There is also a passacaglia (No.16) which owes a debt to Shostakovich.   I have conceived these pieces as a unified whole. Within them I have attempted to cover a whole variety of characters and moods, from the improvisational and experimental to the lyrical and gentle, from the wild and gestural to the calm and peaceful, from the quirky and 'black' to the light and sunny, from the depressive to the resolved.   The extensive technical planning and preparation behind these pieces has been fun for me as the composer, but in the end it is the sound and musical expression that matters.  I would like to think this voyage of discovery has led to something new and interesting to listen to. "

My title was partly motivated by the famous Handel precedent, but focuses on creatures that live in the sea. The first movement is titled 'Seahorses' and captures the gently undulating movements of these small creatures. More dramatic gestures suggest the ebb and flow of the sea. The second movement is titled 'Sting rays' and the music suggests the slowly flapping motion of the rays. In the third movement, 'Dolphins', the orchestra presents an energetic theme, and the movement is full of strong, upward sweeping gestures. A piccolo solo in the middle section derives from the opening, and portrays a baby dolphin. The work ends with a blow from the dolphin's spout. This 12 minute-commissioned work was first performed in 1994, and recorded for Concert FM under the baton of John Matheson. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Alegria' is an education piece for children of primary school age.  It focuses on aspects of rhythm and ostinato, and it is based on the flamenco principle of 3+3+2+2+2 (12 beat cycle).  Flamenco music is based on Spanish gypsy music, and is often accompanied by clapping, so there are clapping parts included for members of the orchestra.  The audience may learn the simple clapping patterns (on the next page), so they can accompany the orchestra when they hear the patterns.  The central section in 5/8 is intended as an asymmetrical contrast to the duple and triple meters of the outer sections. \"Alegria� means �joy� or �happiness� in Spanish. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Commissioned by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra to mark Tasmania's Bicentenary, 'River Mountain Sky' suggests an impression of the beautiful island that has been my home since 1998.  It celebrates a landscape of rivers and mountains, painted by orange and pink skies at dawn and dusk; a landscape crowned by dramatic cloud formations that give way to quiet nights when stars sparkle across a clear clean southern sky.  'River Mountain Sky' portrays mist over the estuary, sunshine dancing off a bright blue river and cascades of rushing water, yielding to darkness and the peace of evening."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Perhaps a little like objects in cyberspace, memories are simultaneously real while in another sense, imagined fabrications. Each of us has stored an incalculable number of memories that become distorted, fade over time, or are forgotten.  The questions of how real are memories and when do they exist or cease to exist has fascinated me for several years.   This work is intended to speak about forgotten memories, not only personal ones, but also the countless memories that have been lost or misplaced over the millennia of human existence.  There is a melody on the solo Viola that first appears two minutes into the work; it is reiterated twice, but is coloured by other sounds on each successive rendition � perhaps like the colouring of our memories."

The music aims to create a space in which the musicians, and the voices of their instruments, may speak together. The musical space is flexible, encouraging spontaneous dialogue between the various instrumental voices. Tawhirimatea, the wind god, child of Earth and Sky, represents powerful elemental forces, but he is also capable of gentle playfulness. Te hau refers also to human breath, the force which animates the wind instruments. From the mingling of breath, sweet voices are brought into being. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: During the composition of 'Pivotal Orbits', I was influenced by the sensual imagery of the following passage in Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer:  The earth is not an arid plateau of health and comfort, but a great sprawling female with velvet torso that swells and heaves with ocean billows; she squirms beneath a diadem of sweat and anguish. Naked and sexed she rolls among the clouds in the violet light of the stars. All of her�blazes with furious ardour. She moves amongst the seasons and the years with a grand whoopla that seizes the torso with paroxysmal fury, that shakes the cobwebs out of the sky; she subsides on her pivotal orbits with volcanic tremors.  'Pivotal Orbits' is a portrayal of this tectonic restlessness and movement, existing in a lush sound environment, tied together by three recurring ideas that are in constant developmental flux. 'Pivotal Orbits' was premiered by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra (conductor Kazufumi Yamashita) at the Asian Music Festival, Tokyo, September 2003.  It has since been played in a SOUNZ/NZSO Readings, conductor Hamish McKeich."

'River Mountain Sky' portrays mist over the estuary, sunshine dancing off a bright blue river and cascades of rushing water, yielding to darkness and the peace of evening."

Rotating on its tower to constantly face the prevailing breeze and responding to wind force by setting thresholds for propeller speed, the nacelle is the brains of the operation.  'Nacelle' continues my exploration of metric modulation and its relation to the movement and behaviour of machines, though with the added element of a soloist, who steers the music's path through different tempi as well as defining the direction of the music's texture and language; the soloist is the brains of the operation. Two cadenzas allow for an escape from the rigours of the metric scheme, where a subjective take on the timing of proceedings is permitted.  In 2003 I lived close to Wellington's wind turbine and indulged in regular walks to the landmark. �Nacelle� was performed in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland by 175 East in April and May of 2003 with solo clarinetist Gretchen Dunsmore."

  general_note: "Keay: Nigel Keay; CD"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: The composition of the 'Serenade for Strings' was undertaken from 2001 and this work succeeds Nigel Keay's 'Viola Concerto'. The 'Serenade' is a four movement work of around 17 minutes duration in an essentially lyrical style. The initial inspiration for the 'Serenade for String Orchestra' came from being involved as a violist in a string orchestra in Caen, Lower Normandy, which was assembling a programme of String Serenades. 'Serenade for Strings' is dedicated to Val�rie Baisn�e who played violin in this group. From June 2001, work continued on the second movement in Paris and the writing was eventually finished in 2002. The first movement ('Moderato') starts very simply, which represents a tabula rasa where the lines accumulate one by one to construct the harmony, a detachment from what had been the heavy task of writing the 'Viola Concerto'. 'Serenade for Strings' starts from nothing to create new harmonies. Concerning the idea of the serenade, today a very imprecise musical form, the idea of the evening or night is kept through using a musical language that is quite dark. The first movement is based on a short, recurring chromatic melody constructed of quavers, but which is surrounded by a more and more elaborate variation of the background material. The second movement ('Allegro') is constructed on a kind of moto perpetuo texture long interwoven lines, which evolve into increasingly ornamented and elaborate melodies. The third movement ('Adagietto') is the darkest movement, marked by an often low orchestral tessitura. The bare melodies create the most desperate and tender moments of this work. The fourth movement ('Vivo') makes a lively contrast to the third with an optimistic opening. Melodic motives are tossed around the orchestra as in a game. But towards the end the nostalgic themes of the first movement are recalled. � Comme tu me plairais, � nuit ! sans ces �toiles Dont la lumi�re parle un langage connu ! Car je cherche le vide, et le noir, et le nu ! � Baudelaire   'Obsession'"

  general_note: "Keay: Nigel Keay; CD"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Terrestrial Mirror' was written in 2004 and is a contemplation on the idea of voyage and discovery, in both the physical and musical worlds. Now residing in Western Europe and being originally from New Zealand, the voyage to the antipodes has become a regular occurrence for me. The title �Terrestrial Mirror\" refers to the Pacific Ocean, in fact a phrase coined by the New Zealand author Michael King, where he suggests that the Pacific Ocean with its scattered islands is somewhat of a reflection of the night sky. Each return to the Pacific evokes a contemplation of the multiple discoveries of New Zealand, first by Polynesian then European navigators. The choice of a work for Flute, Viola & Harp grew out of working with Eric Kohenoff & Alix Couillaud on Debussy�s Sonata, and Jeffrey Harrington's Oneiromancer along with other repertoire of this instrumentation. In 'Terrestrial Mirror' the flute represents the sky and wind, the viola represents the sea, and the third instrument, the harp represents the land. The analogy in the instrumentation is of course the flute often soaring in the higher registers with the viola providing a sinuous and cohesive thread of mobile tonality as opposed to the relatively more constrained tonal shifts of the harp due to its diatonic-based construction. The number three is also symbolic with its connection to navigation (triangulation). The programme of the voyage of discovery is as follows: the first movement symbolizes embarkation, initial excitement, determination, anticipation, progressive nostalgia. The second and most interiorised movement, which is really the heart of the work, represents dislocation, introspection, doubt, desperation, and the third movement represents discovery, arrival, celebration etc."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Tango Suite' was commissioned by Radio France in July 2002 and completed in October of the same year. Written immediately after 'Serenade for Strings', 'Tango Suite' also employs a string ensemble but with a contralto voice added. The commission for Alla Br�ve determined that the group would be relatively small, however the double bass gives a very deep and solid character to the music. From about 1995 Nigel Keay had been writing a very \"deep-toned\" music, and this is reflected in the Viola Concerto of 2000 in which he uses a contrabassoon in a chamber orchestra, often taking the instrument down to the bottom of its range. This idea is extended and the instrumentation of string quintet (standard string quartet + double-bass) is used in 'Tango Suite'.  The five pieces, are strongly influenced by the traditional roots of Argentinean tango. As there were four forms to be considered (tango, milonga, candombe, valse), Tango Suite is a work composed close to the true spirit of tango, but in the context of a personal musical language. The pieces of the 'Suite' differ not only through the forms that they use, or are inspired by, but also by their tempi. 1. \"TANGO\", a tango, is the slowest of the suite. The initial resolve of chord/key at the beginning, takes the seemingly dark and foreboding start into a light and warmth. With statement and answer interplay between the voice and strings parts. 2. \"POEMAS DE AMOR\", a kind of neo-romantic tango which has the fastest tempo. This song contains lovingly blended string writing and an open airy breathable style, both intense and placid at once. A gentle song buoyed by its accompaniment, 3. \"CAPRICHO\" is a milonga with a moderate pace. It's perhaps the most undemanding of the cycle for the listener with a simple happy feel and lilting tempo. 4. \"VIDA\" tends toward a slightly brisker tempo with a more percussive style texture. An open easy-going song. 5. \"T�, QUE NUNCA SER�S...\" is in 3/4 (Tempo di valse) but often employs rhythmic devices such as hemiola, cross-rhythm and syncopation. Varied within itself, the song opens out in the middle, to give an open charm with a solid rhythmic character."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Hinetekakara is the ancestress of Aroha Yates-Smith, the kaikaranga (singer) who provided the idea and the text of this piece. Hinetekakara lived on the shores of Lake Rotorua with Ihenga, her husband or father, an eponymous ancestor of the Te Arawa people, when the land was still being settled after the arrival of the Te Arawa canoe from central Polynesia.   The four cadenzas, for bassoon, alto flute, flute, cello and bassoon, and bassoon link improvised sections, in which all the instruments participate. The singer initially invokes, accompanied by putatara (conch shell trumpet), the spirit of Hinetekakara, then addresses rituals following the death of her future father-in-law (with putorino), and then the birth of her son (with pumotomoto, an instrument used to assist at child-birth). A voiceless improvisation on pupu harakeke (flax snail), an instrument presaging danger, is followed by Ihenga's anguished lament as he finds the murdered body of Hinetekakara by the lake, by the place named for her, Ohinemutu, meaning the end of the woman. Finally, she is farewelled as her spirit returns to the afterworld. "

  general_note: "Gillian Whitehead: CD2; CD"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: In his 1974 collection 'The lives of a Cell', Lewis Thomas wrote a memorable essay devoted to the spectrum of sound made by all living creatures. He believes that as well as producing sounds in every possible way to send messages to their own kind, all creatures have the urge to make some kind of music. The rhythmic sounds         emitted by all creatures might, Lewis suggests �be the recapitulation of something else - an earliest memory, a score for the transformation of inanimate random matter in chaos into the improbable ordered dance of living forms.� It was this essay, together with my fascination in the rediscovery of the part of Auckland I knew as a young child, that have shaped this piece. The basis of the piece is the twelve possible three-note groups which function to form molecular structures - harmonic, textural, gestural, melodic - some simple, some complex, often symmetrical.  The piece could be regarded as part of a classical tradition, in that it focuses primarily on balance of pitch and orchestration rather than on gesture or programmatic elements, and places the instrumental writing well within the range of the instruments rather than exploiting their extremes.  'The improbable ordered dance ----' is in a single movement and begins with a ghostly chant-like melody over a drone; this recurs in different forms several times during the piece. A transition section based on transformed sounds of nocturnal birds leads to a metrically free 'dawn chorus'. The following chorale-like passages and the rapid sections that follow are part of a restless upward-moving continuum which can never settle nor ever finish. The later sections of the piece recycle, combine and finally dissipate the earlier material."

Arapatiki translates (from the Maori language) as 'the way of the flounder', and is the ancient name  of the sand flats in front of my house at Harwood, near Dunedin. The piece has something to do with the advance and retreat of the tide across the flats, where many species of sea and water birds spend much of the day - an ever-varying water-scape. The opening idea is based on the song of the korimako or bellbird. "

The title is taken from an essay by Fran�ois Bayle, which discusses the phenomenology of musical experience in richly poetic language. While not to be taken literally, this phrase reflects the play of energies in the music, and the transfer of energy between different regions, an evanescent surface, subject to unseen subterranean forces."

Naked and sexed she rolls among the clouds in the violet light of the stars. All of her�blazes with furious ardour. She moves amongst the seasons and the years with a grand whoopla that seizes the torso with paroxysmal fury, that shakes the cobwebs out of the sky; she subsides on her pivotal orbits with volcanic tremors.  'Pivotal Orbits' is a portrayal of this tectonic restlessness and movement, existing in a lush sound environment, tied together by three recurring ideas that are in constant developmental flux. 'Pivotal Orbits' was premiered by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra (conductor Kazufumi Yamashita) at the Asian Music Festival, Tokyo, September 2003.  It has since been played in a SOUNZ/NZSO Readings, conductor Hamish McKeich."

  general_note: "NZ Women Composers Vol.2; CD"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: In contrast to the singular, organic process of solo for cello this piece plays with the idea of juxtaposing contrasting fragments of material. It was stimulated by a book of dream symbols, in the form of simple gouache paintings, originating in the Rajasthan Gujarat area of Western India in the early 19th century.  The book is one of any number of dream lexicons to be found in ancient eastern cultures that guided the interpretation of dreams using mythological and cultural symbols pertaining to fortune and destiny. Although the Rajasthan Gujarat lexicon informs aspects of the aesthetic of the piece, it is not intended that the music function as an illustration of the visual images themselves.  Rather: whereas the pictures seek to make concrete the ephemeral matter of the dream, the music embodies an attempt both to restore the subjective nature of the dreamscape and to reconstruct the grammar of its articulation in time - concentrated, disjunct and fleeting. This occurs perhaps in the way that one might attempt to reconstruct a paragraph in an archaic language from its written symbols, without having access to their original source or context, guided only by intuitions based on experience of one's own language - in this case the 'language' of the dream. The title of the piece is borrowed from one of the images of the Rajasthan Gujarat lexicon. Water Mountain was composed for Apartment House 1999. It has been performed in Reading, New Zealand (175E ensemble 2002), Seoul (ACL festival 2003) and Brighton (Soundwaves festival, 2007) and broadcast by Radio NZ."

Each of us has stored an incalculable number of memories that become distorted, fade over time, or are forgotten.  The questions of how real are memories and when do they exist or cease to exist has fascinated me for several years.   This work is intended to speak about forgotten memories, not only personal ones, but also the countless memories that have been lost or misplaced over the millennia of human existence.  There is a melody on the solo Viola that first appears two minutes into the work; it is reiterated twice, but is coloured by other sounds on each successive rendition � perhaps like the colouring of our memories."

The chorale-like theme that emerges towards the end is based on my \"Te Puna Waiora\" (Spring of Living Water). Overall, \"Otari\" is shaped by some words in T.S. Eliot�s \"Four Quartets\":   \" At the still point, there the dance is..\" This work is dedicated to Carolyn Mills, principal harpist for the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, whose innovative and enthusiastic collaboration enabled me to explore some extended harp techniques as part of the composing process. In March 2005, \"Otari\" was premiered in U.S.A. and since then it has received several performances in New Zealand and theUnites States as well as at three international Harp Festivals -London, San Francisco and Adelaide."

The Symphony follows the emotional shape of the song-cycle, moving from struggle and resistance towards acceptance. The first movement is the most substantial, and near the beginning introduces a three-note figure (on horns and trumpet), which permeates the whole work. The three final movements - scherzo, slow march and epilogue - are played without a break."

The piece is constructed around various traditional folk melodies. The main theme is based on \"Land of the Silver Birch\" and, symbolically, other themes come from \"I's the b'y that built the boat\", \"Freres Jaques\" and of course, a reference to the national anthems of France and England (distorted to reflect those cultures being modified to Canada's use). Within the tone-poem is an evocation of sunset on the prairies, a hoedown and a magnificent climax representing the Rocky Mountains and reflecting the optimism that should continue to be Canada's birthright.

  general_note: "Keay: Serenade for Strings; CD"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: The composition of the 'Serenade for Strings' was undertaken from 2001 and this work succeeds Nigel Keay's 'Viola Concerto'. The 'Serenade' is a four movement work of around 17 minutes duration in an essentially lyrical style. The initial inspiration for the 'Serenade for String Orchestra' came from being involved as a violist in a string orchestra in Caen, Lower Normandy, which was assembling a programme of String Serenades. 'Serenade for Strings' is dedicated to Val�rie Baisn�e who played violin in this group. From June 2001, work continued on the second movement in Paris and the writing was eventually finished in 2002. The first movement ('Moderato') starts very simply, which represents a tabula rasa where the lines accumulate one by one to construct the harmony, a detachment from what had been the heavy task of writing the 'Viola Concerto'. 'Serenade for Strings' starts from nothing to create new harmonies. Concerning the idea of the serenade, today a very imprecise musical form, the idea of the evening or night is kept through using a musical language that is quite dark. The first movement is based on a short, recurring chromatic melody constructed of quavers, but which is surrounded by a more and more elaborate variation of the background material. The second movement ('Allegro') is constructed on a kind of moto perpetuo texture long interwoven lines, which evolve into increasingly ornamented and elaborate melodies. The third movement ('Adagietto') is the darkest movement, marked by an often low orchestral tessitura. The bare melodies create the most desperate and tender moments of this work. The fourth movement ('Vivo') makes a lively contrast to the third with an optimistic opening. Melodic motives are tossed around the orchestra as in a game. But towards the end the nostalgic themes of the first movement are recalled. � Comme tu me plairais, � nuit ! sans ces �toiles Dont la lumi�re parle un langage connu ! Car je cherche le vide, et le noir, et le nu ! � Baudelaire   'Obsession'"

  internal_note: "Programme Note: During the composition of 'Pivotal Orbits', I was influenced by the sensual imagery of the following passage in Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer:  The earth is not an arid plateau of health and comfort, but a great sprawling female with velvet torso that swells and heaves with ocean billows; she squirms beneath a diadem of sweat and anguish. Naked and sexed she rolls among the clouds in the violet light of the stars. All of her�blazes with furious ardour. She moves amongst the seasons and the years with a grand whoopla that seizes the torso with paroxysmal fury, that shakes the cobwebs out of the sky; she subsides on her pivotal orbits with volcanic tremors.  'Pivotal Orbits' is a portrayal of this tectonic restlessness and movement, existing in a lush sound environment, tied together by three recurring ideas that are in constant developmental flux. 'Pivotal Orbits' was premiered by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra (conductor Kazufumi Yamashita) at the Asian Music Festival, Tokyo, September 2003.  It has since been played in a SOUNZ/NZSO Readings, conductor Hamish McKeich."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: My first experiences of the soundworlds of Mahler's late orchestral works revealed to me the vast distances over which late romantic harmonic language can transport the listener. I was instantly taken by the immense power generated by Mahler's continual re-casting of the opening melodies of the Ninth (last mvt) and Tenth (first mvt) Symphonies, in subtlely or radically new harmonic and orchestrational contexts. One waits in expectation of the return of the opening and, no matter whether it's the first or the fiftieth hearing, is stunned by the genius of the new twist applied. 'Aufsatz' (German for \"essay\") is my attempt at capturing - in some very small way - the gist of Mahler's regenerative methods. The piece is a lopsided sonata form, where an angular development is followed by a vastly expanded recapitulation, which culminates in a perpetual re-spinning of the opening material, cut short by a brief and optimistic coda. 'Aufsatz' is dedicated to my piano teacher from an early age, Margaret Carryer. Read by the NZSO in November 2003, with a further �broadcast standard� reading in 2006.  Hamish McKeich conducted on both occasions."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Nga ha o nehera', which translates from the Maori language as 'a breath from the past', was commissioned by and written for Ben Hoadley, with financial assistance from the Becroft Trust. Ben Hoadley gave the piece its first performance at the International Double Reed Convention in Melbourne in 2004.  'Nga ha o nehera' is a five-movement suite, written after  a taonga puoro wananga at Ohinemutu on the shores of Lake Rotorua.  The first movement is 'Nga ha o nehera', meaning a breath from the past, the second, 'puna wera', describes the continual welling up of hot water from a spring at the edge of the lake, and the third, 'Mokoia', suggests the soundscape of Mokoia Island, which, as well as a major historical site, is also a bird sanctuary.  The fourth movement He purakau, recounts a folk-story - not a specific tale, but suggesting the  elements of all strong stories, and the last movement, 'Ohinemutu', locates the piece in place, and suggests something of the story of Hinetekakara, the ancestress of the Te Arawa people, whose untimely death gave the place its name.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In the tradition of the Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, Hine Raukatauri is the goddess of music and dance. She is embodied in the form of the female case-moth, who hangs in the bushes and sings in a pure, high voice to attract the male moths to her.  Her hair is found as a fern, the hanging spleenwort, and her voice is heard in the sound of the putorino, an instrument known only in Aotearoa (the Maori name for New Zealand). The putorino is an instrument that can be played in various ways � as a flute, as a trumpet and as a means of enhancing or altering the human voice. 'Hine Raukatauri' is written for two performers, one playing conventional flutes (piccolo, C and alto flutes), and the other for taonga puoro (instruments). The score features three different putorino, which, like all taonga puoro, (and also the songs and chants) have a small pitch range, rarely exceeding a fourth, which varies from instrument to instrument. Three putorino are used in this piece � one made of albatross bone and two of wood, and both the flute and trumpet voices are used. Other instruments used are a karanga manu (bird-caller), a purerehua (swung bull-roarer) and tumutumu (tapped instruments.)  The flute player�s part is notated, but the music for the taonga puoro is improvised; there are areas when the flute player is encouraged to improvise with the taonga."

'Taurangi' was commissioned by the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts, during which it received its first performance by Bridget Douglas and Rachel Thompson, in March, 2000."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Hinetekakara is the ancestress of Aroha Yates-Smith, the kaikaranga (singer) who provided the idea and the text of this piece. Hinetekakara lived on the shores of Lake Rotorua with Ihenga, her husband or father, an eponymous ancestor of the Te Arawa people, when the land was still being settled after the arrival of the Te Arawa canoe from central Polynesia.   The four cadenzas, for bassoon, alto flute, flute, cello and bassoon, and bassoon link improvised sections, in which all the instruments participate. The singer initially invokes, accompanied by putatara (conch shell trumpet), the spirit of Hinetekakara, then addresses rituals following the death of her future father-in-law (with putorino), and then the birth of her son (with pumotomoto, an instrument used to assist at child-birth). A voiceless improvisation on pupu harakeke (flax snail), an instrument presaging danger, is followed by Ihenga's anguished lament as he finds the murdered body of Hinetekakara by the lake, by the place named for her, Ohinemutu, meaning the end of the woman. Finally, she is farewelled as her spirit returns to the afterworld. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: As conceived by Peter Schat, the Tone Clock is a formalization of the observation that, within the twelve-note chromatic system, there are twelve possible triads (i.e. groups of three notes, differentiated by the size of the intervals between them - the classical major and minor triads being two of the twelve), and that each of these triads may be transposed three times to give all twelve notes of the chromatic scale, without repetitions. Schat likened the twelve different triads, and their characteristic sonorities, to the twelve hours shown on a clock face, hence the name. McLeod saw in this an effective method for describing harmonic fields in any music using the chromatic system, and found that it helped explain choices she had made unconsciously in her own compositions. She expanded Schat�s system beyond the triads, to take into account every possible combination of intervals in all possible sizes of note groups. These piano pieces were the first works McLeod wrote after investigating the Tone Clock, and she achieved with them an unusually high level of personal expression. The first piece was written for David Farquhar�s sixtieth birthday, and the fifth for Olivier Messiaen�s eightieth birthday. Interestingly, the third piece is based entirely upon the harmonic movements in the first prelude in Bach�s Well-tempered Clavier, when applied to the extended harmonic world of the Tone Clock.  (Note: Mark Jones)."

Tawhirimatea, the wind god, child of Earth and Sky, represents powerful elemental forces, but he is also capable of gentle playfulness. Te hau refers also to human breath, the force which animates the wind instruments. From the mingling of breath, sweet voices are brought into being. "

Rotating on its tower to constantly face the prevailing breeze and responding to wind force by setting thresholds for propeller speed, the nacelle is the brains of the operation.  'Nacelle' continues my exploration of metric modulation and its relation to the movement and behaviour of machines, though with the added element of a soloist, who steers the music's path through different tempi as well as defining the direction of the music's texture and language; the soloist is the brains of the operation. Two cadenzas allow for an escape from the rigours of the metric scheme, where a subjective take on the timing of proceedings is permitted.  In 2003 I lived close to Wellington's wind turbine and indulged in regular walks to the landmark. �Nacelle� was performed in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland by 175 East in April and May of 2003 with solo clarinetist Gretchen Dunsmore."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In the middle of 2002, Tim Cummings, an American who had been living in New Zealand for some years, returned home and, with his friend Ringo, embarked on a road-trip from Florida to Los Angeles. Along the way he e-mailed his friends a series of haiku poems (sixteen in total) that related his coast-to-coast experiences of a land that, although his own, he had come to feel like a stranger in. From the lethargy and obesity of Florida's residents, to the disturbing cruelty of an animal park tour guide in Louisiana, to the beautiful but oppressive landscape of the desert, the depraved glitz of Las Vegas and the polluted haze hanging above Los Angeles, Tim's haiku, though necessarily brief, said much about the country from which Western popular culture draws so much.  I began the task of setting Tim's words to music as momentum was gathering for the American-lead war on Iraq. Articles in the New Zealand Listener and the writings of John Pilger, and others, on America's place in the world, informed much of how I perceived my texts and coloured my composition.  'Don't Mess With Texas' is a view - admittedly through a distant lense - of an essentially insular people, whose outward gestures, driven by self-interest and an unconscious belief in the superiority of their culture, often take on menacing forms. The many style quotations should not be interpreted as hammy representations of American stereotypes portrayed with music, but rather should reflect the sometimes dangerous consequences of unbridled patriotism and of ignorance of matters global. That said, 'Dont' Mess With Texas' deals not only with America's human population and alluded to socio-political-environmental matters, but with the beauty of its natural interior, where a redemptive musical language is able to emerge from the urban chaos. 'Don't Mess With Texas' is dedicated to Tim Cummings, the sort of open-eyed American the world needs more of. 'Don�t Mess With Texas' was premiered by gateseven in May 2003, conductor Ewan Clark, soprano soloist Madeleine Pierard."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The flax plant, and a cluster of related images, stand behind this piece. While not directly pictorial, it suggests flickering, swaying movement, and a fascination with dry, rustling sounds. These sounds and movements are not self-sustaining, but set in motion by the agency of air, of wind and, in this case, of human breath. These activating forces suggest echoes of the environments in which the plant grows. On another level of human agency, the place of flax as a raw material for intricately woven objects also intersects with the music. The piece is concerned with the relationship between the flute as an acoustical system and the human gestures by which its sounds are produced. The flute�s capacity for timbral modification, for the simultaneous manipulation of multiple aspects of the sound production, would seem to invite a sonically directed musical form. This approach encourages the instrument into unstable behaviours, as different, and sometimes conflicting performance gestures are superimposed, or placed in quick succession. I am deeply grateful to Bridget Douglas for her close collaboration in the making of the piece."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: I began writing this piece in the shadow of both the East Timor crisis and the death of my good friend and sometime mentor of many years, the musicologist and historian John Mansfield Thomson. These events modified both the original formal ideas and the detail of the piece. William's 'A Dictionary of the Maori Language' gives four meanings for taurangi: �unsettled�, �changing or changeable�; �incomplete, unsatisfied, unfulfilled�; 'to grieve for'; and �wanderer�. 'Taurangi' was commissioned by the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts, during which it received its first performance by Bridget Douglas and Rachel Thompson, in March, 2000."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Badb (pronounced �badhv� where �dh� is a voiced fricative, as in �these�) was one of a trio of war-goddesses from Irish legend. She assumed variously the guises of  a beautiful woman, an old hag, and a carrion crow. Her manifestation in the latter form was an omen of death. Before a battle she would appear in anticipation  of the carnage, and as the battle took place, would flit around the heads of the warriors. Afterwards, she would feed on the corpses strewn across the fields. Like  the other two battle-furies, Macha and the M�rr�gan, Badb was both sinister and sexual; she prophesied the end of the world, the fall of the gods and an endless  reign of chaos.  There are three distinct types of material in this piece, portraying the three juxtaposed personalities of Badb: the sinuous, seductive syrensong of sing-flute  representing the mysterious, beautiful femme fatale who befriended the Irish warrior C� Chulainn, then lured him to his death; the unearthly shrieks and  battle-cries of the old hag, which were said to arouse fear and dread in the living; and the hideous crow, pecking at the flesh of the slain with bloodied maw.  Much of the piano�s harmonic structure is derived and interpolated from chords representing the crow in Olivier Messiaen�s 'Catalogue d�Oiseaux', while the notes  B, A and D feature prominently through the piece.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The cycle was originally composed for baritone and piano.  Yet as one hears in the first song, Harry sings to �an old guitar�.  In the piano version, Lilburn incorporates idiomatic guitar gestures into accompaniment throughout:  strumming, broken chords, and fading guitar snaps.  These serve not only to evoke the guitar, but also to strengthen one�s sense of the songs as self-reflective, self-accompanied cycle of �songs within songs�.  Lilburn subsequently arranged the cycle for tenor and guitar (1953, SLD-47), and for tenor and piano(1954, EC-26). "

  general_note: "Waiteata Collection of NZ Music, Volume IX; WTA 009"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: Lilburn composed these songs in 1958 for the baritone Donald Munro and his wife the violist Jean McCartney, who gave the first broadcast performance.  The influence of serialism on the composer�s style at this point in his career makes for a challenging vocal line, especially in the first two songs.  Nonetheless, Lilburn�s work capitalizes on the affinities between voice and viola, and exploits technical capabilities of the viola to evoke moods rather than painting the words.  In the penultimate verse of �Warning of Winter�, for example, the viola�s wavering line, thickened with chords, heralds the darkness of winter that �descends the flowered pathway�.  Such subtle evocation of the text is also found in �Blow, Wind of Fruitfulness�.  Here the viola�s wide leaps to high trills are to be executed with the bow placed over the fingerboard; this evokes the troubling paradoxes of spring, the �Birds that are silent now/And buds of barren springing�.  Between these bleak poles, the viola and voice pairing are used with bold irony in �Song of Allegiance�.  This march is a poet�s humble yet robust reflection on his own position in comparison to the poetic geniuses of the past.  Again Lilburn enlists the viola to speak with and as the poet: wide intervals, tense chords, and motivic stutters convey a poetic voice that is �cracked and harsh�."

  general_note: "Waiteata Collection of NZ Music, Volume IX; WTA 009"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: Curnow requested this work from Lilburn in 1952 for a poetry reading at Auckland University College.  The event took place on the evening of 9 August that year, and involved a substantial amount of poetry (twenty-two poems in total) read by the poets involved.  (Actually the works of eight poets were represented:  Baxter read �Canto at Twenty-seven� by Louis Johnson).  Lilburn�s music was premiered by Antonia Braidwood (violin) and Donald Bowick (piano).  One movement was supposed to precede each reading, providing the audience with the composer�s musical impressions of the work and personality of each poet.  In the event, however, the order was reversed, which led to some confusion for the audience and some displeasure for the composer.  Typical of New Zealand composition of the time, there was no fee to be had for the work.  Lilburn even had to pay his way to Auckland for the rehearsals.   On his return to Wellington, Lilburn shelved and forgot about the work.  It was not until a chance meeting at his doctor's surgery in 1988/89 that he was reminded of its existence by Lady Dorothia Turner, who had reviewed the first performance.  At that point Lilburn contacted the violinist Dean Major to ask if he would be interested in performing it.  After some negotiation the composer also determined that he would write a narration to go along with the music in lieu of the twenty-two poems, and (most surprisingly) volunteered to read this himself.   Salutes to Seven Poets was recorded by Concert FM on 5 September 1989, by Major (violin), with Rae de Lisle (piano). As if to make up for thirty-eight years of neglect of the work, this recording received a Mobil Award in 1990. (Note by Nancy November)."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: �The three poems here set have always seemed to me to share some ambient and most poignant awareness of our experience on these islands, whether of small remote sounds in summer, the desolation of a crippled gull, or the brilliance of summer harvesting, or whatever might make us feel at home�  �Douglas Lilburn  Lilburn found an underlying experiential similarity in these poems by Ruth Dallas (Nos. 1 and 2) and Basil Dowling (No. 3), which he drew the fore in his settings.  The keyboard introduction of �Clear Sky� captures the play of expansiveness (in the broad registral reach) and homeliness (the repeated motifs) that characterises the set as a whole.  In �The Picnic� the spacious quality of the keyboard, evoking the circling swallows in their easy flight, is tinged by a haunting iambic limp.  Lilburn�s word painting here is poignant and ironic:  vocal melismas depict the crumpled, curled foot of the one-footed gull, and our (short?) memories of his sorry sight.  �Summer Afternoon� sums up the ambivalent mood of the set.  The declamatory voice (also found in �The Picnic�) gradually becomes more lyrical, and a sense of progress is conveyed through the rising vocal line (as in �Clear Sky�).  Yet there is a lingering sadness.  The keyboard�s recurrent fluttering seventh and off-beat falling fourth recalls the desolation and troubling limp of �The Picnic�.  (Note by Nancy November)."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: �Sings Harry�, a setting of six poems by Denis Glover, tells of an endearingly idiosyncratic New Zealander.  It is a prime example of Lilburn�s subtle handling of poetic texts.  The self-reflective tone of the protagonist, and the slightly complex narrative mode, are established in the first song:  it is Harry�s voice that we hear, Harry singing his home-made song cycle; yet a guiding narrator is ever present to tells us so.  One�s awareness of this narrative voice is enhanced throughout the cycle by the recurrent falling-third motif at the phrase �sings Harry�, and by the composer�s frequent use of a vocal reciting tone or a pitch to which the voice is drawn.  It is nonetheless easy to become absorbed in the various voices of Harry, which range from the crusty critic to the carefree swaggerer.  Lilburn captures the fluctuating temporality and unpredictability of his subject with great sensitivity and humour.  In the final song, a delightful recollective melange of landscapes and uncles, this is achieved by means of recurrent motifs (the �river running by�) and reflective pauses.    �Sings Harry� was released in 1960 on a label called Kiwi New Zealand Composer Edition.  It was the third work by Lilburn to be recorded and the sole piece on a 45 rpm disc. Programme note: Nancy November"

Encountering these sculptures in the British Museum for the first time, I was intrigued to learn that one of the decorative motifs adorning its carved stone form was known as �egg and tongue�. The sensuously rounded forms of eggs and tongues alternate and repeat along the borders of the monumental sculptures, an ancient pattern combining symbols of virility and fertility. The motif is widespread: several years later, walking through the ruined architecture of the Syrian city of Apamea, I found tumbled-down stones of Roman structures bearing this same pattern, rain-washed stones in a field of crocuses.  In the music of �Egg and Tongue�, I play with ideas of patterning and fragmentation, cultural property and style. Familiar motifs repeat, adorn, are lost and take new shapes."

It is the green-eyed monster; cruelly aye it doth mock the meat it feeds on, and with its poison doth change our nature.� 2. A dislocated groove repeatedly interrupts  a seduction in the 'Earth, Wind and Fire' song Can�t Hide Love. 3. Trellis: what my sweet peas climb up each summer. It's loosely woven together from strips of wood - named after the light-textured Roman fabric trilicius, �woven with three threads�."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The �Elgin Marbles�, taken from the Parthenon, lie at the centre of a long-standing property dispute between Greece and the British Government. Encountering these sculptures in the British Museum for the first time, I was intrigued to learn that one of the decorative motifs adorning its carved stone form was known as �egg and tongue�. The sensuously rounded forms of eggs and tongues alternate and repeat along the borders of the monumental sculptures, an ancient pattern combining symbols of virility and fertility. The motif is widespread: several years later, walking through the ruined architecture of the Syrian city of Apamea, I found tumbled-down stones of Roman structures bearing this same pattern, rain-washed stones in a field of crocuses.  In the music of �Egg and Tongue�, I play with ideas of patterning and fragmentation, cultural property and style. Familiar motifs repeat, adorn, are lost and take new shapes."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Bright Silence', for solo violin, is an evocation of Central Otago, the high plateau between the Southern Alps and the coastal plains in the South Island of New Zealand. The area is treeless, rocky, sparsely populated, and the piece reflects the sounds, silences and ghosts of the area.  'Bright Silence' was written while Gillian Whitehead was composer-in-residence with the Auckland Philharmonia, as the competition piece for the inaugural Michael Hill World Violin Competition, held at Queenstown, New Zealand, where it received its first eighteen performances in June 2001. The piece is dedicated to Michael Hill."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In 1990 I attended the launch of Cilla McQueen's new book 'Berlin Diary'.  This diary made a big impression on me, initially because it brought back memories of my own trip to Europe.  I also liked the brilliant mixing of poetic and prosaic styles, and the vivid descriptions of people and places.  Something else that imprsssed me was the strong contrast between the inhuman political situation in Berlin (the wall was still up) and the natural, peaceful beauty of Dunedin, New Zealand. (Cilla's and my own home town).  A few months later the Aramoana tragedy (where a deranged gunman killed 13 people - Aramoana is a remote seaside township at the end of the Otago peninsula) changed that around.  Cilla's beautiful, almost ecstatic centrepiece in the dairy \"O Aramoana\" now took on a terrible subtext, and it seemed as if the inhumanity of Berlin had come to the remote beach community.  A year later, the Berlin wall finally came down, and the unification of East and West Germany became a reality.  When Judy Bellingham approached me in 1991 to write a song cycle for her, I immediately wanted to set extracts from the 'Berlin Diary', to capture these layers of dramatic historical irony along with the essence of a marvellous text.   In reality I was able to only set a fraction of the diary to music, and hence the title of my work - 'Berlin Fragments' (which I would also like to think suggests the breaking of the Berlin wall into bits).  After talking to Cilla about the work, I decided to make \"O Aramoana\" the heart of the work, around which somewhat shorter texts are clustered.  Sections are often linked by a recurrent chord in the bottom of the piano (the dyad E-F), which I have imagined as a tombstone in musical terms.  Framing the work are brief sections which convey the flight to and from Berlin (the \"green below\" being an unmistakeable reference to a return to New Zealand).  The 23 minutes of this song cycle run continuously. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In composing this concerto I recognise two contrasting musical cultures within the European artistic tradition. The Brass Band represents what I call a 'closed' musical system portrayed by its standardised instrumentation heard to great effect in its stirring marches, sonorous hymn playing, contest pieces and arrangements of popular and show music,  while the orchestra  with its dazzling array of many instrumental colours, its flexible instrumentation and its potential for pushing musical boundaries, represents an 'open' musical system.   I wanted also to exploit the virtuosic capacity of the brass band as a concerto soloist and to celebrate through this work the unity and solidarity amongst brass musicians. 'Europa' is a one movement work in five main sections which alternate slow atmospheric music with a fast and rhythmic style. The latter is heard in the many rapid passages which switch from band to orchestra and vice versa. Noteable also is the relationship between the band and the orchesta particularly in the cadenzas for the brass band followed by the orchestral brass. I was spurred into composing this work after reading about Europa, one of the large moons of the planet Jupiter first seen by Galileo in 1610 and named after a goddess of Greek mythology. Such thoughts were instrumental in generating my first musical ideas, for instance the name 'Europa' is represented by a six note melody heard throughout the work. However, my initial thoughts about Europa receeded as I explored and developed the musical material. 'Europa'  was commissioned by the Auckland Philharmonia. The work was first performed by the Dalewool Auckland Brass and the Auckland Philharmonia conducted by Miguel Harth-Bedoya on 13 June 2002 in the Auckland Town Hall. "

A \"fanfare\", however, conjures up visions of red-coated trumpeters standing majestically in a row and playing as loudly as possible!  An orchestral fanfare to open a concert is an unusual animal, somewhat akin to the \"concerto for orchestra\", and can happily be left open to interpretation by the lucky composer who gets to write one. Fanfare for a City begins with a brief opening brass chorale hinting at things to come, a fanfare with a sense of excitement and jubilation culminating in a return to the opening chorale written in Bach style that would never have been written by Bach.  Fanfare for a City was commissioned by Symphony Australia for the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra's 2001 subscription series."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Symphony in Five Movements' was composed in Auckland in 1995/96 for the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra as part of its Composer-in-Residence programme. It was first performed on the 1st August 1996 in a concert at the Aotea Centre, Auckland as part of a Main Series programme. A central idea to the 'Symphony' concerns aspects of timing. Its form was partially inspired by the martial arts treatise 'Go Rin No Sho' (A Book of Five Rings), which considers timing and its relationship to strategy.  The five books are: Ground, Water, Fire, Wind & Void. There is a loose correspondence between the inspiration behind some of the movements and each of the �books.� Thus, the third movement refers to the book of tradition �wind,�and consequently, is modelled on a scherzo, not only paying tribute to Beethoven, but in a broader sense indicating the desire to give the entire work a historical reference.  The Introduction or first movement is analogous to the �ground� book (the path), outlining the Symphony�s musical ideas. The fifth movement (�void�) has a strongly rhythmic structure with contemporary influence throughout, reflected in, and overlayed with its violin-based lyrical stream. This strongly linear work was described by Denys Trussell in a subsequent review for 'Quote Unquote' after its Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra performance in 1996 (conducted by Enrique Diemecke) as being \"rich with feeling and atmosphere.\" The fourth and fifith movements were given a reading by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra conducted by Hamish McKeich at the NZSO - SOUNZ Readings in October 2001 in Wellington.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Maui Tikitiki a Taranga' (\"Maui formed in the topknot of Taranga\") was a demi-god found in the tribal myths of the Maori people of New Zealand. Maui, the fifth and youngest child, was born at the edge of the sea.  His mother, Taranga, thought he was stillborn, and wrapped him in a tuft of her hair and set him adrift.  He was cared for by the seaweed until a breeze blew him ashore, where he was saved and brought up by one of his great-ancestors. Maui was a great prankster.  In one of his mischievous moods he decided to put out all the fires in the world.  To bring fire back, he had to find Mahuika, the goddess of fire.  He was awestruck upon meeting her, but decided to play a trick on her by taking fire from her fingernails one at a time, until she realised his game and threw fire to the ground, catching everything alight.  Maui changed himself into a hawk to escape the flames, which singed his feathers.  He called upon his ancestor to send rain and drench the fire, depriving Mahuika of her powers. Maui decided to defeat death by journeying to where the earth meets the sky, where lived his great-ancestress Hine nui te po (\"Great Hine the Night\").  He was accompanied by many birds, and told them his plan to enter the body of the sleeping Hine and so defeat death.  The birds sat quietly trying not to laugh as Maui, in the form of a caterpillar, crawled towards Hine.  Suddenly the fantail could be quiet no longer and laughed aloud, dancing about with delight.  Hine awoke with a start, realised Maui's trickery, and he was killed."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The three movements of the symphony are:  I - 'Stratagem of Trumpets'  III - 'Mi-1st'  IIII - 'Double Helix'    \"Turning and turning in the widening gyre  The falcon cannot hear the falconer;  Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  Mere anarchy is loosed on the world . . .\"   from \"The Second Coming\" by W. B. Yeats   When asked to compose a work on the meaning and symbolism of the new Millenium I decided to use William Butler Yeats' famous poem \"The Second Coming\" as a starting point.  Written in 1921, when the old order in Europe was breaking down, it suggests a revolution or rotation in history (the gyre) will bring about a 'second coming' of an important historical figure, and the dawn of a new Millenium.  Yeats' vision of the new world order to come is not, however, optimistic.  He sees the coming of a 'rough beast' with a 'lion body and the head of a man', a cold and heartless creature that might be equated with certain infamous and autocratic leaders in the 20th century.   The 'gyre' or revolution is represented in the symphony by a rolling, sliding timpani sound, accompanied by bass drum and tam tam at the start of the work.  This idea becomes an important motif and appears at the very start.  Following the 'gyre', we hear a 'life and death' theme that begins like a cradle song (the birth of Christ), rises, and then twists downwards in a chromatic line.  This theme provides most of the material for what follows.   The slow introduction climaxes with hammer blows, a reference to the death of Christ. From this a trumpet call emerges, becoming a significant motif later in the movement.   In the allegro that follows, the 'life and death' theme is transformed into a fast and restless melody, beginning as pizzicato on the strings.  Complimenting this is a macabre and folky theme on muted trumpet and clarinets, evoking a sort of frenzied, gyrating dance.  The music quietens and a lyrical theme appears on flute, accompanied by timpani and harp and developed by the strings.  As the music climaxes again, the trumpet call reappears, shared around other brass instruments.  The significance of this trumpet call can be seen with reference to another poem, this time by New Zealander Peggy Dunstan:   Stratagem of Trumpets   \"Then the trumpets sounded  Not in a flare of pomp and pageantry  But with a golden lilting laughter  That seemed to open up the sky  So that the music dropped like rain  Upon the upturned faces  And the enchanted ears were closed  To everything except those throbbing notes. . . \"   The trumpets distract the listeners, and make them unaware of the advancing enemy.  Dunstan's poem goes on to describe a massacre of Serbs in 1389 at the time of the battle of Kosovo between Serbs and Turks.  At the time of composing my symphony Kosovo was once again in the grip of war and atrocity, only this time the Serbs were the aggressors and Albanians were the victims.  It seems to me that Kosovo sums up a situation common in our past Millenium: an endless cycle of struggle for land and power, costing many innocent lives.   In the music, the log drum heralds a sort of 'musical battle-field' in which the 'life and death' theme becomes an aggressive, jagged idea, used fugally in an increasingly dissonant texture.  Following the 'battle', solo strings, piccolo and harp provide a brief lament for the dead and the music returns to the music of the Introduction.  This time it is mixed fragments of the flute theme, and the movement ends quietly with the 'gyre' motif.   If the first movement represents the past, then the second movement is a comment on the present.  The title 'Mi-1st' refers to the heavy emphasis on the note E (or Mi in the sol-fa system) as a central pitch, but can also be interpreted as 'me-first'.  Essentially this music is about the natural human tendency to be self-centred, which I believe has become much more prevalent in our own society.  It is perhaps one aspect of Yeats' 'rough beast' that hinders our progress.   There are three main ideas in this presto movement.  The first is a savage chromatic theme that encircles the note E, played initially on strings. It is immediately followed by a vigorous, syncopated theme on strings and winds.  As a contrast, the harp accompanies a quieter, smoother theme on the violins, which also includes the twisting, chromatic motif from the first movement.  In the middle, the music becomes increasingly chaotic until a climax on C is reached, with hope for resolution to the discords.  However, the music slips into the key of B, and the strings play a restless, anxious version of the contrast theme.  The frenetic energy of the first part gradually dissipates, and the movement collapses into a web of solo violins.  The 'gyre' motif has the final say.   There are a number of themes in the third movement, but all evolve in some way or other from the constantly twisting, turning melodic line that appears at the start.  Used in close canon, this melody represents the intertwining DNA molecule, and hence the title of the movement, 'Double Helix'.  Discovered recently in our history, genetics are sure to have a highly significant role in the future.  This music looks forward with the hope that genetics will be used in a positive way.  It also acknowledges that we carry with us the characteristics of previous generations (covering a whole Millenium and more!), and that the future will be significantly shaped by these characteristics. At the same time we need to learn from the hard lessons of previous generations in order to make progress.  Consequently, the symphony has an optimistic and celebratory end, which is tempered by a sense of warning.  In the coda, the threads of 'Double Helix' motifs are combined with a return of the main theme from the first movement, played on full brass.   Dedicated to Sandy  "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The title of this symphony comes from the ominous tam tam stroke that opens the first movement, a mysterious sound heard by two of E M Forster's characters in 'A Passage to India' when they investigate the Marabar Caves. This is a sound which symbolises the mysteries of life and death, although Ritchie warns us not to take it all too literally. \"The echo is only a starting point to a general theme of human struggle. The listener can interpret the music in his or her own way.\" The first movement opens sonorously in the tonality of G, pulsating chords leading us inevitably to the first main theme, a theme that Ritchie himself characterises as a \"muscular, Bruknerian theme\", although the momentum that it engages owes more to Shostakovich. A sinuous saxophone theme is very significant in the central section, as is the lengthy oboe theme in the moderato section. The second movement opens with the sharp, bright sounds of oboes and clarinets accompanied by Cook Islands log drums. The log drum punctuates the movement's textures and creates a sense of propulsion. A light-hearted dance introduced by string quartet offers an opportunity for a change of mood. The third movement is a lament for the victims of the Bosnian wars. The highly evocative scoring of the opening pages was inpsired by the wailing of a Maori karanga, while tolling bells imbue this elegy with a special sense of tragedy. The symphony ends with a 'grand dance' which shows Ritchie has not been untouched by rock music. Several themes are brought together in an ecstatic coda, after which the music slowly unwinds over a reiterated pedal note. The opening of the first movement returns, and the final sound we hear is a single stroke on the tam tam. Symphony No.1 'Boum' was completed while Ritchie was Composer-in-residence with the Dunedin Sinfonia in 1993, and first performed the following year, under the baton of Sir William Southgate. It has recieved numerous performances, and was recorded for radio by the NZSO, in 1998, Auckland Philharmonia in 1996, Dunedin Sinfonia in 1994.  It is due for release on CD in 2007, with The Christchurch Symphony, and Kiwi Pacific Records. "

Although one section is based on a transcription of whale song, there is no programme to the piece - no confrontation with humanity, for instance. The guiding principles were the extreme range of whale song, the changing patterns of their song, and the image, given to me by the late Tungia Baker, of a whale in Campbell Island waters allowing seal pups at play to slide down her flanks over and over again until, tiring of the game, she flipped them gently away.  The taonga puoro (Maori instruments) used in this piece are all made from whale bone or the bone from the albatross, the whale's avian  counterpart.  In the order they are played, the taonga are, the percussive tumutumu, made from the jaw of a pilot whale washed up on Farewell Spit, a karanga manu (bird caller) made from an orca tooth, two nguru (flutes) made from the teeth of sperm whales that stranded one in Tory channel and one at Paekakariki, two putorino koiwi toroa (instruments made here from albatross bones, which have two different voices, being played as flute or trumpet), made here from the wingbones of a wandering albatross from the sub-Antarctic islands and a young royal albatross from the Chatham Islands, a nguru made from the cochlea of a hump-backed whale and finally a putorino koiwi toroa, especially made for this piece from the rib of a right whale that beached at Cable Bay.  Members of the Quartet play percussive instruments - whalebone tumutumu and tokere (castanets). All these instruments were made by Brian Flintoff.  In the score, the taonga puoro sections are improvised; mostly the quartet parts are notated, but sometimes the players are required to improvise.  "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Bele Doette ('Lovely Doette') is based on an anonymous 12th century Chanson de Toile. The vocal line follows the original song-line closely for two of the eight stanzas and refrains.  Doette is at a window, reading, when she receives the news that her friend Doon has been killed in a jousting contest.  The refrain reads \"See now what grief I have\", and at the end she vows to become a nun in the church of St Paul.  The original transcription of the song is published in the Anthology of Medieval Music, edited by Richard Hoppin (1978). Pitches are notated in the transcription but no rhythm. Therefore, rhythm is freely interpreted while the original melismas and word setting are maintained.  The refrain is expanded beyond the original.  The oboe has a dual role. First, it freely develops motifs based on the song-lines by a process using magic squares.  These motifs are used in the introduction and interludes between stanzas and refrains. Second, the oboe has a dialogue with the soprano that involves imitation and decoration, particularly in the refrains.  Bele Doette was commissioned by Pepe Becker, and written for her and oboist, Robert Orr. It has been composed as part of Ritchie's research at the University of Otago. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Untitled (Counterfeit Readymade #1)' is derived from baritone sax improvisations by Wellington-based Jeff Henderson. His improvising was recorded and edited into a 6-minute audio document, which was then transcribed. The transcription is a readymade of sorts, as it is taken from an extant object, and a counterfeit in that it points to a performance that never happened. Though not a risk in this instance - given that the piece is a forgery - a transcription should not efface its object but rather serve as a description through which to approach the original. Put another way, the performance of 'Untitled (Counterfeit Readymade #1)' can be located in relation to the original performance, the derived audio document and the transcription, while being none of these. The marimba part provides commentary on this mercurial object, drawing out and setting in relief its harmonic, melodic and rhythmic features, but rarely doubling it literally."

I have always admired the wry humour and brightness of Kevin Ireland's writing and many years ago set three of his poems for soprano and mixed ensemble.  As a kind gesture Mr Ireland sent me a copy of his book of poems �Skinning A Fish�, and I was particularly struck by the imagery of colours, flowers, feathers and birds in this poem, which illustrates rain pouring down a window pane and giving way to a burst of sunshine after a storm."

This also amplifies a feeling of intimacy with the author, like a conversation with a great storyteller.

  general_note: "NZSO National Youth Orchestra 2005; CD"
  internal_note: "Programme Note: T�-mata-uenga \"God of War, Spirit of Man\" was inspired by the Maori story of creation. In summary, the story starts in the beginning when the world between Rangi-nui, the Sky Father, Papa-t�-�-nuku, the Earth Mother, was cramped and dark. Their children could not grow in this environment and were forced to take action to survive and Rangi and Papa were forced apart - creating the world, as we know it today. I have portrayed the part of the story where T�-mata-uenga struggles to tear Rangi from Papa.   �T�-mata-uenga...leapt at the task, hacking wildly at the sinews that bound Earth and Sky, making them bleed. It is with this act that the sacred red clay, or ochre, was made. But even T�, the fiercest of the sons, could not sever Rangi from his lover Papa.�  There are two distinct themes alternating throughout the work. To represent the �God of War� there are two dominant motives; the semitone, which is used to portray his frustration from his incapability to separate his parents. Secondly, I have used militant rhythmic passages to emphasise the act of war. The second theme is more angular. It reflects another side of T�-mata-uenga, the more complex �Spirit of Man�. It leaps and slides around the dissonant augmented 4th interval. Gradually, another more legato melodic line is infused with the angular theme that takes the piece into a calmer section, which has an almost triumphant melodic line.  "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Violaceous' is an escape from tonality to the land of surrealism: a beautiful place of aural obscurity where serial and tonal elements are combined. The piece is predominantly serial, in four sections. The first section has two contrasting characters, the first is light and carefree while the second is reflective and emotional. They introduce two important motives. The first motive appears in the first six notes, it is a gesture that appears throughout the work in various disguises. The second is the minor second interval that dominates the latter part of the work. The second section is quirky and fun. It develops the grace notes and flourishes of the opening. The third section has the reflective character from the opening section. It gradually increases in tension until it reaches the fourth section, where the piece ends with the unleashing of a wild dance that frees itself by abandoning its rigid serial structure. "

We got to know the Cummings on one of our first trips to Europe when the children were very young. They also had two children of much the same age (also a Fiona Jane!). At the time Bill said how he had been influenced by the painting and ideas of Paul Klee, whose work he�d got to know well through a course given by Michael Harlow. It was therefore appropriate to use texts by Michael in the piece, texts which are about Klee: 1. �Taking a line for a Walk� � elegiac  2. Bee-Bird (Bill?-Bird)� originally from 18 ways to Snatch a Bird 3. Chatter Bird � fast and light contrast � aslo from the �snatches� 4. A Shout � Valedictory and recapitulation of first song The first performance was originally to have been about the same time as the �reading� of the Rothko Variations and we would have visited Christchurch during this NZ trip to hear it but it was adjourned until early 2006 so we will miss it."

At the risk of making lofty claims for the piece, there is more behind 'Snapdragon''s composition that should be made explicit. Snapdragon happens to be political in nature: the piece was written at a time of media frenzy over America's initial attack on Iraq. Snow was falling in Princeton, physically trapping me in a tall apartment, while my connection with the outside world � the TV � projected sensational stories and graphic images of far away places in turmoil. There was a gradual sense of becoming numb, as weather and war preyed on a creeping awareness of my incapacity to act in any tangible way. So, the music that emerged has a poignant physicality: it is music rooted in the body - experiential, dynamic, and earthy. Music that you can feel, folk music, music that makes you dance or shout, the sound of heartbeat, of breath, or a sigh. Music that reflects a sense of anger and helplessness in the face of cruel acts imposed by man or nature. 'Snapdragon' should be played loud! "

Prometheus is seen here as a symbol of those who challenge tyranny for the sake of mankind. By stealing fire from Olympus to give to humans, Prometheus incurred the wrath of Jupiter. He was chained to a rock where, each day, an eagle tore out his liver, and each night it grew whole again. He cursed Jupiter and was hounded by the Furies. Maui stole fire from Mahuika to give to humans and changed himself into an eagle to escape the flames. It is the energy of the curses, the hounding, the wrath of Jupiter, the flight of the eagle, the gift of fire, as well as the compassion of Prometheus and Maui that I have sought to reflect in the music."

The night sky's debris to which the work claims to pay homage has been forgotten by the composer, perhaps signalling the piece was always more significant than the occasion which nominally gave rise to it. Given one cannot literally write down the night sky (or its debris), any more than one can pull it down, it is unsurprising that a juxtapositional collection of motifs captured on manuscript paper should outlive any given evening. The piece, with its calls, upward arcs and gentle falls, may loosely suggest some kind of homage to an unreachable sky, but this relationship is a rebus better left to sing for itself. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: \"The boundary between collection and fetishism is mediated by classification and display in tension with accumulation and secrecy.\"  Two musical strands run virtually throughout this short piece, sometimes clearly differentiated, at other times more obscure and confused, but always at some level presenting an opposition between an 'organic', accretional layer and an 'inorganic' abruptly changing one. This opposition can operate not only at surface level - as it does at the beginning, when two highly differentiated instrumental combinations are presented, each with their own characteristic modes of behaviour - but also at a subcutaneous level, when applied to various ways of generating or modifying the basic material.  These concerns form only the technical armature and implementation of the piece, of course, and much of the original musical imagery was suggested by Borges' short story The Circular Ruins. While giving the obligatory (questionable?) disclaimer about the piece in no way being programmatic, much of the mood and atmosphere of the story was certainly in my mind during the initial sketching stages, and it seems to me that its central conceit - one human dreaming another into existence, by sheer will - is a marvellous metaphor for the act of composition."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: 'Ixion's Wheel' was written during the composer's term as Mozart Fellow in 1993. The work is dedicated to Katherine Austin (piano) and Richard Foreman (clarinet), who gave the premiere performance in the Illot Concert Chamber, Wellington, during the ExtravaCANZa festival of November 1994.  Mythology tells that on account of his aggression and lust, Ixion was lashed to a blazing wheel by Zeus, and sent whirling through the air to eternity. This work is the composer's response to the sad fate of Ixion."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: These songs were commissioned by and written for Goeknil Meryem Biner and Tom McGrath, as part of my work at the University of Otago.  Initially, Cilla McQueen offered me the poem 'Bluff Pantoum' to set to music. After the commission from Goeknil and Tom I requested another pantoum from Cilla, and she obliged with 'Mining Lament'. A pantoum has 4-line stanzas, rhymes, and repeats lines in the following pattern: A B C D   B E D F   E G F H   G I H J  etc The poem 'Bluff Pantoum' was written in 2003 for a friend of the poet's, to give to her husband on her birthday.  It draws on images of the sea, which dominate the environment of Bluff, in Southland.  'Mining Lament' (2004) bemoans the destruction of a �golden hill� in Riverton, Southland, by sluicing.  A BLUFF PANTOUM  MINING LAMENT  I went to see the golden hill but it had all been mined away all that's left is an empty bowl of yellow gorse and rutted clay  But it had all been mined away except a clay bluff topped with stone in yellow gorse and rutted clay one stubborn relic stands alone  Only a clay bluff tipped with stone remains of the hill the painter saw one stubborn relic stands alone of a rounded hill of golden ore  Remains of the hill the painter saw rutted clay and a stumbling stream a rounded hill of golden ore sluiced away with a sluicing gun  Rutted clay and a stumbling stream all that's left is an empty bowl sluiced away with a sluicing gun I went to see the golden hill  (after a painting by Christopher Aubrey, Riverton, c. 1870)"

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Historical background  I got to know Euan Murdoch both as a friend and as a musician when he came to Dunedin to teach cello at the University some years ago.  Everything about Euan encouraged me to write him a piece: his lively and warm personality, his huge enthusiasm for music and his brilliance as a player, plus a certain down-to-earth Kiwi quality that is refreshing to encounter within classical music circles.  Having composed 'The Blue Sonata' for him in 1999, I was approached by Euan to write something else.  He had moved to Wellington for a job at Victoria University, and wanted a piece for Trio Victoria.  I relished this opportunity to compose again for Euan, and for the others in the group, Doug Beilman and Thomas Hecht.   During 2000 I came to the conclusion I needed a substantial break from composing, due to what might be termed creative 'burn out'.  I also wanted the time to reassess the direction I was heading with my music.  Consequently, the trio commission arrived at a time where I felt the urge to experiment and come up with something a little different.  Having said that, there are connecting threads with earlier pieces, particularly my Symphony No.2 which was premiered at the Wellington Arts Festival in 2000.   Piano Trio was commissioned by Chamber Music New Zealand, with funding provided by Creative New Zealand.   The Music  This Piano Trio attempts to suggest psychological states through sound images.  It is not directly programmatic but, as the titles of the movements suggest, there are distinct ideas and moods imbedded in the music.  The first movement uses imaginary characters from childhood - 'Maggie Boy' and 'Nice Boy' - as representations of two sides of personality: the bad and the good, or the dark and the light.  'Maggie Boy' has music that is barbarous, angular and dissonant.  In the opening section a 12-note theme appears, providing the basis for much of the material that follows.   Following a metric modulation (or change in note values) the violin and cello play a wispy, lyrical theme that portrays 'Nice Boy', while the pianist's right hand tinkers away with 12-note themes, impervious to the sentiments of the strings.  'Maggie Boy' returns in the final section of the movement, dispatching 'Nice Boy' to the recesses of the mind.   The second movement, 'The Deamon', is concerned with neither good nor bad but rather the nothingness of depression, that caged state of mind where emotions and feelings seem to spiral inwards.  Melodic lines twist and turn, trying to find a way out of the psychological cage.  Reference is made to the 12-note theme from the first movement, as well as the 'life and death' theme from my Symphony No.2.   The third movement, 'Hyper-dyper' is, as its title suggests, ebullient and almost frantically busy. An angular and jazzy opening theme is followed by a nervous, darting second theme featuring some special effects on the strings. The piano rudely interrupts proceedings and a playful but tense middle section follows, based on the 12-note theme from the first movement. In the Coda the 'hyper' quality dominates and the Trio comes to an end on a crunching discord. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Oppositions was composed for The New Zealand Piano Quartet, for inclusion on a CD of the composer's chamber music, released by Kiwi-Pacific Records.   It is in one movement, and is based around the idea of opposing forces, whether they be literal or imaginative.  In musical terms, the piano is frequently pitted against the strings, while musical themes seem to jostle for supremacy.   After a short and ominous introduction, the strident first  theme is  played on violin, accompanied by hammered chords.   A second theme has all three stringed instruments playing in  'cluster' harmonies.  The cello announces a lyrical but turbulent idea, and this is played in counterpoint with the first theme.   The piano is to the fore in a third theme, which is stealthy and marked by sudden outbursts.   These themes are discussed in a middle section that gradually winds down to very soft, thudding chords, before building up to a vigorous return of the opening. In this final section themes are fragmented and tossed around violently, before a brief Coda in which the first theme appears dominant. "

The work's primary layer of materials - the catalogue - is pure musique concr�te, exploring the possibilities for a music of the 'raw'. Relationships between objects in this layer are established analogically, by similarities both direct and indirect. These, along with a secondary layer of materials providing soft embellishments of the 'catalogue', are the analogues the title refers to."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: While making this piece, I was enthralled by my daughter�s experimentation with language, at the age of nineteen months. Recognisable English words were freely mingled with streams of idiosyncratic verbal utterance, and while meaning was often obscure to adult ears, patterns of words and sounds were repeated in a way that was clearly linguistic. The title of the piece is one of these patterns, which she used frequently, and which I am still unable to translate. To me, such playfulness suggests musical processes. Almost from birth, the toys which most held her attention were those which made sounds. In response to this, I had recorded a collection of the toys which had most fascinated her around the age of seven months. Nearly a year later, the sounds finally accumulated into a musical shape. I can only dream of recapturing for myself the inventiveness of a young child, but the observation of the child�s manipulation of sound and meaning leaves its traces in my work."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: The Concerto was written in January 2006 as fulfilment of a long standing promise to write a piece for Saxophonist Simon Brew. What began, in concept, as a modest \"concertino\" grew into a five movement \"grand\" concerto of nearly 30 minutes, which makes it, according to Simon, one of the longer concertos in the Alto Saxophone repertoire; I'm still not quite sure how it happened, it just kept on growing. The Concerto was commissioned by the Wellington Youth Sinfonietta, is dedicated to Simon, and was premiered in May 2006. The first two movements are were later presented at the NZSO-SOUNZ Readings on 6 November 2006. The first movement is an accompanied cadenza for the saxophone which outlines the major thematic material for the concerto. This movement reoccurs, in modified form, as the central episode of the last movement. The second movement is in traditional concerto sonata form. The Concerto unashamedly follows classical structures throughout. Avant-garde it ain't!"

The Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Fam�lia, which stands proudly in Barcelona was designed by Spain's  most prominent modernist architect, Antoni Gaud�. When I first saw it I was moved by its originality and beauty, I was also astounded by the creator�s incredible imagination.  The piece is in two movements. Firstly, I have explored the foreboding nature of the building; the way it looks as though it were melting, twisting and almost lurching as it towers over you. Then in the second movement the music takes us on a winding journey down from the bell towers. Taking delight in the beautiful fa�ades, shapes, glass and mosaics on the way. "

  internal_note: "Programme Note: When I was initially approached to write this work to celebrate Auckland Choral�s 150th anniversary, I knew I wanted to write a piece that would be accessible, both chorally and instrumentally, to the wider choral community. I wanted it to have a life beyond that of the specific occasion for which it was commissioned. I was also keen to include a �youth� choral element. My first decisions concerned the text. I felt that in writing a work for New Zealand�s oldest arts organisation, I wanted to set one of the texts traditionally associated with a large symphonic choir. Hence the Latin Mass as the basis of the text. I also wanted to include elements which would place the work securely in the Asia/Pacific area. New Zealand is uniquely placed between these two areas of the world, and increasingly looks in both directions for its cultural identity. The �additional� texts are drawn from New Zealand, Pacific and Asian sources. While the main choir largely sings the traditional Latin text, the �youth� choir and soloists sing the other texts. At times this distinction is blurred, most notably towards the end of the work. I also wanted to avoid writing a work that became a catalogue of �trendy effects� and ethnic/cultural associations. I�ve used specific musical allusions sparingly in both the choral parts and the scoring. (Hence also the deliberate spelling �Pacifica� rather than �Pasifika�.) The instrumentation is the same as that of Bernstein�s �Chichester Psalms�. This was a practical decision. It is an ensemble that is not hard to assemble: 3 each of trumpets and trombones, 5 percussionists, 2 harps, and strings. It also provides the Bernstein with a companion piece suitable to fill out a concert. The opening �Kyrie� begins with a distant voice suggesting a Maori �karanga� � a calling together. The music then becomes more rhythmic with the women�s voices presenting a lyrical melody. The men�s voices enter at the �Christe eleison�, with the repeat of the �Kyrie� introducing the two solo voices. The second movement combines a traditional Maori text of unknown authorship with Joy Cowley�s bi-lingual �Morning Blessing�. The percussionists suggest the rhythmic sound of pois, while the upper strings and harps suggest a guitar (a guitar may also be added). The �youth� choir sings the Maori text while the women of the main choir sing the English words of the Cowley text, and the men the Maori words. The next four movements set the text of the �Gloria�. The third movement begins with lively and rhythmic music, giving way later to more sustained singing. The end of the movement pays homage to the �Chichester Psalms� where the opening rhythmic music returns quietly against as sustained note in the choir � emulating the end of the second movement of the Bernstein. The fourth movement, �Domine Deus� is for soprano solo, while the fifth movement �Qui tollis� features both soloists. The sixth movement initially features the alto soloist, with the main choir soon joining in. The music is lively until more sustained music from the first part of the �Gloria� returns at the words �Cum Sancto Spiritu...�. Finally the opening �Gloria� music returns and the movement ends with a noisy and energetic �Amen�. The seventh movement features the �youth� choir with just the percussion section. Here the music suggests a type of Pacific Island choral singing, using a �call and response� technique typical of such choral traditions and also of many Afro-American spirituals. The text is a simple entreaty to God, sung in the Tongan language. This work is essentially a �missa brevis� � a Mass without the Credo. Once I reached the Credo text it became obvious that to include it would mean a work of more substantial length than required. However I decided to include a short instrumental movement, as a meditation on that text. While working on the music I added the two solo voices as well � they sing the opening and closing lines of the Credo text. It is a dark, brooding and questioning movement. Following a brief dissonant opening section, the music develops into a long slow canon for the strings and harps. Once the voices enter, the preceding music reappears with a simpler harmonic framework. The movement ends rather abruptly although quite gently, but still without a sense of complete resolution. The Sanctus allows the men�s voices a chance to feature. After two attempts at writing a noisy vigorous movement, I ended up writing music that starts gently and rather like plainsong - the music is marked �reverently�. The �Pleni sunt coeli� section begins softly, but gradually as more voice parts enter, it builds to a massive climax. The music returns briefly to a softer and more reflective mood at the end of the movement. The Benedictus returns to music from the Quoniam section of the Gloria. The traditional Latin text is replaced by a Maori translation of the words. The soprano soloist has a melodic line that at times suggests the contour of traditional chant. The Hosanna (�Ohana i runga rawa�) has the main choir alternating bold tonal chords with the treble voices of the youth choir. While writing this movement I felt I wanted something to complement the energetic and noisy singing, and finally decide to incorporate a setting of �Whisper to me� � a lullaby text by Patricia Grace. This work already existed as an independent piece having been commissioned by St Cuthbert�s College (Auckland) in 2003. The words, partly in English and partly in Maori, provide a beautiful counterpoint to the blessing of the preceding music. The lively eleventh movement mixes the Agnus Dei text with a Maori hymn text by Hirini Melbourne. The words speak of being �cleansed by the wind, washed by the rain�. The women of the main choir sing a simple counter-melody part based on the chorale from the fifth movement. I wanted to include texts beyond the immediate Pacific area, to acknowledge that New Zealand is also part of Asia. I finally found the poem �Outing� by noted Singaporean poet Edwin Thumboo. Professor Thumboo is Director of the Centre for the Arts at the National University of Singapore. The text begins �Therefore bring your words with you. They grow in number, shuffle, show disquiet...�, and this seemed to be a wonderful summary of the ideas behind the whole work � a gathering together of diverse texts with their many associations and cultural meanings. The music, sung by the two soloists, is based on music from the canon section of the Credo, somewhat simplified. One of my early choral experiences was to sing in the �Dona nobis pacem� from Bach�s �B minor Mass�, and the gradual unfolding of that music is suggested in my own setting of those words. The music which was first heard as the �Pleni sunt coeli� in the Sanctus reappears. At first it appears intermittently, interrupting the text of �Outing�, then builds gradually to include the youth choir�s voices in a final climax. �Missa Pacifica� then ends with an extended jubilant �Amen� section. The premiere of �Missa Pacifica� was scheduled for not long before my fiftieth birthday. It seemed, on reflection, that this major work presents a summary of my compositional style up to this point. I also sense the beginnings of a change to a leaner style in other recent works, so perhaps �Missa Pacifica� marks a watershed moment in my compositional career. �Missa Pacifica� was commissioned by Auckland Choral (Musical Director Peter Watts) with funding from Creative New Zealand, It was commissioned to mark the choir�s 150th anniversary in 2005. Special thanks go to the authors of the texts used in the work, who so willingly allowed their poetry to be part of this project. �Missa Pacifica� was first performed on 6th November 2005 by Auckland Choral conducted by Peter Watts. The soloists were Morag Atchison (soprano) and Kate Spence (alto), with Piper�s Sinfonia and choirs from Westlake Girls and Boys High Schools, Rangitoto College, Epsom Girls Grammar School and Diocesan School for Girls.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Markheim is a man at the end of his tether. What started as a robbery gone wrong has ended in a murder � a murder that seems certain to force him to kill once more. And then kill again. Trapped, he is made to confront circumstances that have brought him to this terrible crisis. Just at the moment a mysterious stranger appears � but it soon becomes clear that this saviour is not all he seems. Is he the devil driving to further temptation and inevitable damnation? Or an angel come to save him from himself? Loosely based on R. L. Stevenson�s macabre story, Markheim, a haunting story of guilt and redemption, Good Angel and Bad Angel is a chamber opera for three voices and four instrumentalists.   SYNOPSIS: The opera opens in an old curio-shop where the owner and his daughter are having a row. She feels unappreciated by her miserly father and says she�d prefer to spend Christmas Day with someone who cares for her � her boyfriend. She storms out leaving the old man to his gold and silver. A knock at the shop door. The shopkeeper is reluctant to open, but realising it could be a potential customer, lets in the caller. It is Markheim, a small time thief. He claims he wants to buy a Christmas present for his girlfriend. The old man shows him his stock. When the old man�s back is turned Markheim kills him. Believing that there is a hoard of gold hidden somewhere in the shop, Markheim is now free to look for it. Another knock at the door. Two drunks are wanting to visit the old man. Markheim doesn�t answer and tries not to panic. Finally the drunks wanter off. Quite unexpectedly, a complete stranger � the visitant � enters from the back of the shop. He offers to tell Markheim where the gold is hidden. Fearing the unknown Markheim refuses to answer. The visitant tells him the old man�s daughter is coming back to the shop to apologise for her outburst. If Markheim is still here when she arrives, he will have to kill the daughter as well to cover his crime. A dialogue follows with Markheim realising more and more the hopelessness of his position. The visitant keeps reminding him that the daughter will be arriving very soon. Markheim insists the money will allow him to start a new life and in a high dramatic solo passage declares that freedom is within his grasp. The murder is one-off, he claims � and from now on his life will be on the straight and narrow. A knock at the door. It is the daughter. The visitant says Markheim will have to let her in. Then he will have to kill her. Markheim opens the door and tells her that her father is dead. At first she thinks the old man collapsed and that the doctor has been called. Then Markheim shows her the knife. Realising what has happened she sings a moving lament for her father and begs for her life. The powerful trio that follows is interrupted by a knock at the door. It will be her boyfriend. The girl starts to scream for help. For Markheim this is the end. Or perhaps a new beginning.  "

By contrast the postlude requires each player to relinquish their individuality and be absorbed by the ensemble, forming a dense and ever changing kaleidoscope of sound. In spite of the apparent contrasts between all seven movements they are, at a level beneath the surface, all manifestations of the same basic material and represent seven possible outcomes of the same process of growth. \"six preludes and a postlude\" was commissioned by Chamber Music New Zealand Inc with the assistance of Creative New Zealand, Toi Aotearoa.

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Music plays with time in so many ways - bending it, compressing it, folding it, expanding it...  What role can silence play in this game of temporal illusion?  Apart from its obvious potential as a kind of temporal/sonic punctuation, breaking up the apparently continuous flow of time, silence is pregnant with the potential for reflection - reflection on what has come before and on what may be yet to come.  Taken to an extreme, silence can introduce a kind of entropy into a piece - a long silence can fracture a piece so severly that it functions as an open door, inviting the listener to wander off, away from the world of the composer. But silence is much more than just the absence of sound.  It has a ritualistic aspect.  Think of the minute of silence dedicated to the dead, think of the silence of meditation and prayer that takes us beyond the noise and continuity of quotidian existence.  Perhaps music can be a metaphor for silence on this level.  Perhaps the whole musical work can function as an extended metaphorical silence interrupting our everyday concerns, inviting reflection, turning down the internal dialogue and fading out the conceptual grid."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: Much of the surface of this piece inhabits an area on the brink of silence.  This is an extremely unsafe are for the performer, because he or she constantly risks losing the sound altogether.  It is hoped that the soft dynamic levels focus the listener's attention on the microscopic shifts in timbre, pitch and loudness that are the central material of the composition. Below the surface, rather than employing an overall unifying structure/process, several processes are active simultaneously, and much of the composition is the result of these processes tearing at each other while competing for priorty.  There is an \"organic\" process of growth, that conditions the placement of events in time, as well as the pitch and timbral relationships between these events.  Superimposed on this structure is a spectral analysis of the title of the piece, taken from Ezra Pound's \"Cantos\", which also impacts on the placement of events and their internal shape, effectively \"damaging\" the underlying organic organisation.  The third main layer relates to pitch organisation and is based on an analysis of Edgard Varese's \"Density 21.5\".  This layer is of particular importance for the \"grace note\" figures that abound, figures which exist \"outside\" the main body of the composition, but give important structural clues relating to both the first and second processes mentioned above. \"And, out of nothing, a breathing, hot breath on my ankles\" was written for, and is dedicated to Ales Kacjan."

  internal_note: "Programme Note: In this work, inspired by Paekakariki on the Kapiti Coast -�home� during the composer�s six-week residency at Victoria University in 1989 - the relationship between music and environment is particularly strong.  The cello�s low repeated D, which opens the piece, is the fundamental pitch heard in the sea and the restless semi-quavers evoke the continuous movement of waves crashing on the Paekakariki shore. Whitehead�s fascination with medieval philosophy and music, incorporating concepts of natural cycles, is reflected both in the title and in the compositional process, where magic squares were used to generate the background structure.

Arapatiki translates (from the Maori language) as 'the way of the flounder', and is the ancient name  of the sand flats in front of my house at Harwood, near Dunedin. The piece has something to do with the advance and retreat of the tide across the flats, where many species of sea and water birds spend much of the day - an ever-varying water-scape. The opening idea is based on the song of the korimako or bellbird. "

The English verse is set in a conventionally melodic style, while the Maori verse is set in a style suggesting the melodic and rhythmic forms of traditional waiata. Against this second verse a solo cello plays the original melody. The work ends by dissipating into sounds suggesting night. The text for �Whisper to me� is used by kind permission of the author Patricia Grace. �Whisper to me� was commissioned by St Cuthbert�s College, Auckland in 2003. It was subsequently incorporated into the major choral work �Missa Pacifica� (2004)."
