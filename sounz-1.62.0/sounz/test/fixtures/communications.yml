                        letter from Liszt on making acquaintance with his Sonata for violin
                        and piano, Op. 8, which he praised in high terms. He invited Grieg
                        to come and visit him, that they might become better acquainted. This
                        unsolicitated appreciation from the famous Liszt was a fine honor
                        for the young composer, and was the means of inducing the Norwegian
                        Government to grant him an annuity. This sum enabled him the following
                        year, to go to Rome and meet Liszt personally.
                        Once arrived at the Cantorei, Josef plunged into his studies with
                        great fervor, and his progress was most rapid. He was now possessed
                        with a desire to compose, but had not the slightest idea how to go
                        about such a feat. However, he hoarded every scrap of music paper he
                        could find and covered it with notes. Reutter gave no encouragement to
                        such proceedings. One day he asked what the boy was about, and when
                        he heard the lad was composing a \x22Salve Regina,\x22 for twelve voices,
                        he remarked it would be better to write it for two voices before
                        attempting it in twelve. \x22And if you must try your hand at
                        composition,\x22 added Reutter more kindly, \x22write variations on the
                        motets and vespers which are played in church.\x22"

                        With the help of the annuity Grieg was able to give up teaching and
                        conducting and devote himself to composition. He left Christiania,
                        where he and Mme. Grieg had resided for eight years, and came back
                        for a time to Bergen. Here, in January 1874, Ibsen offered him the
                        proposition of writing music for his work, for which he was arranging
                        a stage production.

  communication_note: "Saint-Saens was director with Bussine until 1886. But from 1881 the
                        influence of Franck and his disciples became more and more felt; and
                        Saint-Saens began to lose interest in the efforts of the new school. In
                        1886 there was a division of opinion about a proposition of Vincent
                        dIndys to introduce the works of classical masters and foreign
                        composers into the programmes. This proposition was adopted; but
                        Saint-Saens and Bussine sent in their resignations. Franck then became
                        the true president, although he refused the title; and after his death,
                        in 1890, Vincent dIndy took his place. Under these two directors a
                        quite important place was given to old and classical music by composers
                        such as Palestrina, Vittoria, Josquin, Bach, Haendel, Rameau, Gluck,
                        Beethoven, Schumann, Liszt, and Brahms. Foreign contemporary music only
                        occupied a very limited place. Wagners name only appears once, in a
                        transcription of the _Venusberg_ for the pianoforte; and Richard
                        Strausss name figures only against his Quartette. Grieg had his hour of
                        popularity there about 1887, as well as the Russians--Moussorgski,
                        Borodine, Rimsky-Korsakow, Liadow, and Glazounow--whom M. Debussy has
                        perhaps helped to make known to us. At the present moment the Society
                        seems more exclusively French than ever; and the influence of M. Vincent
                        dIndy and the school of Franck is predominant. That is only natural;
                        the _Societe Nationale_ most truly earned its title to glory by
                        discerning Cesar Francks genius; for the Society was a little sanctuary
                        where the great artist was honoured at a time when he was ignored or
                        laughed at by the rest of the world. This character of a sanctuary was
                        kept even after victory. In its general programme of 1903-1904, the
                        Society reminded us with pride that it had remained faithful to the
                        promises made in 1871; and it added that if, in order to permit its
                        members to keep abreast of the general progress of art, it had little by
                        little allowed classical masterpieces and modern foreign works of
                        interest on its programmes, it had, however, always kept its
                        guest-chamber open, and shaped many a future reputation there."

                        like the world itself, successive stages of youth, maturity, and
                        old age; but it never dies--it renews itself perpetually. It is not
                        like a perfect circle; it is like a spiral, and in its growth is
                        always mounting higher. I believe in making students follow the
                        same path that art itself has followed, so that they shall undergo
                        during their term of study the same transformations that music
                        itself has undergone during the centuries. In this way they will
                        come out much better armed for the difficulties of modern art,
                        since they will have lived, so to speak, the life of art, and
                        followed the natural and inevitable order of the forms that made up
                        the different epochs of artistic development.\x22"

  communication_subject: "A noisy fame surrounds his person and his work."
  communication_note: "In music he learned a great deal from his friend Schalk,[184] a
                        professor at the Vienna Conservatoire; but, like Berlioz, he got most of
                        his education from the libraries, and spent months in reading the scores
                        of the great masters. Not having a piano, he used to carry Beethovens
                        sonatas to the Prater Park in Vienna and study them on a bench in the
                        open air. He soaked himself in the classics--in Bach and Beethoven, and
                        the German masters of the _Lied_--Schubert and Schumann. He was one of
                        the young Germans who was passionately fond of Berlioz; and it is due to
                        Wolf that France was afterwards honoured in the possession of this great
                        artist, whom French critics, whether of the school of Meyerbeer, Wagner,
                        Franck, or Debussy, have never understood. He was also early a friend of
                        old Anton Bruckner, whose music we do not know in France, neither his
                        eight symphonies, nor his _Te Deum_, nor his masses, nor his cantatas,
                        nor anything else of his fertile work. Bruckner had a sweet and modest
                        character, and an endearing, if rather childish, personality. He was
                        rather crushed all his life by the Brahms party; but, like Franck in
                        France, he gathered round him new and original talent to fight the
                        academic art of his time.
                        But the best of his teaching lies in his life. One can never speak too
                        highly of his disinterested devotion for the good of art. As if it were
                        not enough to put all his might into his own creations, M. dIndy gives
                        his time and the results of his study unsparingly to others. Franck gave
                        lessons in order to be able to live; M. dIndy gives them for the
                        pleasure of instructing, and to serve his art and aid artists. He
                        directs schools, and accepts and almost seeks out the most thankless,
                        though the most necessary, kinds of teaching. Or he will apply himself
                        devoutly to the study of the past and the resuscitation of some old
                        master. And he seems to take so much pleasure in training young minds to
                        appreciate music, or in repairing the injustices of history to some fine
                        but forgotten musician, that he almost forgets about himself. To what
                        work or to what worker, worthy of interest, or seeming to be so, has he
                        ever refused his advice and help? I have known his kindness personally,
                        and I shall always be sincerely grateful for it.
                        Everything connected with the theater was of absorbing interest to
                        this precocious child. Weber, who lived in Dresden, often passed their
                        house and was observed with almost religious awe by little Richard.
                        Sometimes the great composer dropped in to have a chat with the
                        mother, who was well liked among musicians and artists. Thus Weber
                        became the idol of the lads boyhood, and he knew \x22Der Freischetz\x22
                        almost by heart. If he was not allowed to go to the theater to
                        listen to his favorite opera, there would be scenes of weeping and
                        beseeching, until permission was granted for him to run off to the
                        performance."

                        music in Desseldorf, left vacant by the departure of Ferdinand Hiller
                        for Cologne. Schumann and his wife went to Desseldorf the first week
                        of September and were received with open arms. A banquet and concert
                        were arranged, at which some of the composers important works were
                        performed. His duties in the new post were conducting the subscription
                        concerts, weekly rehearsals of the Choral Club and other musical
                        performances. He seemed well content with the situation and it did not
                        require too much of his physical strength.
                        While at work in Paris, young Debussy made an occasional side trip to
                        another country. In 1879 he visited Russia, where he learned to know
                        the music of that land, yet undreamed of by the western artists. When
                        his turn came to go to Rome, for which honor he secured the prize, he
                        sent home the required compositions, a Symphonic Suite \x22Spring,\x22 and

                        sacred cow and they regarded the older members in the light of
                        special pets. But when, at the opening of the new season, they heard
                        a brilliant, completely rejuvenated orchestra, they forgave the new
                        conductor. Since then, he has restored the Symphony to its old-time
                        glory. Today Beacon Hill has no greater favorite than Serge

                        It was a struggle, and one less determined than the fourteen-year-old
                        boy would have given up in despair. He was made of different stuff.
                        Working alone by himself, he composed a sonata, a quartette and
                        an aria. At last he ventured to announce the result of his secret
                        studies. At this news his relatives were up in arms; they judged
                        his desire for music to be a passing fancy, especially as they knew
                        nothing of any preparatory studies, and realized he had never learned
                        to play any instrument, not even the piano.
                        The first ideas of _Siegfried_ were contemporary with the Revolution of
                        1848, which Wagner took part in with the same enthusiasm he put into
                        everything else. His recognised biographer, Herr Houston Stewart
                        Chamberlain--who, with M. Henri Lichtenberger, has succeeded best in
                        unravelling Wagners complex soul, though he is not without certain
                        prejudices--has been at great pains to prove that Wagner was always a
                        patriot and a German monarchist. Well, he may have been so later on, but
                        it was not, I think, the last phase of his evolution. His actions speak
                        for themselves. On 14 June, 1848, in a famous speech to the National
                        Democratic Association, Wagner violently attacked the organisation of
                        society itself, and demanded both the abolition of money and the
                        extinction of what was left of the aristocracy. In _Das Kunstwerk der
                        Zukunft_ (1849) he showed that beyond the \x22local nationalism\x22 were signs
                        of a \x22supernational universalism.\x22 And all this was not merely talk, for
                        he risked his life for his ideas. Herr Chamberlain himself quotes the
                        account of a witness who saw him, in May, 1849, distributing
                        revolutionary pamphlets to the troops who were besieging Dresden. It was
                        a miracle that he was not arrested and shot. We know that after Dresden
                        was taken a warrant was out against him, and he fled to Switzerland,
                        with a passport on which was a borrowed name. If it be true that Wagner
                        later declared that he had been \x22involved in error and led away by his
                        feelings\x22 it matters little to the history of that time. Errors and
                        enthusiasms are an integral part of life, and one must not ignore them
                        in a mans biography under the pretext that he regretted them twenty or
                        thirty years later, for they have, nevertheless, helped to guide his
                        actions and impressed his imagination. It was out of the Revolution
                        itself that _Siegfried_ directly sprang.
                        [Footnote 169: _Beyond Good and Evil_, 1886. I hope I may be excused for
                        introducing Nietzsche here, but his thoughts seem constantly to be
                        reflected in Strauss, and to throw much light on the soul of modern
                        Germany.]"

  communication_note: "At that time there lived in Palestrina a peasant pair, Sante Pierluigi
                        and his wife Maria, who seem to have been an honest couple, and not
                        grindingly poor, since the will of Santes mother has lately been
                        found, in which she bequeathed a house in Palestrina to her two sons.
                        Besides this she left behind a fine store of bed linen, mattresses and
                        cooking utensils. Maria Gismondi also had a little property.
                        All this involved five courses, with many lectures each week,
                        taking up form, harmony, counterpoint, fugue, composition, vocal and
                        instrumental music, both from the technical and interpretative
                        side. It was a tremendous labor to organize and keep all this going,
                        unaided. After two years he was granted an assistant, who took over
                        the elementary classes. But even with this help, MacDowells labors
                        were increasingly arduous. He now had six courses instead of five,
                        which meant more classes and lectures each week. Perhaps the most
                        severe drain on his time and strength was the continual correction of
                        exercise books and examination papers, a task which he performed with
                        great patience and thoroughness. Added to all this, he devoted every
                        Sunday morning to his advanced students, giving them help and advice
                        in their piano work and in composition."

                        friends, fell deeply in love with Marie Moke, a beautiful, talented
                        girl who, later on, won considerable fame as a pianist. She became
                        interested in the young French composer, through hearing of his mental
                        suffering from Hiller. They were thrown together in a school where
                        both gave lessons, she on the piano and he on the--guitar! Meeting so
                        constantly, her dainty beauty won a warm place in the affections of
                        the impressionable Hector. She was but eighteen, while her admirer was
                        twenty-five.

                        applauding."

                        intentions, this meeting of nations resulted in a fight, on musical
                        ground, between two civilisations and two arts--French art and German
                        art. For these two arts represent to-day all that is truly alive in
                        European music.

                        intentionally or not, unfavourable to France. And yet to the eyes of an
                        impartial observer the result was full of hope and encouragement for us."

                        Planer also found an engagement at the theater, and the two were
                        married on November 24, 1836; he was twenty-three and she somewhat
                        younger. Kind, gentle, loving, she was quite unable to understand she
                        was linked with a genius. Wagner was burdened with debts, begun in
                        Magdeburg and increased in Kenigsberg. She was almost as improvident
                        as he. They were like two children playing at life, with fateful
                        consequences. It was indeed her misfortune, as one says, that this
                        gentle dove was mismated with an eagle. But Minna learned later,
                        through dire necessity, to be more economical and careful, which is
                        more than can be said of her gifted husband."

  communication_note: "I have given more than enough reasons to account for the success of
                        _Pelleas et Melisande_ and the place that its admirers give it in the
                        history of opera. There is every reason to believe that the composer has
                        not been as acutely conscious of his musico-dramatic reform as his
                        disciples have been. The reform with him has a more instinctive
                        character; and that is what gives it its strength. It responds to an
                        unconscious yet profound need of the French spirit. I would even venture
                        to say that the historical importance of Debussys work is greater than
                        its artistic value. His personality is not without faults, and the
                        gravest are perhaps negative faults--the absence of certain qualities,
                        and even of the strong and extravagant faults which made the heroes of
                        the art world, like Beethoven and Wagner. His voluptuous nature is at
                        once changeable and precise; and his dreams are as clear and delicate as
                        the art of a poet of the Pleiades in the sixteenth century, or of a
                        Japanese painter. But among all his gifts he has a quality which I have
                        not found so evident in any other musician--except perhaps Mozart; and
                        this quality is a genius for good taste. Debussy has it in excess, so
                        that he almost sacrifices the other elements of art to it, until the
                        passionate force of his music, even its very life, seems to be
                        impoverished. But one must not deceive oneself; that impoverishment is
                        only apparent, and in all his work there are evidences that his passion
                        is only veiled. It is only the trembling of the melodic line, or the
                        orchestration which, like a shadow passing before the eyes, tells us of
                        the drama that is being played in the hearts of his characters. This
                        lofty shame of emotion is something as rare in opera as a Racine tragedy
                        is in poetry--they are works of the same order, and both of them perfect
                        flowers of the French spirit. Anyone who lives in foreign parts and is
                        curious to know what France is like and understand her genius should
                        study _Pelleas et Melisande_ as they would study Racines _Berenice_.
                        The young musician had plenty of work to do, more than most boys
                        of thirteen. For, besides the concerts he had to give, he was set
                        difficult problems by the various professors who wished to test his
                        powers. The fame of his playing constantly spread, so the further he
                        traveled into Italy there were more demands to hear him. At Roveredo,
                        where it was announced he would play the organ in St. Thomass Church,
                        the crowd was so great he could scarcely get to the organ-loft. The
                        vast audience listened spellbound, and then refused to disperse till
                        they had caught a glimpse of the boy player. At Verona he had another
                        triumph; one of his symphonies was performed, and his portrait was
                        ordered to be painted.
                        Above all, one must not make the mistake of contrasting Berlioz with
                        Wagner, either by sacrificing Berlioz to that Germanic Odin, or by
                        forcibly trying to reconcile one to the other. For there are some who
                        condemn Berlioz in the name of Wagners theories; and others who, not
                        liking the sacrifice, seek to make him a forerunner of Wagner, or kind
                        of elder brother, whose mission was to clear a way and prepare a road
                        for a genius greater than his own. Nothing is falser. To understand
                        Berlioz one must shake off the hypnotic influence of Bayreuth. Though
                        Wagner may have learnt something from Berlioz, the two composers have
                        nothing in common; their genius and their art are absolutely opposed;
                        each one has ploughed his furrow in a different field."

  communication_note: "In 1848, Wagner was not yet thinking of a Tetralogy, but of an heroic
                        opera in three acts called _Siegfrieds Tod_, in which the fatal power
                        of gold was to be symbolised in the treasure of the Niebelungen; and
                        Siegfried was to represent \x22a socialist redeemer come down to earth to
                        abolish the reign of Capital.\x22 As the rough draft developed, Wagner went
                        up the stream of his heros life. He dreamed of his childhood, of his
                        conquest of the treasure, of the awakening of Bruennhilde; and in 1851 he
                        wrote the poem of _Der Junge Siegfried_. Siegfried and Bruennhilde
                        represent the humanity of the future, the new era that should be
                        realised when the earth was set free from the yoke of gold. Then Wagner
                        went farther back still, to the sources of the legend itself, and Wotan
                        appeared, the symbol of our time, a man such as you or I--in contrast to
                        Siegfried, man as he ought to be, and one day will be. On this subject
                        Wagner says, in a letter to Roeckel: \x22Look well at Wotan; he is the
                        unmistakable likeness of ourselves, and the sum of the present-day
                        spirit, while Siegfried is the man we wait and wish for--the future man
                        whom we cannot create, but who will create himself by our
                        annihilation--the most perfect man I can imagine.\x22 Finally Wagner
                        conceived the Twilight of the Gods, the fall of the Valhalla--our
                        present system of society--and the birth of a regenerated humanity.
                        Wagner wrote to Uhlig in 1851 that the complete work was to be played
                        after the great Revolution.
                        Chopins health now began to be a source of anxiety to his friends.
                        He had to be very careful, gave fewer lessons during the season, and
                        spent his vacations at Nohant. He played rarely in public, though
                        there were two public concerts in 1841 and 42 at Pleyels rooms. From
                        1843 to 1847 he lived quietly and his life was apparently happy. He
                        was fond of the Sand children, and amused himself with them when at
                        Nohant.

                        Leopold changed all that. Leander-like, he leaped from the wings,
                        dashed to the center of the stage, nodded curtly to the customers,
                        then accepted the baton which was handed to him, with a flourish, by
                        one of the viola players, and, before you could say \x22Wolfgang Amadeus
                        Mozart,\x22 plunged into the opening number."

  communication_subject: "The poor boys life had few comforts, and this custom of collections brought him into much danger."
  communication_note: "Then follows a real scene in fairyland. Vita stands before the sea and
                        invokes it in an incantation full of weird and beautiful vocal music:
                        \x22O sea! Sinister sea with your angry charm, gentle sea with your kiss of
                        death, hear me!\x22 And the sea replies in a song. Voices mingle with the
                        orchestra in a symphony of increasing anger. Vita swears she will give
                        herself to no one but the Stranger. She lifts the emerald above her
                        head, and it shines with a lurid light. \x22Receive, O sea, as a token of
                        my oath, the sacred stone, the holy emerald! Then may its power be no
                        longer invoked, and none may know again its protecting virtue. Jealous
                        sea, take back your own, the last offering of a betrothed! With an
                        impressive gesture she throws the emerald into the waves, and a dark
                        green light suddenly shines out against the black sky. This supernatural
                        light slowly spreads over the water until it reaches the horizon, and
                        the sea begins to roll in great billows.\x22 Then the sea takes up its song
                        in an angrier tone; the orchestra thunders, and the storm bursts.
                        The dramatic tendency of these oratorios is very marked, and it is
                        chiefly on that account that they have conquered Italy. In spite of some
                        passages which have strayed a little in the direction of opera, or even
                        melodrama, the music shows great depth of feeling. The figures of the
                        women especially are drawn with delicacy; and in the second part of
                        _Lazarus_, Marys air, \x22Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had
                        not died,\x22 recalls something of Glucks _Orfeo_ in its heart-broken
                        sadness. And again, in the same oratorio, when Jesus gives the order to
                        raise the stone from the tomb, Marthas speech, \x22Domine, jam foetet,\x22 is
                        very expressive of her sadness, fear, and shame, and human horror. I
                        should like to quote one more passage, the most moving of all, which is
                        found in the _Resurrection of Christ_, when Mary Magdalene is beside the
                        tomb of Christ; here, in her speech with the angels, in her touching
                        lamentation, and in the words of the Evangelist, \x22And when she had thus
                        said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that
                        it was Jesus,\x22 we hear a melody filled with tenderness, and seem to see
                        Christs eyes shining as they rest on Mary before she has recognised
                        Him.
                        [Footnote 91: Jacques Passy notes that with Berlioz the most frequent
                        phrases consist of twelve, sixteen, eighteen, or twenty bars. With
                        Wagner, phrases of eight bars are rare, those of four more common, those
                        of two still more so, while those of one bar are most frequent of all

  communication_note: "The advantage to Verdi of his trips through Europe and to England is
                        shown in \x22Rigoletto,\x22 brought out in Vienna in 1851. In this opera
                        his true power manifests itself. The music shows great advance in
                        declamation, which lifts it above the ordinary Italian style of that
                        time. With this opera Verdis second period begins. Two years later
                        \x22Trovatore\x22 was produced in Rome and had a tremendous success.
                        Each scene brought down thunders of applause, until the very walls
                        resounded and outside people took up the cry, \x22Long live Verdi,
                        Italys greatest composer! Vive Verdi!\x22 It was given in Paris in 1854,
                        and in London the following year. In 1855, \x22La Traviata\x22 was produced
                        in Vienna. This work, so filled with delicate, beautiful music, nearly
                        proved a failure, because the consumptive heroine, who expires on the
                        stage, was sung by a prima donna of such extraordinary stoutness that
                        the scene was received with shouts of laughter. After a number of
                        unsuccessful operas, \x22Un Ballo in Maschera\x22 scored a success in Rome
                        in 1859, and \x22La Forza del Destino,\x22 written for Petrograd, had a
                        recent revival in New York.

                        Soon more ambitious attempts at composition were made, the aim being
                        to write little operas. But unless they could be performed, it was
                        useless to try and make operas. This was a serious difficulty; but
                        Felix was deeply in earnest in whatever he undertook, and decided he
                        must have an orchestra to try out his operatic efforts. It looked like
                        an impossibility, but love and money can accomplish wonders. A small
                        orchestra was duly selected from among the members of the Court band.
                        The lad Felix was to conduct these sedate musicians, which he did
                        modestly but without embarrassment, standing on a footstool before
                        his men, waving the baton like a little general. Before the first
                        performance was quite ready, Felix felt there must be some one present
                        who could really judge of the merits of his little piece. Who would
                        do so better than his old professor of thorough bass and composition,
                        Carl Zelter, the director of the Berlin Singakademie. Zelter agreed
                        to accept this delicate office, and a large number of friends were
                        invited for the occasion.
                        Mr. Stokowskis doings of the last few years can no longer be classed
                        as minor-league musical sensations. They have become Hot Hollywood
                        Stuff. First, there was his appearance in films. Then his
                        collaboration with Mickey Mouse. Then his friendship with Greta Garbo.
                        Then his five-month sentimental journey over half of Europe with the
                        Duse of the screen. Today he is as big a feature of the fan magazines
                        as Clark Gable and Robert Taylor."

  communication_note: "Weber had many kind, influential friends in Prague, who admired his
                        zeal and efficiency as music director. One of them, Count Vitzhum, did
                        all he could to secure Weber for Dresden. On Christmas morning, 1816,
                        he received the appointment. He wrote to Caroline: \x22Long did I look on
                        Count Vitzhums letter without daring to open it. Did it contain joy
                        or sorrow? At length I took courage and broke the seal. It was joy!
                        I am Capellmeister to his Majesty the King of Saxony. I must now rig
                        myself out in true Court style. Perhaps I ought to wear a pigtail to
                        please the Dresdeners. What do you say? I ought at least to have an
                        extra kiss from you for this good news.\x22
                        \x22An artist should practise Hope; for he can expect nothing from the
                        present; he knows that his mission is to _serve_, and to give his
                        work for the life and teaching of the generations that shall come
                        after him.
                        \x22I am for free music. Yes, I want music to be proudly free, to be
                        victorious, to be supreme. I want her to take all she can, so that
                        there may be no more Alps or Pyrenees for her. But she must
                        achieve her victories by fighting in person, and not rely upon her
                        lieutenants. I should like her to have, if possible, good verse
                        drawn up in order of battle; but, like Napoleon, she must face the
                        fire herself, and, like Alexander, march in the front ranks of the
                        phalanx. She is so powerful that in some cases she would conquer
                        unaided; for she has the right to say with Medea: I, myself, am
                        enough.\x22"

  communication_note: "We can trace impressions of early life in Debussys music, through his
                        employment of the old modes, the bell sounds which were familiar to
                        his boyhood, and also circumstances connected with his later life.
                        As a student in Rome, he threw himself into the study of the music
                        of Russian composers, especially that of Moussorgsky; marks of the
                        Oriental coloring derived from these masters appear in his own later
                        music. When he returned to Paris for good, he reflected in music the
                        atmosphere of his environment. By interest and temperament he was
                        in sympathy with the impressionistic school in art, whether it be in
                        painting, literature or in music. In Debussys music the qualities of
                        impressionism and symbolism are very prominent. He employs sounds as
                        though they were colors, and blends them in such a way as literally to
                        paint a picture in tones, through a series of shaded, many-hued chord
                        progressions. Fluid, flexible, vivid, these beautiful harmonies,
                        seemingly woven of refracted rays of light, merge into shadowy melody,
                        and free, flowing rhythm."

  communication_note: "One day when the boy was seven years old, the father was about to
                        start for the castle of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, to see his son,
                        a stepbrother of George, who was a _valet de chambre_ to the Duke.
                        Little George begged to go too, for he knew there was music to be
                        heard at the castle. In spite of his fathers refusal he made up his
                        mind to go if he had to run every step of the way. So watching his
                        chance, he started to run after the coach in which his father rode.
                        The child had no idea it was a distance of forty miles. He strove
                        bravely to keep pace with the horses, but the roads were rough and
                        muddy. His strength beginning to fail, he called out to the coachman
                        to stop. His father, hearing the boys voice looked out of the window.
                        Instead of scolding the little scamp roundly, he was touched by his
                        woebegone appearance, had him lifted into the coach and carried on to
                        Weissenfels."

  communication_note: "As Debussys art only attempts to give the impression of the moment,
                        without troubling itself with what may come after, it is free from care,
                        and takes its fill in the enjoyment of the moment. In the garden of
                        harmonies it selects the most beautiful flowers; for sincerity of
                        expression takes a second place with it, and its first idea is to
                        please. In this again it interprets the aesthetic sensualism of the
                        French race, which seeks pleasure in art, and does not willingly admit
                        ugliness, even when it seems to be justified by the needs of the drama
                        and of truth. Mozart shared the same thought: \x22Music,\x22 he said, \x22even in
                        the most terrible situations, ought never to offend the ear; it should
                        charm it even there; and, in short, always remain music.\x22"

  communication_note: "His _Fifth Symphony_, which he conducted at Strasburg, convinced me,
                        more than all his other works, of the urgent necessity of adopting this
                        course. In this composition he has not allowed himself the use of the
                        choruses, which were one of the chief attractions of his preceding
                        symphonies. He wished to prove that he could write pure music, and to
                        make his claim surer he refused to have any explanation of his
                        composition published in the concert programme, as the other composers
                        in the festival had done; he wished it, therefore, to be judged from a
                        strictly musical point of view. It was a dangerous ordeal for him.
                        At Oxford, in July, he received the honorary degree of Doctor of
                        Music, and three great concerts were given in his honor, with special
                        performers brought from London. In fact the whole visit to England had
                        been such a success that he repeated the trip in 1794, and received
                        even greater honors. His symphonies were heard on all London
                        programs. He was the lion of the season, and was frequently invited to
                        Buckingham Palace to play for the King and Queen, who always urged
                        him to live in England. Haydn was now sixty-five; he had composed
                        quantities of music, but his greatest work, \x22The Creation,\x22 was not
                        yet written. While in London, Salomon had shown him a poem founded on
                        \x22Paradise Lost,\x22 written years before in the hope that Handel would
                        use it for an oratorio. Haydn decided to try his hand at oratorio on
                        this subject. As he went on, it grew to be a labor of love and prayer.
                        It was finished and performed in Vienna, March 19, 1799, and made
                        a profound impression. The composer at once began work on a second
                        oratorio, founded on Thompsons \x22Seasons.\x22 The desire for work was
                        strong within, but his health was failing. \x22The Seasons gave me my
                        finishing stroke,\x22 he often remarked to friends.
                        What strikes one also in the _Lieder_ is the importance of the
                        pianoforte accompaniment and its independence of the voice. Sometimes
                        the voice and the pianoforte express the contrast that so often exists
                        between the words and the thought of the poem; at other times they
                        express two personalities, as in his setting of Goethes _Prometheus_,
                        where the accompaniment represents Zeus sending out his thunderbolts,
                        and the voice interprets Titan; or again, he may depict, as in the
                        setting of Eichendorffs _Serenade_, a student in love in the
                        accompaniment, while the song is the voice of an old man who is
                        listening to it and thinking of his youth. But in whatever he is
                        describing, the pianoforte and the voice have always their own
                        individuality. You cannot take anything away from his _Lieder_ without
                        spoiling the whole; and it is especially so with his instrumental
                        passages, which give us the beginning and end of his emotion, and which
                        circle round it and sum it up. The musical form, following closely the
                        poetic form, is extremely varied. It may sometimes express a fugitive
                        thought, a brief record of a poetic impression or some little action, or
                        it may be a great epic or dramatic picture. Mueller remarks that Wolf put
                        more into a poem than the poet himself--as in the
                        _Italienisches-Liederbuch_. It is the worst reproach they can make about
                        him, and it is not an ordinary one. Wolf excelled especially in setting
                        poems which accorded with his own tragic fate, as if he had some
                        presentiment of it. No one has better expressed the anguish of a
                        troubled and despairing soul, such as we find in the old harp-player in
                        _Wilhelm Meister_, or the splendid nihility of certain poems of
                        Michelangelo.
                        Mottl and the composer, Adalbert de Goldschmidt, were the first friends
                        to aid him in his years of misery, by finding him some music pupils. He
                        taught music to little children of seven and eight years old; but he was
                        a poor teacher, and found giving lessons was a martyrdom. The money he
                        earned hardly served to feed him, and he only ate once a day--Heaven
                        knows how. To comfort himself he read Hebbels Life; and for a time he
                        thought of going to America. In 1881 Goldschmidt got him the post of
                        second _Kapellmeister_ at the Salzburg theatre. It was his business to
                        rehearse the choruses for the operettas of Strauss and Milloecker. He did
                        his work conscientiously, but in deadly weariness; and he lacked the
                        necessary power of making his authority felt. He did not stay long in
                        this post, and came back to Vienna."

                        I have tried to unearth M. dIndys strongest characteristics, and I
                        think I have found them in his faith and in his activity, I am only too
                        aware of the pitfalls that have beset me in this attempt; it is always
                        difficult to criticise a mans personality, and it is most difficult
                        when he is alive and still in the midst of his development. Every man is
                        a mystery, not only to others, but to himself. There is something very
                        presumptuous about pretending to know anyone who does not quite know
                        himself. And yet one cannot live without forming opinions; it is a
                        necessity of life. The people we see and know (or say we know), our
                        friends, and those we love, are never what we think them. Often they are
                        not at all like the portrait we conjure up; for we walk among the
                        phantoms of our hearts. But still one must go on having opinions, and go
                        on constructing and creating things, if we do not want to become
                        impotent through inertia. Error is better than doubt, provided we err in
                        good faith; and the main thing is to speak out the thing that one really
                        feels and believes. I hope M. dIndy will forgive me if I have gone far
                        wrong, and that he will see in these pages a sincere effort to
                        understand him and a keen sympathy with himself, and even with his
                        ideas, though I do not always share them. But I have always thought that
                        in life a mans opinions go for very little, and that the only thing
                        that matters is the man himself. Freedom of spirit is the greatest
                        happiness one can know; one must be sorry for those who have not got it.
                        And there is a secret pleasure in rendering homage to anothers splendid
                        creed, even though it is one that we do not ourselves profess."

                        One morning, early in the year 1837, Liszt called on his brother
                        artist and found him in good spirits over some new compositions. He
                        wished to play them to some friends, so it was arranged that a party
                        of them should come to his rooms that evening. Liszt came with his
                        special friend, Mme. dAgoult and George Sand. Afterwards these
                        meetings were frequently repeated. Liszt poetically describes one such
                        evening, in his \x22Life of Chopin.\x22
                        In spite of the changes of taste and the campaign of the press, the
                        Opera has remained to this day as it was in the time of Meyerbeer and
                        Gounod and their disciples. But it would be foolish to pretend that it
                        has not its public. The receipts show well enough that _Faust_ is in
                        greater favour than _Siegfried_ or _Tristan_, not to speak of the more
                        recent works of the new French school, which cannot be acclimatised
                        there.
                        The lesson began, and the little girl showed both quickness and
                        patience to grasp the ideas. No one at first noticed the tiny child
                        who planted himself at his sisters elbow, the light of the candles
                        falling on his delicate, sensitive features and bright brown hair. His
                        glance never left Nannerls fingers as they felt hesitatingly
                        among the white and black keys, while his ear easily understood the
                        intervals she tried to play."

                        to visit that land of song was within his grasp. At the age of
                        twenty-four, in the year 1738, Gluck bade adieu to his many kind
                        friends in Vienna, and set out to complete his studies in Italy. Milan
                        was his objective point. Soon after arriving there he had the good
                        fortune to meet Padre Martini, the celebrated master of musical
                        theory. Young Gluck at once placed himself under the great mans
                        guidance and labored diligently with him for about four years. How
                        much he owed to the careful training Martini was able to give, was
                        seen in even his first attempts at operatic composition.

                        predecessors. Much of their soul has passed into his. His style is made
                        up of all styles, and ranges from the Gregorian chant to the most modern
                        modulations. All available materials are used in this work. This is an
                        Italian characteristic. Gabriel dAnnunzio threw into his melting-pot
                        the Renaissance, the Italian painters, music, the writers of the North,
                        Tolstoy, Dostoievsky, Maeterlinck, and our French writers, and out of it
                        he drew his wonderful poems. So Don Perosi, in his compositions, welds
                        together the Gregorian chant, the musical style of the contrapuntists of
                        the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Palestrina, Roland, Gabrieli,
                        Carissimi, Schuetz, Bach, Haendel, Gounod, Wagner--I was going to say
                        Cesar Franck, but Don Perosi told me that he hardly knew this composer
                        at all, though his style bears some resemblance to Francks.

                        composer. Verdi showed him some of the same compositions he had shown
                        Basili. After examining them he willingly accepted the young aspirant
                        as a pupil."

                        have not a place in our public life? Why are they not part of our great
                        ceremonies? That is what one would wonderingly ask oneself if one had
                        not seen, for the last century, the indifference of the State to Art.
                        What might not Berlioz have done if the means had been given him, or if
                        his works had found a place in the fetes of the Revolution? Unhappily,
                        one must add that here again his character was the enemy of his genius.
                        As this apostle of musical freedom, in the second part of his life,
                        became afraid of himself and recoiled before the results of his own
                        principles, and returned to classicism, so this revolutionary fell to
                        sullenly disparaging the people and revolutions; and he talks about \x22the
                        republican cholera,\x22 \x22the dirty and stupid republic,\x22 \x22the republic of
                        street-porters and rag-gatherers,\x22 \x22the filthy rabble of humanity a
                        hundred times more stupid and animal in its twitchings and revolutionary

                        In 1717, on his return from Dresden, Bach was appointed Capellmeister
                        to the young Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cethen. The Prince was an
                        enthusiastic lover of music, and at Cethen Bach led a happy, busy
                        life. The Prince often journeyed to different towns to gratify his
                        taste for music, and always took Bach with him. On one of these trips
                        he was unable to receive the news that his wife had suddenly passed
                        away, and was buried before he could return to Cethen. This was a
                        severe blow to the whole family.
                        The success of _Pelleas et Melisande_ is due to many things. Some of
                        them are trivial, such as fashion, which has certainly played its part
                        here as it has in all other successes, though it is a relatively weak
                        part; some of them are more important, and arise from something innate
                        in the spirit of French genius; and there are also moral and aesthetic
                        reasons for its success, and, in the widest sense, purely musical
                        reasons."

  communication_note: "Such was his life, cut short at thirty-seven years of age--for one
                        cannot count the five years of complete madness. There are not many
                        examples in the art world of so terrible a fate. Nietzsches misfortune
                        is nowhere beside this, for Nietzsches madness was, to a certain
                        extent, productive, and caused his genius to flash out in a way that it
                        never would have done if his mind had been balanced and his health
                        perfect. Wolfs madness meant prostration. But one may see how, even in
                        the space of thirty-seven years, his life was strangely parcelled out.
                        For he did not really begin his creative work until he was twenty-seven
                        years old; and as from 1890 to 1895 he was condemned to five years
                        silence, the sum total of his real life, his productive life, is only
                        four or five years. But in those few years he got more out of life than
                        the greater part of artists do in a long career, and in his work he left
                        the imprint of a personality that no one could forget after once having
                        known it.
                        In 1847, we find Verdi in London, where on July 2, at Her Majestys
                        Theater, \x22I Masnadieri\x22 was brought out, with a cast including
                        Lablanche, Gardoni, Colletti, and above all Jenny Lind, in a part
                        composed expressly for her. All the artists distinguished themselves;
                        Jenny Lind acted admirably and sang her airs exquisitely, but the
                        opera was not a success. No two critics could agree as to its merits.
                        Verdi left England in disgust and took his music to other cities."

  communication_note: "Prince Paul Anton passed away after a year and his brother Nikolaus
                        succeeded him. He advanced Haydn still further, and increased his
                        salary. Werner, the old Capellmeister, died in 1766, and Haydn
                        succeeded to the full title. This was the fathers dream for his boy
                        Josef, and it had been abundantly realized. His mother had passed
                        away, but his father was living, and had come, on one occasion,
                        to Eisenstadt to see him. His brother Michael who had now become
                        Concertmeister in Salzburg, spent several happy days with him also.
                        He now began to prepare for the highest honor, the Prix de Rome. But
                        here parental authority interfered. For some unexplained reason, his
                        father compelled him to leave the Conservatoire before the year was
                        up. It may have been the father desired to see his son become a famous
                        virtuoso pianist and follow the career of Thalberg and Liszt. At any
                        rate he insisted his boy should make the most of his talents as a
                        performer and should also compose certain pieces suitable for public
                        playing. To this period of his life belong many of the compositions
                        for piano solo, the showy caprices, fantaisies and transcriptions.
                        Being obliged to write this kind of music, the young composer sought
                        for new forms in fingering and novel harmonic effects, even in his
                        most insignificant productions. Thus among the early piano works, the
                        Eclogue, Op. 3, and the Ballade, Op. 9, are to be found innovations
                        which should attract the pianist and musician of to-day."

                        not a \x22wonder child,\x22 in the sense that Mozart, Chopin and Liszt were,
                        he early showed his love for music and his rapt enjoyment of the music
                        of the home circle. Fortunately he lived and breathed in a musical
                        atmosphere from his earliest babyhood. His mother was a fine musician
                        and singer herself, and with loving care she fostered the desire for
                        it and the early studies of it in her son. She was his first teacher,
                        for she kept up her own musical studies after her marriage, and
                        continued to appear in concerts in Bergen, where the family lived.
                        Little Edward, one of five children, seemed to inherit the mothers
                        musical talent and had vivid recollections of the rhythmic animation
                        and spirit with which she played the works of Weber, who was one of
                        her favorite composers.
                        He likes reading, listening to the radio--he is fond of good jazz--and
                        driving out in the country. He loves speed. An American friend who
                        some years ago accompanied him on a motor trip from Milan to Venice
                        groaned when the speedometer began hovering around 78. \x22Whats the
                        matter with you?\x22 the Maestro wanted to know. \x22Were only jogging
                        along.\x22 Whenever possible he flies.
                        To secure rest and change, he undertook a trip to London, for the
                        second and last time, arriving April 21, 1848. He played at different
                        great houses and gave two matinees, at the homes of Adelaide Kemble
                        and Lord Falmouth, June 23, and July 7. These were attended by many
                        titled personages. Viardot Garcia sang. The composer was thin, pale,
                        and played with \x22wasted fingers,\x22 but the money helped replenish his
                        depleted purse.
                        It was a time for rapid impressions to sway the ardent temperament of
                        this boy genius of twenty-one. He read the works of Wilhelm Heinse,
                        who depicts both the highest artistic pleasures and those of the
                        opposite sort. Other authors following the same trend made him believe
                        in the utmost freedom in politics, literature and morals. Freedom in
                        everything--the pleasures of the moment--seemed to him the highest
                        good."

                        should reign supreme and make one forget everything else.... In an opera
                        it is absolutely necessary that Poetry should be Musics obedient
                        daughter\x22 (Letter to his father, 13 October, 1781). Despairing probably
                        at being unable to obtain this obedience, Mozart thought seriously of
                        breaking up the form of opera, and of putting in its place, in 1778, a
                        sort of melodrama (of which Rousseau had given an example in 1773),
                        which he called \x22duodrama,\x22 where music and poetry were loosely
                        associated, yet not dependent on each other, but went side by side on
                        two parallel roads (Letter of 12 November, 1778).]
                        Almost as great a linguist as he is a musician, he coaxes and curses

                        One day, as he sat dreaming before his piano, some one knocked at
                        the door, and the next instant in walked his master Raff, of whom the
                        young American stood in great awe. In the course of a few moments,
                        Raff suddenly asked what he had been writing. In his confusion the boy
                        stammered he had been working on a concerto. When Raff started to go,
                        he turned back and told the boy to bring the concerto to him the next
                        Sunday. As even the first movement was not finished, its author set to
                        work with vigor. When Sunday came only the first movement was ready.
                        Postponing the visit a week or two, he had time to complete the work,
                        which stands today, as he wrote it then, with scarcely a correction."

                        lover of freedom, and had shaken off traditions and pedantry, and
                        scorned German routine; and he liked him, too, because his music was a
                        reaction from the stiff school of Brahms.[131] He was enthusiastic about
                        Liszts work, and was one of the earliest and most ardent champions of
                        that new music of which Liszt was the leading spirit--of that
                        \x22programme\x22 music which Wagners triumph seemed to have nipped in the
                        bud, but which has suddenly and gloriously burst into life again in the
                        works of Richard Strauss. \x22Liszt is one of the great composers of our
                        time,\x22 wrote M. Saint-Saens; \x22he has dared more than either Weber, or
                        Mendelssohn, or Schubert, or Schumann. He has created the symphonic
                        poem. He is the deliverer of instrumental music.... He has proclaimed
                        the reign of free music.\x22[132] This was not said impulsively in a moment
                        of enthusiasm; M. Saint-Saens has always held this opinion. All his life
                        he has remained faithful to his admiration of Liszt--since 1858, when he
                        dedicated a _Veni Creator_ to \x22the Abbe Liszt,\x22 until 1886, when, a few
                        months after Liszts death, he dedicated his masterpiece, the _Symphonic
                        avec orgue_, \x22To the memory of Franz Liszt.\x22[133]
                        Then a pupil of Francks, M. Henry Expert, who began his admirable works
                        on Musical History in 1882, laid the foundation of the _Societe J.S.
                        Bach_, in order to spread the knowledge of ancient music written between
                        the twelfth and eighteenth centuries. And he succeeded in interesting
                        in his undertaking, not only the principal French musicians, such as
                        Cesar Franck, Saint-Saens, and Gounod, but also foreigners, such as Hans
                        von Buelow, Tschaikowsky, Grieg, Sgambati, and Gevaert. Unhappily this
                        society never got farther than arranging what it wanted to do, and only
                        sketched out the plans that were realised later by Charles Bordes.
                        From the rocky heights on which their town was built, the people
                        of Palestrina could look across the Campagna--the great plain
                        between--and see the walls and towers of Rome. At the time of our
                        story, Saint Peters had withstood the sack of the city, which
                        happened a dozen years before, and Bramantes vast basilica had
                        already begun to rise. The artistic life of Rome was still at high
                        tide, for Raphael had passed away but twenty years before, and Michael
                        Angelo was at work on his Last Judgment.
                        I am far from thinking that the symphony is without a fault. The themes
                        are of unequal value: some are quite commonplace; and, in a general way,
                        the working up of the composition is superior to its underlying
                        thought. I shall come back later on to certain faults in Strausss
                        music; here I only want to consider the overflowing life and feverish
                        joy that set these worlds spinning."

  communication_note: "After three years hard work his teacher told him he must seek another
                        master, as he could teach him nothing more. So the boy was sent to
                        Berlin, to continue his studies. Two of the prominent musicians there
                        were Ariosti and Buononcini; the former received the boy kindly and
                        gave him great encouragement; the other took a dislike to the little
                        fellow, and tried to injure him. Pretending to test his musicianship,
                        Buononcini composed a very difficult piece for the harpsichord
                        and asked him to play it at sight. This the boy did with ease and
                        correctness. The Elector was delighted with the little musician,
                        offered him a place at Court and even promised to send him to Italy
                        to pursue his studies. Both offers were refused and George returned to
                        Halle and to his old master, who was happy to have him back once more.
                        During the season of 1833 and 1834, Chopin continued to make his way
                        as composer, pianist and teacher. A letter to friends in Poland, says:
                        \x22Frederic looks well and strong; he turns the heads of all the French
                        women, and makes the men jealous. He is now the fashion.\x22
                        It needed a complete upheaval of the nation--a political and moral
                        upheaval--to change that frame of mind. Some indication of the change
                        was making itself felt in the last years of the second Empire. Wagner,
                        who suffered from the hostility or indifference of the public in 1860,
                        at the time when _Tannhaeuser_ was performed at the Opera, had already
                        found, however, a few understanding people in Paris who discerned his
                        genius and sincerely admired him. The most interesting of the writers
                        who first began to understand musical emotion is Charles Baudelaire. In
                        1861, Pasdeloup gave the first _Concerts populaires de musique
                        classique_ at the Cirque dHiver. The Berlioz Festival, organised by M.
                        Reyer, on March 23rd, 1870, a year after Berliozs death, revealed to
                        France the grandeur of its greatest musical genius, and was the
                        beginning of a campaign of public reparation to his memory."

                        his pupil Miss Jane Stirling, to whom he dedicated the two Nocturnes,
                        Op. 55. He played in Manchester, August 28; his playing was rather
                        weak, but retained all its elegance, finish and grace. He was encored
                        for his familiar Mazurka, Op. 7, No. 1, and repeated it with quite
                        different nuances. One survivor of this audience remarked subsequently
                        in a letter to a friend: \x22My emotion was so great I was compelled to
                        retire to recover myself. I have heard all the celebrated stars of
                        the musical firmament, but never has one left such an impression on my
                        mind.\x22
                        The action takes place in the thirteenth century, in Germany. The first
                        act gives us a glade near a little lake. The country people are in
                        revolt against the nobles, and have just been repulsed. Guntram and his
                        master Friedhold distribute alms among them, and the band of defeated
                        men then take flight into the woods. Left alone, Guntram begins to muse
                        on the delights of springtime and the innocent awakening of Nature. But
                        the thought of the misery that its beauty hides weighs upon him. He
                        thinks of mens evil doing, of human suffering, and of civil war. He
                        gives thanks to Christ for having led him to this unhappy country,
                        kisses the cross, and decides to go to the court of the tyrant who is
                        the cause of all the trouble, and make known to him the Divine
                        revelation. At that moment Freihild appears. She is the wife of Duke
                        Robert, who is the cruellest of all the nobles, and she is horrified by
                        all that is happening around her; life seems hateful to her, and she
                        wishes to drown herself. But Guntram prevents her; and the pity that her
                        beauty and trouble had at first aroused changes unconsciously into love
                        when he recognises her as the beloved princess and sole benefactress of
                        the unhappy people. He tells her that God has sent him to her for her
                        salvation. Then he goes to the castle, where he believes himself to be
                        sent on the double mission of saving the people--and Freihild.
                        We are told that Frau Schumann, Joachim and Stockhausen came
                        frequently to Hamburg during the season of 1861, and all three made
                        much of Johannes. All four gave concerts together, and Johannes took
                        part in a performance of Schumanns beautiful Andante and Variations,
                        for two pianos, while Stockhausen sang entrancingly Beethovens
                        Love Songs, accompanied by Brahms. On one occasion Brahms played his
                        Variations on a Handel Theme, \x22another magnificent work, splendidly
                        long, the stream of ideas flowing inexhaustibly. And the work was
                        wonderfully played by the composer; it seemed like a miracle. The
                        composition is so difficult that none but a great artist can attempt
                        it.\x22 So wrote a listener at the time. That was in 1861. We know this
                        wonderful work in these days, for all the present time artists perform
                        it. At each of Frau Schumanns three appearances in Hamburg during the
                        autumn of this year, she performed one of Brahms larger compositions;
                        one of them was the Handel Variations.
                        He was born at Kalischt in Bohemia, and became a pupil of Anton
                        Bruckner at Vienna, and afterwards _Hofoperndirecktor_ (\x22Director of the
                        Opera\x22) there. I hope one day to study this artists work in greater
                        detail, for he is second only to Strauss as a composer in Germany, and
                        the principal musician of South Germany."

  communication_note: "The year 1874, was full of varied excitement. Many invitations
                        were accepted to conduct his works in North Germany, the Rhine,
                        Switzerland, and other countries. A tour in Holland in 1876, brought
                        real joy. He played his D minor Concerto in Utrecht and other cities,
                        conducted his works and was everywhere received with honors. But the
                        greatest event of this year was the appearance of his first Symphony.
                        It was performed for the first time from manuscript in Carlsruhe and
                        later in many other cities. In this work \x22Brahms close affinity with
                        Beethoven must become clear to every musician, who has not already
                        perceived it,\x22 wrote Hanslick, the noted critic.
                        Strauss has directed Wagners dramas at Weimar since 1889. While
                        breathing their atmosphere he turned his attention to the theatre, and
                        wrote the libretto of his opera _Guntram_. Illness interrupted his work,
                        and he was in Egypt when he took it up again. The music of the first act
                        was written between December, 1892, and February, 1893, while travelling
                        between Cairo and Luxor; the second act was finished in June, 1893, in
                        Sicily; and the third act early in September, 1893, in Bavaria. There
                        is, however, no trace of an oriental atmosphere in this music. We find
                        rather the melodies of Italy, the reflection of a mellow light, and a
                        resigned calm. I feel in it the languid mind of the convalescent, almost
                        the heart of a young girl whose tears are ready to flow, though she is
                        smiling a little at her own sad dreams. It seems to me that Strauss must
                        have a secret affection for this work, which owes its inspiration to
                        the undefinable impressions of convalescence. His fever fell asleep in
                        it, and certain passages are full of the caressing touch of nature, and
                        recall Berliozs _Les Troyens_. But too often the music is superficial
                        and conventional, and the tyranny of Wagner makes itself felt--a rare
                        enough occurrence in Strausss other works. The poem is interesting;
                        Strauss has put much of himself into it, and one is conscious of the
                        crisis that unsettled his broad-minded but often self-satisfied and
                        inconsistent ideas."

                        toward making Weimar the first musical city of Germany. Greatly
                        admiring Wagners genius, he undertook to perform his works in Weimar,
                        and to spread his name and fame. Indeed it is not too much to say that
                        without Liszts devoted efforts, Wagner would never have attained his
                        vogue and fame. Wagner himself testified to this.
                        It was a time for rapid impressions to sway the ardent temperament of
                        this boy genius of twenty-one. He read the works of Wilhelm Heinse,

                        opposite sort. Other authors following the same trend made him believe
                        in the utmost freedom in politics, literature and morals. Freedom in
                        everything--the pleasures of the moment--seemed to him the highest

  communication_note: "The official programme of the _fetes musicales_ laid stress on the
                        reconciliatory purpose of its organisers, and I quote these words from
                        the programme book, drawn up by Dr. Max Bendiner, of Strasburg:
                        It is not my intention here to write an appreciation of Cesar Francks
                        genius, but it is not possible to understand the musical movement in
                        Paris of the last fifteen years if one does not take into account the
                        importance of his teaching. The organ class at the Conservatoire, where
                        in 1872 Franck succeeded his old master Benoist, was for a long time, as
                        M. Vincent dIndy says, \x22the true centre for the study of Composition
                        at the Conservatoire. Many of his fellow-workers could never bring
                        themselves to look upon him as one of themselves, because he had the
                        boldness to see in art something other than the means of earning a
                        living. Indeed, Cesar Franck was not of them; and they made him feel
                        this.\x22 But the young students made no mistake about the matter. \x22At this
                        time,\x22 M. dIndy also tells us,[222] \x22that is to say from 1872 to 1876,
                        the three courses of Advanced Musical Composition were given by three
                        professors who were not at all fitted for their work. One was Victor
                        Masse, a composer of simple light operas and a man with no understanding
                        of a symphony, who was very frequently ill and had to entrust his
                        teaching to one of his pupils; another was Henri Reber, an oldish
                        musician with narrow and dogmatic ideas; and the third was Francois
                        Bazin, who was not capable of distinguishing in his pupils fugues a
                        false answer from a true one, and whose highest title to glory is
                        derived from a composition called _Le Voyage en Chine_. So it is not
                        surprising that Cesar Francks teaching, founded on that of Bach and
                        Beethoven, but admitting, as well, imagination and all new and liberal
                        ideas, did, at that time, draw to him all young minds that had lofty
                        ambitions and that were really in love with their art. And so, quite
                        unconsciously, the master attracted to himself all the sincere and
                        artistic talent that was scattered about the different classes of the
                        Conservatoire, as well as that of his outside pupils.\x22
                        \x22An artist should be inspired by a splendid Charity--the greatest
                        of these. To _love_ should be his aim in life; for the moving
                        principle of all creation is divine and charitable Love.\x22"

  communication_note: "The boy soon found plenty to fill his time and occupy his mind. There
                        was the school orchestra, in which he was able to take a prominent
                        place. There was daily practise, in which the boys learned the
                        overtures and symphonies of Mozart and Haydn, and even Beethoven. He
                        loved best Mozarts \x22Symphony in G minor,\x22 in which he said he heard
                        angels singing. The leader of the orchestra was attracted to the
                        lads playing the very first day he entered, for he played with such
                        precision and understanding. One day Franz mustered courage to talk
                        a little to the big conductor, whose name was Spaun, and confessed he
                        had composed quite a good deal already, adding he would like to do
                        it every day, only he could not afford to get the music paper. Spaun
                        received this burst of confidence with sympathy, and saw to it that
                        the boy was, in the future, supplied with the necessary music paper.
                        The progress of musical criticism was just as rapid. Professors of
                        faculties, old pupils of the Ecole Normale Superieure, or the Ecole des
                        Chartes, such as Henri Lichtenberger, Louis Laloy, and Pierre Aubrey,
                        examined works of the past, and even of the present, by the exact
                        methods of historical criticism. Choir-masters and organists of great
                        erudition, such as Andre Pirro and Gastoue, and composers like Vincent
                        dIndy, Dukas, Debussy, and some others, analysed their art with the
                        confidence that the intimate knowledge of its practice brings. A
                        perfect efflorescence of works on music appeared. A galaxy of
                        distinguished writers and a public were found to support two separate
                        collections of Biographies of Musicians (which were issued at the same
                        time by different publishers), as well as five or six good musical
                        journals of a scientific character, some of which rivalled the best in
                        Germany. And, finally, the French section of the _Societe Internationale
                        de Musique_, which was founded in 1899 in Berlin to establish
                        communication between the scholars of all countries, found so favourable
                        a ground with us that the number of its adherents in Paris alone is now
                        over one hundred.
                        On the arrival of Piccini, Madame du Barry began activities, aided by
                        Louis XV himself. She gathered a powerful Italian party about her,
                        and their first act was to induce the Grand Opera management to make
                        Piccini an offer for a new opera, although they had already made the
                        same offer to Gluck. This breach of good faith led to a furious war,
                        in which all Paris joined; it was fierce and bitter while it lasted.
                        Even politics were forgotten for the time being. Part of the press
                        took up one side and part the other. Many pamphlets, poems and satires
                        appeared, in which both composers were unmercifully attacked. Gluck
                        was at the time in Germany, and Piccini had come to Paris principally
                        to secure the tempting fee offered him. The leaders of the feud kept
                        things well stirred up, so that a stranger could not enter a cafe,
                        hotel or theater without first answering the question whether he stood
                        for Gluck or Piccini. Many foolish lies were told of Gluck in his
                        absence. It was declared by the Piccinists that he went away on
                        purpose, to escape the war; that he could no longer write melodies
                        because he was a dried up old man and had nothing new to give France.
                        These lies and false stories were put to flight one evening when the
                        Abbe Arnaud, one of Glucks most ardent adherents, declared in an
                        aristocratic company, that the Chevalier was returning to France with
                        an \x22Orlando\x22 and an \x22Armide\x22 in his portfolio.
                        In 1884 he succeeded in getting a post as musical critic. But on what a
                        paper! It was the _Salonblatt_--a mundane journal filled with articles
                        on sport and fashion news. One would have said that this little
                        barbarian was put there for a wager. His articles from 1884 to 1887 are
                        full of life and humour. He upholds the great classic masters in them:
                        Gluck, Mozart, Beethoven, and--Wagner; he defends Berlioz; he scourges
                        the modern Italians, whose success at Vienna was simply scandalous; he
                        breaks lances for Bruckner, and begins a bold campaign against Brahms.
                        It was not that he disliked or had any prejudice against Brahms; he took
                        a delight in some of his works, especially his chamber music, but he
                        found fault with his symphonies and was shocked by the carelessness of
                        the declamation in his _Lieder_ and, in general, could not bear his want
                        of originality and power, and found him lacking in joy and fulness of
                        life. Above all, he struck at him as being the head of a party that was
                        spitefully opposed to Wagner and Bruckner and all innovators. For all
                        that was retrograde in music in Vienna, and all that was the enemy of
                        liberty and progress in art and criticism, was giving Brahms its
                        detestable support by gathering itself about him and spreading his fame
                        abroad; and though Brahms was really far above his party as an artist
                        and a man, he had not the courage to break away from it."

                        the most stirring of Strausss works, and the one that is conceived with
                        the most perfect unity. It was inspired by a poem of Alexander Ritters,
                        and I will give you an idea of its subject.
                        In reality, it was not against _Siegfried_ itself that Tolstoys
                        criticism was directed; and Tolstoy was closer than he thought to the
                        spirit of this drama. Is not Siegfried the heroic incarnation of a free
                        and healthy man, sprung directly from Nature? In a sketch of
                        _Siegfried_, written in 1848, Wagner says:
                        \x22The next scene represented a forest. Wotan was waking up the
                        dragon. At first the dragon said, I want to go to sleep; but
                        eventually he came out of his grotto. The dragon was represented by
                        two men clothed in a green skin with some scales stuck about it. At
                        one end of the skin they wagged a tail, and at the other end they
                        opened a crocodiles mouth, out of which came fire. The dragon,
                        which ought to have been a frightful beast--and perhaps he would
                        have frightened children about five years old--said a few words in
                        a bass voice. It was so childish and feeble that one was astonished
                        to see grown-up people present; even thousands of so-called
                        cultured people looked on and listened attentively, and went into
                        raptures. Then Siegfried arrived with his horn. He lay down during
                        a pause, which is reputed to be very beautiful; and sometimes he
                        talked to himself, and sometimes he was quite silent. He wanted to
                        imitate the song of the birds, and cut a rush with his horn, and
                        made a flute out of it. But he played the flute badly, and so he
                        began to blow his horn. The scene is intolerable, and there is not
                        the least trace of music in it. I was annoyed to see three thousand
                        people round about me, listening submissively to this absurdity
                        and dutifully admiring it.
                        The popular art that he extols is not an art belonging to the people,
                        but that of an aristocracy interested in the people. He wishes to
                        enlighten them, to mould them, to direct them, by means of art. Art is
                        the source of life; it is the spirit of progress; it gives the most
                        precious of possessions to the soul--liberty. And no one enjoys this
                        liberty more than the artist. In a lecture to the _Schola_ he said:"

                        In the old Lichtenthal quarter of the city of Vienna, in the vicinity
                        of the fortifications, there still stands an old house. It is
                        evidently a public house, for there hangs the sign--\x22At the Red Crab.\x22
                        Beside this there is a marble tablet fastened above the doorway, which
                        says that Franz Schubert was born in this house. At the right of his
                        name is placed a lyre crowned with a star, and at the left a laurel
                        wreath within which is placed the date, January 31, 1797.
                        Fifteen leagues south of Vienna, amid marshy flats along the river
                        Leitha, lies the small village of Rehrau. At the end of the straggling
                        street which constitutes the village, stood a low thatched cottage
                        and next to it a wheelwrights shop, with a small patch of greensward
                        before it. The master wheelwright, Mathias Haydn, was sexton, too, of
                        the little church on the hill. He was a worthy man and very religious.
                        A deep love for music was part of the mans nature, and it was shared
                        to a large extent by his wife Maria. Every Sunday evening he would
                        bring out his harp, on which he had taught himself to play, and he
                        and his wife would sing songs and hymns, accompanied by the harp. The
                        children, too, would add their voices to the concert. The little
                        boy Josef, sat near his father and watched his playing with rapt
                        attention. Sometimes he would take two sticks and make believe play
                        the violin, just as he had seen the village schoolmaster do. And
                        when he sang hymns with the others, his voice was sweet and true. The
                        father watched the child with interest, and a new hope rose within
                        him. His own life had been a bitter disappointment, for he had been
                        unable to satisfy his longing for a knowledge of the art he loved.
                        Perhaps Josef might one day become a musician--indeed he might even
                        rise to be Capellmeister.
                        A new director was now in charge of the Opera House. He conceived the
                        bright idea of setting the two composers at work on the same subject,
                        which was to be \x22Iphigenie en Tauride.\x22 This plan made great commotion
                        in the ranks of the rival factions, as each wished to have their
                        composers work performed first. The director promised that Piccinis
                        opera should be first placed in rehearsal. Gluck soon finished his
                        and handed it in, but the Italian, trusting to the directors word of
                        honor, was not troubled when he heard the news, though he determined
                        to complete his as soon as possible. A few days later, when he went to
                        the Opera House with his completed score, he was horrified to find the
                        work of his rival already in rehearsal. There was a lively scene, but
                        the manager said he had received orders to produce the work of Gluck
                        at once, and he must obey. On the 18th of May, 1779, the Gluck opera
                        was first performed. It produced the greatest excitement and had a
                        marvelous success. Even Piccini succumbed to the spell, for the music
                        made such an impression on him that he did not wish his own work to be
                        brought out."

  communication_note: "The composer who through his music had endeared himself to the whole
                        world, was granted a touching funeral, at which only his own music
                        was heard, including his Funeral March, which he had composed for his
                        friend Nordraak. The burial place is as romantic as his music. Near
                        his home there is a steep cliff, about fifty feet high, projecting
                        into the fjord. Half way up there is a natural grotto, which can only
                        be reached by water. In this spot, chosen by Grieg himself, the urn
                        containing his ashes was deposited some weeks after the funeral. Then
                        the grotto was closed and a stone slab with the words \x22Edward Grieg\x22
                        cut upon it, was cemented in the cliff.
                        Although it was an urgent matter that young French composers should
                        unite to withstand the general indifference of the public, it was more
                        urgent still that that indifference should be attacked, and that music
                        should be brought within reach of ordinary people. It was a matter of
                        taking up and completing Pasdeloups work in a more artistic and more
                        modern spirit.
                        M. dIndy is not a man hedged in by the boundaries of his art; his mind
                        is open and well fertilised. Musicians nowadays are no longer entirely
                        absorbed in their notes, but let their minds go out to other interests.
                        And it is not one of the least interesting phenomena of French music
                        to-day that gives us these learned and thoughtful composers, who are
                        conscious of what they create, and bring to their art a keen critical
                        faculty, like that of M. Saint-Saens, M. Dukas, or M. dIndy. From M.
                        dIndy we have had scholarly editions of Rameau, Destouches, and Salomon
                        de Rossi. Even in the middle of rehearsals of _LEtranger_ at Brussels
                        he was working at a reconstruction of Monteverdes _Orfeo_. He has
                        published selections of folk-songs with critical notes, essays on
                        Beethovens predecessors, a history of Musical Composition, and debates
                        and lectures. This fine intellectual culture is not, however, the most
                        remarkable of M. dIndys characteristics, though it may have been the
                        most remarked. Other musicians share this culture with him; and his real
                        distinction lies in his moral and almost religious qualities, and it is
                        this side of him that gives him an unusual interest for us among other
                        contemporary artists."

  communication_note: "Clearness is the distinguishing quality of M. dIndys mind. There are
                        no shadows about him. His ideas and his art are as clear as the look
                        that gives so much youth to his face. For him to examine, to arrange,
                        to classify, to combine, is a necessity. No one is more French in
                        spirit. He has sometimes been taxed with Wagnerism, and it is true that
                        he has felt Wagners influence very strongly. But even when this
                        influence is most apparent it is only superficial: his true spirit is
                        remote from Wagners. You may find in _Fervaal_ a few trees like those
                        in _Siegfrieds_ forest; but the forest itself is not the same; broad
                        avenues have been cut in it, and daylight fills the caverns of the
                        Niebelungs."

  communication_note: "\x22I often used to wait for him at the Hotel Imperial; and on this
                        occasion I made the acquaintance of the manager of the hotel, who
                        promised that he would interest himself on my behalf. Who was more
                        delighted than I when he told me that on the following Saturday
                        afternoon, 11 December, I was to come and find him, so that he
                        could introduce me to Mme. Cosimas maid and Richard Wagners
                        valet! I arrived at the appointed hour. The visit to the ladys
                        maid was very short. I was advised to come the following day,
                        Sunday, 12 December, at two oclock. I arrived at the right hour,
                        but found the maid and the valet and the manager still at table....
                        Then I went with the maid to the masters rooms, where I waited for
                        about a quarter of an hour until he came. At last Wagner appeared
                        in company with Cosima and Goldmark. I bowed to Cosima very
                        respectfully, but she evidently did not think it worth while to
                        honour me with a single glance. Wagner was going into his room
                        without paying any attention to me, when the maid said to him in a
                        beseeching voice: Ah, Herr Wagner, it is a young musician who
                        wishes to speak to you; he has been waiting for you a long time.
                        In my opinion, _Siegfried_, in spirit and in form, stands alone in
                        Wagners work. It breathes perfect health and happiness, and it
                        overflows with gladness. Only _Die Meistersinger_ rivals it in
                        merriment, though even there one does not find such a nice balance of
                        poetry and music.
                        The great composer was a big man, both physically and mentally. A
                        friend describes his countenance as full of fire; \x22when he smiled it
                        was like the sun bursting out of a black cloud. It was a sudden flash
                        of intelligence, wit and good humor, which illumined his countenance,
                        which I have hardly ever seen in any other.\x22 He could relish a joke,
                        and had a keen sense of humor. Few things outside his work interested
                        him; but he was fond of the theater, and liked to go to picture sales.
                        His fiery temper often led him to explode at trifles. No talking among
                        the listeners could be borne by him while he was conducting. He did
                        not hesitate to visit violent abuse on the heads of those who ventured
                        to speak while he was directing and not even the presence of royalty
                        could restrain his anger."

  communication_note: "It is not my intention here to write an appreciation of Cesar Francks
                        genius, but it is not possible to understand the musical movement in
                        Paris of the last fifteen years if one does not take into account the
                        importance of his teaching. The organ class at the Conservatoire, where
                        in 1872 Franck succeeded his old master Benoist, was for a long time, as
                        M. Vincent dIndy says, \x22the true centre for the study of Composition
                        at the Conservatoire. Many of his fellow-workers could never bring
                        themselves to look upon him as one of themselves, because he had the
                        boldness to see in art something other than the means of earning a
                        living. Indeed, Cesar Franck was not of them; and they made him feel
                        this.\x22 But the young students made no mistake about the matter. \x22At this
                        time,\x22 M. dIndy also tells us,[222] \x22that is to say from 1872 to 1876,
                        the three courses of Advanced Musical Composition were given by three
                        professors who were not at all fitted for their work. One was Victor
                        Masse, a composer of simple light operas and a man with no understanding
                        of a symphony, who was very frequently ill and had to entrust his
                        teaching to one of his pupils; another was Henri Reber, an oldish
                        musician with narrow and dogmatic ideas; and the third was Francois
                        Bazin, who was not capable of distinguishing in his pupils fugues a
                        false answer from a true one, and whose highest title to glory is
                        derived from a composition called _Le Voyage en Chine_. So it is not
                        surprising that Cesar Francks teaching, founded on that of Bach and
                        Beethoven, but admitting, as well, imagination and all new and liberal
                        ideas, did, at that time, draw to him all young minds that had lofty
                        ambitions and that were really in love with their art. And so, quite
                        unconsciously, the master attracted to himself all the sincere and
                        artistic talent that was scattered about the different classes of the
                        Conservatoire, as well as that of his outside pupils.\x22"

                        strongly marked. M. dIndy finishes with the renouncement of a

                        The tests for organ prizes have always been four. First, the
                        accompaniment of a plain chant, chosen for the occasion; second, the
                        performance of an organ piece with pedals; third, the improvising of
                        a fugue; fourth, improvising a piece in sonata form. Both the

                        noticed that the two themes could be combined in such a way that one
                        would set off the other. He set to work, and soon became so absorbed
                        in this interweaving of melodies that the improvisation extended to
                        unaccustomed lengths, which bewildered the examiners and they decided
                        to award nothing to such a tiresome boy. Benoist, teacher of this
                        ingenious pupil, explained matters with the result that Cesar was
                        awarded a second prize for organ.
                        To settle the argument the skeptical friend called the office of
                        the Philharmonic. Mr. Toscanini had been right about the Beethoven
                        Concerto and had correctly remembered the purely orchestral numbers as
                        well.
                        After eighteen busy months in Vienna, father Liszt decided to bring
                        his boy out in a public concert. The Town Hall was placed at his
                        disposal and a number of fine artists assisted. With beaming face and
                        sparkling eyes, the boy played with more skill, fire and confidence
                        than he had ever done before. The concert took place December 1, 1822.
                        On January 12, 1823, Franz repeated his success in another concert,
                        again at the Town Hall."

  communication_note: "Thus passed from sight one of the most astonishing musicians of all
                        time. He lives in his music more vitally than when his bodily presence
                        was on earth, since the world becomes more familiar with his music as
                        time goes on. And to know this music is to admire and love it.
                        The parents were quite willing and as for little Sepperl, he was
                        simply overjoyed, for he longed to learn more about the beautiful
                        music which filled his soul. He went with his new cousin, as he called
                        Frankh, without any hesitation, and with the expectation that his
                        childish day dreams were to be realized.
                        The introduction represents Don Quixote buried in books of chivalrous
                        romance; and we have to see in the music, as we do in little Flemish and
                        Dutch pictures, not only Don Quixotes features, but the words of the
                        books he reads. Sometimes it is the story of a knight who is righting a
                        giant, sometimes the adventures of a knight-errant who has dedicated
                        himself to the services of a lady, sometimes it is a nobleman who has
                        given his life in fulfilment of a vow to atone for his sins. Don
                        Quixotes mind becomes confused (and our own with it) over all these
                        stories; he is quite distracted. He leaves home in company with his
                        squire. The two figures are drawn with great spirit; the one is an old
                        Spaniard, stiff, languishing, distrustful, a bit of a poet, rather
                        undecided in his opinions but obstinate when his mind is once made up;
                        the other is a fat, jovial peasant, a cunning fellow, given to repeating
                        himself in a waggish way and quoting droll proverbs--translated in the
                        music by short-winded phrases that always return to the point they
                        started from. The adventures begin. Here are the windmills (trills from
                        the violins and wood wind), and the bleating army of the grand emperor,
                        Alifanfaron (tremolos from the wood wind); and here, in the third
                        variation, is a dialogue between the knight and his squire, from which
                        we are to guess that Sancho questions his master on the advantages of a
                        chivalrous life, for they seem to him doubtful. Don Quixote talks to him
                        of glory and honour; but Sancho has no thought for it. In reply to these
                        grand words he urges the superiority of sure profits, fat meals, and
                        sounding money. Then the adventures begin again. The two companions fly
                        through the air on wooden horses; and the illusion of this giddy voyage
                        is given by chromatic passages on the flutes, harps, kettledrums, and a
                        \x22windmachine,\x22 while \x22the tremolo of the double basses on the key-note
                        shows that the horses have never left the earth.\x22[177]"

                        The child gazed with awe at the great pipes, the keyboard and the
                        pedals. He begged his father to explain their working, and then as
                        the father filled the great bellows the tiny organist pushed aside
                        the organ bench, stood upon the pedals and trod them, as though he had
                        always known how. The monks in the monastery hastened to the chapel,
                        holding their breath as one pointed to the figure of a tiny child in
                        the organ loft. Was it possible, they asked themselves, that a child
                        could produce such beautiful music? They remained rooted to the spot,
                        till Wolfgang happened to see them and crept meekly down from his
                        perch."

  communication_note: "\x22One should have an aim in the progressive march of modulations, as
                        one has in the different stages of life. The reason, instincts, and
                        faith that guide a man in the troubles of his life also guide the
                        musician in his choice of modulations. Thus useless and
                        contradictory modulations, an undecided balance between light and
                        shade, produce a painful and confusing impression on the hearer,
                        comparable to that which a poor human being inspires when he is
                        feeble and inconsistent, buffeted between the East and the West in
                        the course of his unhappy life, without an aim and without

                        \x22For the last four months I have been suffering from a sort of
                        mental consumption, which makes me very seriously think of quitting
                        this world for ever.... Only those who truly live should live at
                        all. I have been for some time like one who is dead. I only wish it
                        were an apparent death; but I am really dead and buried; though the
                        power to control my body gives me a seeming life. It is my inmost,
                        my only desire, that the flesh may quickly follow the spirit that
                        has already passed. For the last fifteen days I have been living at
                        Traunkirchen, the pearl of Traunsee.... All the comforts that a man
                        could wish for are here to make my life happy--peace, solitude,
                        beautiful scenery, invigorating air, and everything that could suit
                        the tastes of a hermit like myself.[187] And yet--and yet, my
                        friend, I am the most miserable creature on earth. Everything
                        around me breathes peace and happiness, everything throbs with life
                        and fulfils its functions.... I alone, oh God!... I alone live like
                        a beast that is deaf and senseless. Even reading hardly serves to
                        distract me now, though I bury myself in books in my despair. As
                        for composition, that is finished; I can no longer bring to mind
                        the meaning of a harmony or a melody, and I almost begin to doubt
                        if the compositions that bear my name are really mine. Good God!
                        what is the use of all this fame? What is the good of these great
                        aims if misery is all that lies at the end of it?...

                        he composed another cycle of _Lieder_ on poems called _Alten Weisen_, by
                        the great Swiss writer Gottfried Keller. And lastly, in the same year,
                        he began his _Italienisches-Liederbuch_, on Italian poems, translated by
                        Geibel and Heyse."

                        Many years ago this reporter was traveling, as a non-fiddling,
                        non-tooting member of the Philadelphia Orchestra, on a train that
                        carried the organization on one of its Pennsylvania-Maryland-Ohio

                        The work of the early period shows Debussy developing freely and
                        naturally. The independence of his thinking is unmistakable, but it
                        does not run into wilfulness. There is no violent break with the past,
                        but simply the quickening of certain French qualities by the infusion
                        of a new personality. It seemed as if a new and charming miniaturist
                        had appeared, who was doing both for piano and song what had never
                        been done before. The style of the two Arabesques and the more
                        successful of the Ariettes oubliees is perfect. A liberator seemed to
                        have come into music, to take up, half a century later, the work of
                        Chopin--the work of redeeming the art from the excessive objectivity
                        of German thought, of giving it not only a new soul but a new body,
                        swift, lithe and graceful. And that this exquisitely clear, pellucid
                        style could be made to carry out not only gaiety and whimsicality but
                        emotion of a deeper sort, is proved by the lovely \x22Clair de Lune.\x22"

                        the shake was done. Josef after a few trials was able to perform the
                        shake to the entire satisfaction of his teacher. After testing him on
                        a portion of a mass the Capellmeister was willing to take him to the

                        gave a great leap. Vienna, the city of his dreams. And he was really
                        going there! He could scarcely believe in his good fortune. If he
                        could have known all that was to befall him there, he might not have
                        been so eager to go. But he was only a little eight-year-old boy, and

                        But the musical part of _Tristan_ is not free either from the faults of
                        the work as a whole, for it, too, lacks unity. Wagners music is made up
                        of very diverse styles: one finds in it Italianisms and Germanisms and
                        even Gallicisms of every kind; there are some that are sublime, some
                        that are commonplace; and at times one feels the awkwardness of their
                        union and the imperfections of their form. Then again, perhaps two ideas
                        of equal originality come together and spoil each other by making too
                        strong a contrast. The fine lamentation of King Mark--that
                        personification of a knight of the Grail--is treated with such
                        moderation and with so noble a scorn for outward show, that its pure,
                        cold light is entirely lost after the glowing fire of the duet.
                        All the rest of the journey to Vienna, Wolfgang was the life of the
                        party, eager to know the name and history of everything they met. At
                        the custom-house on the frontier, he made friends with the officials
                        by playing for them on his violin, and thus secured an easy pass for
                        the party."

  communication_note: "It was a time for rapid impressions to sway the ardent temperament of
                        this boy genius of twenty-one. He read the works of Wilhelm Heinse,
                        who depicts both the highest artistic pleasures and those of the
                        opposite sort. Other authors following the same trend made him believe
                        in the utmost freedom in politics, literature and morals. Freedom in
                        everything--the pleasures of the moment--seemed to him the highest
                        good.
                        A short time after this, there was a mass at a chapel in Busseto,
                        where the Canon had the service. The organist was unable to attend,
                        and Verdi was called at the last moment to take his place. Very much
                        impressed with the unusually beautiful organ music, the priest, at the
                        close of the service desired to see the organist. His astonishment was
                        great when he saw his scholar whom he had been seeking to turn from
                        the study of music. \x22Whose music did you play?\x22 he asked. \x22It was most
                        beautiful.\x22"

                        of applause, failed to remedy his desperate financial straits. Shortly
                        after this his pupil and patron, Prince Karl Lichnowsky, proposed he
                        should accompany him to Berlin. Mozart gladly consented, hoping for
                        some betterment to his fortunes. The King of Prussia received him
                        with honor and respect and offered him the post of Capellmeister, at
                        a salary equal to about three thousand dollars. This sum would have
                        liberated him from all his financial embarrassments, and he was
                        strongly tempted to accept. But loyalty to his good Emperor Josef
                        caused him to decline the offer.

  communication_note: "One of these new works was \x22The Beatitudes.\x22 For years he had had the
                        longing to compose a religious work on the Sermon on the Mount. In
                        1869, he set to work on the poem, and when that was well under way,
                        began to create, with great ardor, the musical setting.
                        The first act of _Siegfried_ is one of the most dramatic in the
                        Tetralogy. Nothing satisfied me more completely at Bayreuth, both as
                        regards the actors and the dramatic effects. Fantastic creatures like
                        Alberich and Mimi, who seem to be out of their element in France, are
                        rooted deep down in German imaginations. The Bayreuth actors surpassed
                        themselves in making them startlingly lifelike, with a trembling and
                        grimacing realism. Burgstaller, who was then making his debut in
                        _Siegfried_, acted with an impetuous awkwardness which accorded well
                        with the part. I remember with what zest--which seemed in no way
                        affected--he played the hero smith, labouring like a true workman,
                        blowing the fire and making the blade glow, dipping it in the steaming
                        water, and working it on the anvil; and then, in a burst of Homeric
                        gaiety, singing that fine hymn at the end of the first act, which sounds
                        like an air by Bach or Haendel.
                        [Footnote 68: One may judge of this instinct by one fact: he wrote the
                        overtures of _Les Francs-Juges_ and _Waverley_ without really knowing if
                        it were possible to play them. \x22I was so ignorant,\x22 he says, \x22of the
                        mechanism of certain instruments, that after having written the solo in
                        D flat for the trombone in the Introduction of _Les Francs-Juges_, I
                        feared it would be terribly difficult to play. So I went, very anxious,
                        to one of the trombonists of the Opera orchestra. He looked at the
                        passage and reassured me. The key of D flat is, he said, one of the
                        pleasantest for that instrument; and you can count on a splendid effect
                        for that passage\x22 _(Memoires_, I, 63).]
                        The parents listened to their wonder-child with ever increasing
                        astonishment, mingled with tears of emotion. It was plain to be seen
                        that Wolfgang must have lessons as well as Nannerl. And what joy it
                        would be to teach them both."

  communication_note: "While his father lived the boy was sure of sympathy and affection,
                        though circumstances were of the poorest. But the good man passed away
                        when the boy was quite young, and then matters were much worse. He was
                        gradually neglected until he was at last left to shift for himself.
                        \x22The next scene represented a forest. Wotan was waking up the
                        dragon. At first the dragon said, I want to go to sleep; but
                        eventually he came out of his grotto. The dragon was represented by
                        two men clothed in a green skin with some scales stuck about it. At
                        one end of the skin they wagged a tail, and at the other end they
                        opened a crocodiles mouth, out of which came fire. The dragon,
                        which ought to have been a frightful beast--and perhaps he would
                        have frightened children about five years old--said a few words in
                        a bass voice. It was so childish and feeble that one was astonished
                        to see grown-up people present; even thousands of so-called
                        cultured people looked on and listened attentively, and went into
                        raptures. Then Siegfried arrived with his horn. He lay down during
                        a pause, which is reputed to be very beautiful; and sometimes he
                        talked to himself, and sometimes he was quite silent. He wanted to
                        imitate the song of the birds, and cut a rush with his horn, and
                        made a flute out of it. But he played the flute badly, and so he
                        began to blow his horn. The scene is intolerable, and there is not
                        the least trace of music in it. I was annoyed to see three thousand
                        people round about me, listening submissively to this absurdity
                        and dutifully admiring it.

  communication_note: "The same year, in the Eden theatre, to which the concerts had been
                        transferred, Lamoureux conducted, for the first time in Paris, the first
                        act of the _Walkuere_. In these concerts the tenor, Van Dyck, made his
                        _debut_; later, he was one of the leading performers at Bayreuth. In
                        1886-1887 Lamoureux rehearsed and conducted the only performance of
                        _Lohengrin_ at the Eden theatre. Disturbances in the streets prevented
                        further performances. Lamoureux then established himself in the
                        concert-room of the Cirque des Champs Elysees, where for eleven years he
                        has given what are called the _Concerts-Lamoureux_. He continued to
                        spread the knowledge of Wagners works, and has sometimes had the help
                        of some of the most celebrated of the Bayreuth artists, among others,
                        that of Mme. Materna and Lilli Lehmann. At the end of the season of 1897
                        Lamoureux wished to disband his orchestra in order to conduct concerts
                        abroad. But the members of the orchestra decided to remain together
                        under the name of the _Association des Concerts-Lamoureux_, with
                        Lamoureuxs son-in-law, M. Camille Chevillard, as conductor. But
                        Lamoureux was not long before he returned to the conductorship of the
                        concerts, which had now returned to the Chateau-dEau theatre; and a few
                        months before his death, in 1899, he conducted the first performance of
                        _Tristan_ at the Nouveau theatre. And so he had the happiness of being
                        present at the complete triumph of the cause for which he had fought so
                        stubbornly for nearly twenty years.[220]
                        Mahler has got some striking effects from this combination of voices and
                        instruments, and he did well to seek inspiration in this direction from
                        Beethoven and Liszt. It is incredible that the nineteenth century should
                        have put this combination to so little use; for I think the gain may be
                        poetical as well as musical.
                        Think of the effect that such works must have produced at that period.
                        Berlioz was the first to be astonished when he heard them for the first
                        time. At the _Ouverture des Francs-Juges_ he wept and tore his hair, and
                        fell sobbing on the kettledrums. At the performance of his _Tuba mirum_,
                        in Berlin, he nearly fainted. The composer who most nearly approached
                        him was Weber, and, as we have already seen, Berlioz only knew him late
                        in life. But how much less rich and complex is Webers music, in spite
                        of its nervous brilliance and dreaming poetry. Above all, Weber is much
                        more mundane and more of a classicist; he lacks Berliozs revolutionary
                        passion and plebeian force; he is less expressive and less grand."

                        invokes it in an incantation full of weird and beautiful vocal music:
                        \x22O sea! Sinister sea with your angry charm, gentle sea with your kiss of
                        death, hear me!\x22 And the sea replies in a song. Voices mingle with the
                        orchestra in a symphony of increasing anger. Vita swears she will give
                        herself to no one but the Stranger. She lifts the emerald above her
                        head, and it shines with a lurid light. \x22Receive, O sea, as a token of
                        my oath, the sacred stone, the holy emerald! Then may its power be no
                        longer invoked, and none may know again its protecting virtue. Jealous
                        sea, take back your own, the last offering of a betrothed! With an
                        impressive gesture she throws the emerald into the waves, and a dark
                        green light suddenly shines out against the black sky. This supernatural
                        light slowly spreads over the water until it reaches the horizon, and
                        the sea begins to roll in great billows.\x22 Then the sea takes up its song
                        in an angrier tone; the orchestra thunders, and the storm bursts."

                        and to remind the French musicians who have been satisfied with their
                        first victory that the future is anything but sure, and that we must
                        never disarm while we have a common enemy before us, an enemy especially

                        It was a sweet and happy meeting of mother and son, after such a
                        long separation. The two soon found a modest apartment in the Rue

                        The first act of _Siegfried_ is one of the most dramatic in the
                        Tetralogy. Nothing satisfied me more completely at Bayreuth, both as
                        regards the actors and the dramatic effects. Fantastic creatures like
                        Alberich and Mimi, who seem to be out of their element in France, are
                        rooted deep down in German imaginations. The Bayreuth actors surpassed
                        themselves in making them startlingly lifelike, with a trembling and
                        grimacing realism. Burgstaller, who was then making his debut in
                        _Siegfried_, acted with an impetuous awkwardness which accorded well
                        with the part. I remember with what zest--which seemed in no way
                        affected--he played the hero smith, labouring like a true workman,
                        blowing the fire and making the blade glow, dipping it in the steaming
                        water, and working it on the anvil; and then, in a burst of Homeric
                        gaiety, singing that fine hymn at the end of the first act, which sounds
                        like an air by Bach or Haendel."

                        Conservatoire, which was an honor he appreciated.
                        Everything connected with the theater was of absorbing interest to
                        this precocious child. Weber, who lived in Dresden, often passed their
                        house and was observed with almost religious awe by little Richard.
                        Sometimes the great composer dropped in to have a chat with the
                        mother, who was well liked among musicians and artists. Thus Weber
                        became the idol of the lads boyhood, and he knew \x22Der Freischetz\x22
                        almost by heart. If he was not allowed to go to the theater to
                        listen to his favorite opera, there would be scenes of weeping and
                        beseeching, until permission was granted for him to run off to the

                        Only the barest facts of his early life can be told. We know that he
                        was born at Saint Germain-en-Laye, France, August 22, 1862. From the
                        very beginning he seemed precociously gifted in music, and began at a
                        very early age to study the piano. His first lessons on the instrument
                        were received from Mme. de Sivry, a former pupil of Chopin. At ten he
                        entered the Paris Conservatoire, obtaining his Solfege medals in 1874,
                        75, and 76, under Lavignac; a second prize for piano playing
                        from Marmontel in 1877, a first prize for accompanying in 1880; an
                        accessory prize for counterpoint and fugue in 1882, and finally the
                        Grande Prix de Rome, with his cantata, \x22LEnfant Prodigue,\x22 in 1884,
                        as a pupil of Guirand.
                        But while admitting that _Tristan_ is a symphony that is not suitable
                        for representation, one also recognises its blemishes and, above all,
                        its unevenness. The orchestration in the first act is often rather thin,
                        and the plot lacks solidity. There are gaps and unaccountable holes, and
                        melodious lines left suspended in space. From beginning to end, lyrical
                        bursts of melody are broken by declamations, or, what is worse, by
                        dissertations. Frenzied whirlwinds of passion stop suddenly to give
                        place to recitatives of explanation or argument. And although these
                        recitatives are nearly always a great relief, although these
                        metaphysical reveries have a character of barbarous cunning that one
                        relishes, yet the superior beauty of the movements of pure poetry,
                        emotion, and music is so evident, that this musical and philosophical
                        drama serves to give one a distaste for philosophy and drama and
                        everything else that cramps and confines music.
                        For the young genius, Mannheim possessed a special attraction of which
                        the father knew nothing. Shortly after their arrival in the city,
                        Wolfgang became acquainted with the Weber family. The two oldest
                        daughters, Aloysia, fifteen, and Constanza, fourteen, were charming
                        girls just budding into womanhood. Aloysia had a sweet, pure voice,
                        and was studying for the stage; indeed she had already made her debut
                        in opera. It was not at all strange that young Mozart, who often
                        joined the family circle, should fall in love with the girls fair
                        beauty and fresh voice, should write songs for her and teach her
                        to sing them as he wished. They were much together and their early
                        attraction fast ripened into love. Wolfgang formed a project for
                        helping the Webers, who were in rather straitened circumstances, by
                        undertaking a journey to Italy in company with Aloysia and her father;
                        he would write an opera in which Aloysia should appear as prima donna.
                        Of this brilliant plan he wrote his father, saying they could stop in
                        Salzburg on the way, when the father and Nannerl could meet the fair
                        young singer, whom they would be sure to love."

                        languages, even music. Hector was a most romantic, impressionable
                        child, who peopled nature with fairies and elves, as he lay under
                        great trees and dreamed fantastic day dreams. Poetry and romantic

                        the subject is far removed from passion, and yet also express sweet and
                        tender sentiments and the deepest calm.\x22[72]"

  communication_note: "After a summer spent quietly with his parents at Landaas, he began
                        to prepare for coming musical activities. The next season he gave
                        his first concert in Bergen, at which the piano pieces of Op. 1, Four
                        Songs for Alto, and a String Quartet were played. With the proceeds
                        of this concert he bought orchestral and chamber music, and began to
                        study score, which he had not previously learned to do. In the spring
                        of 1863--he was hardly twenty then--he left home and took up his
                        residence in Copenhagen, a much larger city, offering greater
                        opportunities for an ambitious young musician. It was also the home of
                        Niels W. Gade, the foremost Scandinavian composer.
                        He was given a magnificent funeral, which was attended by all the people
                        who had done nothing for him while he was alive. The Austrian State, the
                        town of Vienna, his native town Windischgratz, the Conservatoire that
                        had expelled him, the _Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde_ who had been so
                        long unfriendly to his works, the Opera that had been closed to him, the
                        singers that had scorned him, the critics that had scoffed at him--they
                        were all there. They sang one of his saddest melodies, _Resignation_, a
                        setting of a poem of Eichendorffs, and a chorale by his old friend
                        Bruckner, who had died several years before him. His faithful friends,
                        Faisst at the head of them, took care to have a monument erected to his
                        memory near those of Beethoven and Schubert.
                        The Mendelssohn family originally lived in Hamburg. Their house faced
                        one of the fine squares of the city, with a handsome church on
                        the opposite side. The building is still there and well preserved,
                        although the principal story is used as public dining rooms. A large
                        tablet has been placed above the doorway, with a likeness of the
                        composer encircled by a wreath of laurel. Here little Felix was born,
                        February 3, 1809. There were other children, Fanny a year or two
                        older, then after Felix came Rebekka and little Paul. When French
                        soldiers occupied the town in 1811, life became very unpleasant for
                        the German residents, and whoever could, sought refuge in other cities
                        and towns. Among those who successfully made their escape was the
                        Mendelssohn-Bartholdy family, the second name belonged to the family
                        and was used to distinguish their own from other branches of the
                        Mendelssohn family. With his wife and children, Abraham Mendelssohn
                        fled to Berlin, and made his home for some years with the grandmother,
                        who had a house on the Neue Promenade, a fine broad street, with
                        houses only on one side, the opposite side descended in a grassy slope
                        to the canal, which flowed lazily by.

  communication_note: "It may be thought that one so reticent and retiring, of such hasty
                        temper and brusque manners, would scarcely be attracted to women.
                        But Beethoven, it is said, was very susceptible to the charm of the
                        opposite sex. He was however, most careful and high-souled in all his
                        relations with women. He was frequently in love, but it was usually a
                        Platonic affection. For the Countess Julie Guicciardi he protested
                        the most passionate love, which was in a measure returned. She was
                        doubtless his \x22immortal beloved,\x22 whose name vibrates through the
                        Adagio of the \x22Moonlight Sonata,\x22 which is dedicated to her. He wrote
                        her the most adoring letters; but the union, which he seemed to desire
                        so intensely, was never brought about, though the reason is not known.
                        For Bettina von Arnim, Goethes little friend, he conceived a tender
                        affection. Another love of his was for the Countess Marie Erdedy,
                        to whom he dedicated the two fine Trios, Op. 70, but this was also
                        a purely Platonic affection. The composer was unfortunate in his
                        attachments, for the objects were always of a much higher social
                        standing than himself. As he constantly associated with people of rank
                        and culture, it was natural that the young girl nobly born, with all
                        the fascinations of the high bred aristocrat, should attract him far
                        more than the ordinary woman of his own class. And thus it happened
                        that several times he staked his chances of happiness on a love he
                        knew could never be consummated. Yet no one needed a kind, helpful,
                        sympathetic wife more than did our poet-musician. She would have
                        soothed his sensitive soul when he suffered from fancied wrongs,
                        shielded him from intrusion, shared his sorrows and triumphs, and
                        attended to his house-keeping arrangements, which were always in a sad
                        state of confusion. This blissful state was seemingly not for him. It
                        was best for the great genius to devote himself wholly to his divine
                        art, and to create those masterpieces which will always endure.
                        It proved an epoch-making occasion. For this first success as
                        conductor led him to undertake a three months tour through western
                        Europe in 1888. On his return to St. Petersburg he conducted a program
                        of his own compositions for the Philharmonic Society, which was
                        also successful, in spite of the intense nervousness which he always
                        suffered. As a result of his concert he received offers to conduct
                        concerts in Hamburg, Dresden, Leipsic, Vienna, Copenhagen and London,
                        many of which he accepted.
                        Schumann took up arms in favor of the younger generation of musicians
                        and helped make the fame of many now held in the worlds highest
                        esteem. Sometimes, he admits, his ardor carried him too far in
                        recognition of youthful talent, but in the main he was very just
                        in his estimates. We do not forget how his quick commendation aided
                        Brahms.
                        \x22But I am unhappy in not being able to apply myself to anything but
                        music. I know I am feeding on an illusion, and that reality is the
                        only thing worth having. My health is not good, and my nerves are
                        in a state of increasing weakness. My life, lived entirely in the
                        imagination and without sufficient action, tires me so, that I can
                        only work with frequent breaks and long intervals of rest;
                        otherwise I pay the penalty with long and painful suffering.... I
                        am very lonely. I often wish for death."

  communication_note: "\x22I lingered late one autumn evening in the country, irresistibly
                        fascinated by the magic of old world forests. From yellowing leaves,
                        fluttering earthward, celebrating the glorious agony of the trees,
                        from the clangorous angelus bidding the fields to slumber, rose a
                        sweet persuasive voice, counseling perfect oblivion. The sun was
                        setting solitary. Beasts and men turned peacefully homeward, having
                        accomplished their impersonal tasks.\x22
                        What strikes one also in the _Lieder_ is the importance of the
                        pianoforte accompaniment and its independence of the voice. Sometimes
                        the voice and the pianoforte express the contrast that so often exists
                        between the words and the thought of the poem; at other times they
                        express two personalities, as in his setting of Goethes _Prometheus_,
                        where the accompaniment represents Zeus sending out his thunderbolts,
                        and the voice interprets Titan; or again, he may depict, as in the
                        setting of Eichendorffs _Serenade_, a student in love in the
                        accompaniment, while the song is the voice of an old man who is
                        listening to it and thinking of his youth. But in whatever he is
                        describing, the pianoforte and the voice have always their own
                        individuality. You cannot take anything away from his _Lieder_ without
                        spoiling the whole; and it is especially so with his instrumental
                        passages, which give us the beginning and end of his emotion, and which
                        circle round it and sum it up. The musical form, following closely the
                        poetic form, is extremely varied. It may sometimes express a fugitive
                        thought, a brief record of a poetic impression or some little action, or
                        it may be a great epic or dramatic picture. Mueller remarks that Wolf put
                        more into a poem than the poet himself--as in the
                        _Italienisches-Liederbuch_. It is the worst reproach they can make about
                        him, and it is not an ordinary one. Wolf excelled especially in setting
                        poems which accorded with his own tragic fate, as if he had some
                        presentiment of it. No one has better expressed the anguish of a
                        troubled and despairing soul, such as we find in the old harp-player in
                        _Wilhelm Meister_, or the splendid nihility of certain poems of
                        Michelangelo."

  communication_note: "Strauss has directed Wagners dramas at Weimar since 1889. While
                        breathing their atmosphere he turned his attention to the theatre, and
                        wrote the libretto of his opera _Guntram_. Illness interrupted his work,
                        and he was in Egypt when he took it up again. The music of the first act
                        was written between December, 1892, and February, 1893, while travelling
                        between Cairo and Luxor; the second act was finished in June, 1893, in
                        Sicily; and the third act early in September, 1893, in Bavaria. There
                        is, however, no trace of an oriental atmosphere in this music. We find
                        rather the melodies of Italy, the reflection of a mellow light, and a
                        resigned calm. I feel in it the languid mind of the convalescent, almost
                        the heart of a young girl whose tears are ready to flow, though she is
                        smiling a little at her own sad dreams. It seems to me that Strauss must
                        have a secret affection for this work, which owes its inspiration to
                        the undefinable impressions of convalescence. His fever fell asleep in
                        it, and certain passages are full of the caressing touch of nature, and
                        recall Berliozs _Les Troyens_. But too often the music is superficial
                        and conventional, and the tyranny of Wagner makes itself felt--a rare
                        enough occurrence in Strausss other works. The poem is interesting;
                        Strauss has put much of himself into it, and one is conscious of the
                        crisis that unsettled his broad-minded but often self-satisfied and
                        inconsistent ideas.
                        I have said that I attribute this fact to the detestable influence of
                        the theatre, to which nearly all these artists are attached as
                        _Kapellmeister_, or directors of opera. To this they owe the
                        melodramatic character of their music, even though it is on the surface
                        only--music written for show, and aiming chiefly at effect."

                        nearly the whole musical generation of Paris of that time took its
                        inspiration from Cesar Franck. And it was largely with the intention of
                        perpetuating his teaching that his pupils, Charles Bordes and Vincent
                        dIndy, and his friend, Alexandre Guilmant, founded in 1894, four years
                        after his death, the _Schola Cantorum_, which has kept his memory alive
                        ever since.

                        while his heart was set on music. Yielding to her wishes for a time he
                        went to Leipsic in March 1828 to prepare to enter the University as
                        a student of law. He also gained consent to study piano at the same
                        time, and began lessons with Frederick Wieck. The desire to study with
                        Wieck was inspired by the piano playing of his little daughter, Clara,
                        then nine years old, who had already gained a considerable degree of
                        musical culture and promised to make her mark as a pianist."

                        The scene of _LEtranger_ is laid in France, by the sea, whose murmuring
                        calm we hear in a symphonic introduction. The fishermen are coming back
                        to port; the fishing has been bad. But one among them, \x22a man about
                        forty years old, with a sad and dignified air,\x22 has been more fortunate
                        than the others. The fishermen envy him, and vaguely suspect him of
                        sorcery. He tries to enter into friendly conversation with them, and
                        offers his catch to a poor family. But in vain; his advances are
                        repulsed and his generosity is eyed with suspicion. He is a

                        work-girls come trooping out of their workshop, singing a merry
                        folk-song.[162] One of the young girls, Vita, goes up to the Stranger
                        and speaks to him, for she alone, of all the village, is his friend. The
                        two feel themselves drawn together by a secret sympathy. Vita confides
                        artlessly in the unknown man; they love each other though they do not
                        admit it. The Stranger tries to repress his feelings; for Vita is young

                        But Vita, offended by his coldness, seeks to wound him, and succeeds.
                        In the end he betrays himself. \x22Yes, he loves her, and she knew it well.
                        But now that he has told her so, he will never see her again; and he
                        bids her good-bye.\x22
                        This movement with regard to musical study grew rapidly; and the first
                        International Congress of Music, held in Paris at the time of the
                        Universal Exhibition of 1900, gave historians of music an opportunity of
                        realising their influence. In a few years, teaching about music was to
                        be had everywhere. At first there were the free lectures of M. Lionel
                        Dauriac and M. Georges Houdard at the Sorbonne, those of MM. Aubry,
                        Gastoue, Pirro, and Vincent dIndy at the _Schola_ and the _Institut
                        Catholique_; and then, at the beginning of 1902, there was the little
                        Faculty of Music of the _Ecole des Hautes Etudes sociales_, making a
                        centre for the efforts of French scholars of music; and, in 1900, two
                        official courses of lectures on Musical History and Aesthetics were
                        given at the College de France and the Sorbonne."

  communication_note: "And so it was settled that George Frederick should devote himself to
                        music. Frederick Zachau, organist of the cathedral at Halle, was
                        the teacher chosen to instruct the boy on the organ, harpsichord and
                        violin. He also taught him composition, and showed him how different
                        countries and composers differed in their ideas of musical style. Very
                        soon the boy was composing the regular weekly service for the church,
                        besides playing the organ whenever Zachau happened to be absent. At
                        that time the boy could not have been more than eight years old.
                        Not long after this Handel was appointed Chapel master to the Duke
                        of Chandos, and was expected to live at the princely mansion he
                        inhabited. The size and magnificence of The Cannons was the talk of
                        the country for miles around. Here the composer lived and worked,
                        played the organ in the chapel, composed church music for the service
                        and wrote his first English oratorio, \x22Esther.\x22 This was performed in
                        the Dukes chapel, and the Duke on this occasion handed the composer
                        five thousand dollars. Numerous compositions for the harpsichord
                        belong to this period, among them the air and variations known as
                        \x22The Harmonious Blacksmith.\x22 The story goes that Handel was walking
                        to Cannons through the village of Edgeware, and being overtaken by a
                        heavy shower, sought shelter in the smithy. The blacksmith was singing
                        at his work and his hammer kept time with his song. The composer was
                        struck with the air and its accompaniment, and as soon as he reached
                        home, wrote out the tune with the variations. This story has been
                        disputed, and it is not known whether it is true or not."

  communication_note: "Prince Paul Anton passed away after a year and his brother Nikolaus
                        succeeded him. He advanced Haydn still further, and increased his
                        salary. Werner, the old Capellmeister, died in 1766, and Haydn
                        succeeded to the full title. This was the fathers dream for his boy
                        Josef, and it had been abundantly realized. His mother had passed
                        away, but his father was living, and had come, on one occasion,
                        to Eisenstadt to see him. His brother Michael who had now become
                        Concertmeister in Salzburg, spent several happy days with him also.
                        Already, as a young man, symptoms of deafness began to appear, and
                        the fear of becoming a victim of this malady made the composer more
                        sensitive than ever. He was not yet thirty when this happened, and
                        believing his life work at an end, he became deeply depressed. Various
                        treatments were tried for increasing deafness; at one time it seemed
                        to be cured by the skill of Dr. Schmidt, to whom out of gratitude he
                        dedicated his Septet, arranged as a Trio. By his advice the composer
                        went for the summer of 1820 to the little village of Heiligenstadt
                        (which means Holy City) in the hope that the calm, sweet environment
                        would act as a balm to his troubled mind. During this period of rest
                        and quiet his health improved somewhat, but from now on he had to give
                        up conducting his works, on account of his deafness.

  communication_note: "The first performance of _Pelleas et Melisande_ in Paris, on April 30th,
                        1902, was a very notable event in the history of French music; its
                        importance can only be compared with that of the first performance of
                        Lullys _Cadmus et Hermione_, Rameaus _Hippolyte et Aricie_, and
                        Quicks _Iphigenie en Aulide_; and it may be looked upon as one of the
                        three or four red-letter days in the calendar of our lyric stage.[199]
                        The lessons with Mr. Buitrago continued for several years, and then he
                        was taken to a professional piano teacher, Paul Desvernine, with
                        whom he remained till he was fifteen. During this time he received
                        occasional lessons from the brilliant Venezuelan pianist, Teresa
                        Carreeo, who admired his gifts and later played his piano concertos.
                        In the _Second Symphony in C minor_, the first three parts are purely
                        instrumental; but in the fourth part the voice of a contralto is heard
                        singing these sad and simple words:
                        About the same time he invented a new way of rehearsing the
                        orchestra--the remote-control method. An assistant conductor wielded
                        the stick while Stoky sat in the rear of the dark hall manipulating an
                        intricate system of colored lights that made known his wishes to his
                        understudy on the platform."

                        And now Verdi fell in love with the beautiful Margherita, the oldest
                        daughter of Barezzi, who did not mind giving his daughter to a poor
                        young man, for Verdi possessed something worth far more than money,
                        and that was great musical talent. The young people were married in
                        1836, and the whole Philharmonic Society attended.

  communication_note: "In considering Strausss music as a whole, one is at first struck by the
                        diversity of his style. The North and the South mingle; and in his
                        melodies one feels the attraction of the sun. Something Italian had
                        crept into _Tristan_; but how much more of Italy there is in the work of
                        this disciple of Nietzsche. The phrases are often Italian and their
                        harmonies ultra-Germanic. Perhaps one of the greatest charms of
                        Strausss art is that we are able to watch the rent in the dark clouds
                        of German polyphony, and see shining through it the smiling line of an
                        Italian coast and the gay dancers on its shore. This is not merely a
                        vague analogy. It would be easy, if idle, to notice unmistakable
                        reminiscences of France and Italy even in Strausss most advanced works,
                        such as _Zarathustra_ and _Heldenleben_. Mendelssohn, Gounod, Wagner,
                        Rossini, and Mascagni elbow one another strangely. But these disparate
                        elements have a softer outline when the work is taken as a whole, for
                        they have been absorbed and controlled by the composers imagination.
                        [Footnote 183: A large number of works on Hugo Wolf have been published
                        in Germany since his death. The chief is the great biography of Herr

                        It may seem a paradox to say that no musician is so little known as
                        Berlioz. The world thinks it knows him. A noisy fame surrounds his
                        person and his work. Musical Europe has celebrated his centenary.
                        Germany disputes with France the glory of having nurtured and shaped his
                        genius. Russia, whose triumphal reception consoled him for the
                        indifference and enmity of Paris,[1] has said, through the voice of
                        Balakirew, that he was \x22the only musician France possessed.\x22 His chief
                        compositions are often played at concerts; and some of them have the
                        rare quality of appealing both to the cultured and the crowd; a few have
                        even reached great popularity. Works have been dedicated to him, and he
                        himself has been described and criticised by many writers. He is popular
                        even to his face; for his face, like his music, was so striking and
                        singular that it seemed to show you his character at a glance. No clouds
                        hide his mind and its creations, which, unlike Wagners, need no
                        initiation to be understood; they seem to have no hidden meaning, no
                        subtle mystery; one is instantly their friend or their enemy, for the
                        first impression is a lasting one.

                        We find Robert Schumann at nineteen domiciled in the beautiful city of
                        Heidelberg, and surrounded by a few musical friends, who were kindred
                        spirits. With a good piano in his room, the \x22life of flowers,\x22 as
                        he called it, began. Almost daily they made delightful trips in a
                        one-horse carriage into the suburbs. For longer trips they went to
                        Baden-Baden, Wurms, Spires and Mannheim. Whenever Robert went with
                        his friends he always carried a small \x22dumb piano\x22 on which he
                        industriously practised finger exercises, meanwhile joining in the
                        conversation. During the following August and September, Robert and
                        two or three chosen companions made a delightful journey through
                        Italy, the young man preparing himself by studying Latin, in which he
                        became so fluent that he could translate poems from one language to
                        the other."

                        his friend might set to music. The following year, 1815, he wrote a
                        hundred and thirty-seven songs, to say nothing of six operas, and much
                        music for church and piano. Twenty-nine of these songs were written
                        in the month of August. One day in August eight songs were created; on
                        another day seven. Some of the songs were quite long, making between
                        twenty and thirty pages when printed.
                        \x22The next scene represented a forest. Wotan was waking up the
                        dragon. At first the dragon said, I want to go to sleep; but
                        eventually he came out of his grotto. The dragon was represented by
                        two men clothed in a green skin with some scales stuck about it. At
                        one end of the skin they wagged a tail, and at the other end they
                        opened a crocodiles mouth, out of which came fire. The dragon,
                        which ought to have been a frightful beast--and perhaps he would
                        have frightened children about five years old--said a few words in
                        a bass voice. It was so childish and feeble that one was astonished
                        to see grown-up people present; even thousands of so-called
                        cultured people looked on and listened attentively, and went into
                        raptures. Then Siegfried arrived with his horn. He lay down during
                        a pause, which is reputed to be very beautiful; and sometimes he
                        talked to himself, and sometimes he was quite silent. He wanted to
                        imitate the song of the birds, and cut a rush with his horn, and
                        made a flute out of it. But he played the flute badly, and so he
                        began to blow his horn. The scene is intolerable, and there is not
                        the least trace of music in it. I was annoyed to see three thousand
                        people round about me, listening submissively to this absurdity
                        and dutifully admiring it."

  communication_note: "The influence of Franck was twofold: it was artistic and moral. On the
                        one hand he was, if I may so put it, an admirable professor of musical
                        architecture; he founded a school of symphony and chamber-music such as
                        France had never had before, which in certain directions was newer and
                        more daring than that of the German symphony writers. And, on the other
                        hand, he exercised by his own character a memorable influence over all
                        those who came into contact with him. His profound faith, that fine,
                        indulgent, and calm faith, shone round him like a glory. The Catholic
                        party, who were awakening to new life in France just then, tried, after
                        his death, to identify his ideals with their own. But this was, as we
                        have said elsewhere,[225] to narrow Francks mind; for its great charm
                        lay in its harmonious union of religion and liberty, which never limited
                        its artistic sympathies to an exclusive ideal. The composers son, M.
                        Georges Cesar-Franck, has in vain protested against this monopoly of his
                        father, and says:
                        Beethoven as a teacher, showed none of the impatience and carelessness
                        that were seen in his personal habits. He insisted on a pupil
                        repeating the passage carefully a number of times, until it could be
                        played to his satisfaction. He did not seem to mind a few wrong notes,
                        but the pupil must not fail to grasp the meaning or put in the right
                        expression, or his anger would be aroused. The first was an accident,
                        the other would be a lack of knowledge of feeling.
                        [Footnote 199: May I be allowed to say that I am trying to write this
                        study from a purely historical point of view, by eliminating all
                        personal feeling--which would be of no value here. As a matter of fact,
                        I am not a Debussyite; my sympathies are with quite another kind of art.
                        But I feel impelled to give homage to a great artist, whose work I am
                        able to judge with some impartiality.]
                        All the rest of the journey to Vienna, Wolfgang was the life of the
                        party, eager to know the name and history of everything they met. At
                        the custom-house on the frontier, he made friends with the officials
                        by playing for them on his violin, and thus secured an easy pass for
                        the party."

  communication_note: "I have quoted this rather long passage to show how the impression made
                        by one of Rameaus operas on his contemporaries resembled that made by
                        Wagner on his enemies. It was not without reason that Rameau was said to
                        be Wagners forerunner, as Rousseau was Tolstoys forerunner.
                        [Footnote 156: I speak of the passages where he expresses himself
                        freely, and is not interpreting a dramatic situation necessary to his
                        subject, as in that fine symphonic part of the _Redemption_, where he
                        describes the triumph of Christ. But even there we find traces of
                        sadness and suffering.]
                        All this is not much, and we are yet terribly behindhand, especially as
                        regards secondary teaching, which is considered less important than
                        primary teaching.[255] But we are scrambling out of an abyss of
                        ignorance, and it is something to have the desire to get out of it. We
                        must remember that Germany has not always been in its present plethoric
                        state of musical prosperity. The great choral societies only date from
                        the end of the eighteenth century. Germany in the time of Bach was
                        poor--if not poorer--in means for performing choral works than France
                        to-day. Bachs only executants were his pupils at the Thomasschule at
                        Leipzig, of which barely a score knew how to sing.[256] And now these
                        people gather together for the great _Maennergesangsfeste_ (choral
                        festivals) and the _Musikfeste_ (music festivals) of Imperial Germany.
                        Just after completing his great work, The Art of Fugue, Bach became
                        totally blind, due no doubt, to the great strain he had always put
                        upon his eyes, in not only writing his own music, but in copying out
                        large works of the older masters. Notwithstanding this handicap he
                        continued at work up to the very last. On the morning of the day on
                        which he passed away, July 28, 1750, he suddenly regained his sight. A
                        few hours later he became unconscious and passed in sleep."

                        naturally. The independence of his thinking is unmistakable, but it
                        does not run into wilfulness. There is no violent break with the past,
                        but simply the quickening of certain French qualities by the infusion
                        of a new personality. It seemed as if a new and charming miniaturist
                        had appeared, who was doing both for piano and song what had never
                        been done before. The style of the two Arabesques and the more
                        successful of the Ariettes oubliees is perfect. A liberator seemed to
                        have come into music, to take up, half a century later, the work of
                        Chopin--the work of redeeming the art from the excessive objectivity
                        of German thought, of giving it not only a new soul but a new body,
                        swift, lithe and graceful. And that this exquisitely clear, pellucid
                        style could be made to carry out not only gaiety and whimsicality but
                        emotion of a deeper sort, is proved by the lovely \x22Clair de Lune.\x22
                        Returning to Paris, Franz devoted much of his time to ardent study of
                        counterpoint, under Anton Reicha. In six months study he had mastered
                        the difficulties of this intricate art.
                        Bachs prospects were now so much improved that he thought he might
                        make a home for himself. He had fallen in love with a cousin, Maria
                        Bach, and they were married October 17, 1707."

                        pedantic; they certainly were far from comprehending the romantic
                        trend of the impressionable new pupil, for they tried to curb his
                        originality and square it with rules and customs. This process was
                        very irksome, for the boy wanted to go his own gait.
                        It was after this second concert that Franzs reputation reached the
                        ears of Beethoven, always the object of the boys warmest admiration.
                        Several times Franz and his father had tried to see the great master,
                        but without success. Schindler was appealed to and promised to do his
                        best. He wrote in Beethovens diary, as the master was quite deaf:
                        Do you remember Goethes ballad of _Der Zauberlehrling_ (_LApprenti
                        Sorcier_) which Dukas so cleverly made into music? There, in the absence
                        of his master, an apprentice set working some magic spells, and so
                        opened sluice-gates that no one could shut; and the house was flooded.
                        And now, when he was in dire need, and suffering, a marvelous boon was
                        coming to him, as wonderful as any to be found in fairy tale. A fairy
                        Prince was coming to the rescue of this struggling genius. This Prince
                        was the young monarch of Bavaria, who had just succeeded to the throne
                        left by the passing of his father. The youthful Prince, ardent and
                        generous, had long worshiped in secret the master and his music.
                        One of his first acts on becoming Ludwig of Bavaria, was to send for
                        Wagner to come to his capital at once and finish his life work in
                        peace. \x22He wants me to be with him always, to work, to rest, to
                        produce my works,\x22 wrote Wagner to a friend in Zurich, where he had
                        been staying. \x22He will give me everything I need; I am to finish my
                        Nibelungen and he will have them performed as I wish. All troubles
                        are to be taken from me; I shall have what I need, if I only stay with
                        him.\x22"

                        I should like to try to sketch here the strange and arresting
                        personality of the man who in Germany is considered the inheritor of
                        Wagners genius--the man who has had the audacity to write, after
                        Beethoven, an Heroic Symphony, and to imagine himself the hero."

  communication_note: "By July 1832, Berlioz had returned to La Cete Saint Andre for a home
                        visit. He had spent a year in Italy, had seen much, composed a number
                        of important things, but left Rome without regrets, and found the
                        familiar landscape near his home more fascinating than anything Italy
                        could show.
                        [Footnote 83: This revolutionary theory was already Mozarts: \x22Music
                        should reign supreme and make one forget everything else.... In an opera
                        it is absolutely necessary that Poetry should be Musics obedient
                        daughter\x22 (Letter to his father, 13 October, 1781). Despairing probably
                        at being unable to obtain this obedience, Mozart thought seriously of
                        breaking up the form of opera, and of putting in its place, in 1778, a
                        sort of melodrama (of which Rousseau had given an example in 1773),
                        which he called \x22duodrama,\x22 where music and poetry were loosely
                        associated, yet not dependent on each other, but went side by side on
                        two parallel roads (Letter of 12 November, 1778).]

                        The master felt this loss keenly. He spent the summer in Ischl as
                        usual, composing, among other things, the Eleven Choral Preludes. Most
                        of these have death for their subject, showing that his mind was taken
                        up with the idea. His friends noticed he had lost his ruddy color and
                        that his complexion was pale. In the autumn he went to Carlsbad for
                        the cure."

  communication_note: "M. Buchors endeavours have been the most extensive and the most
                        fruitful, but he is not alone in individual effort. There was, twenty
                        years ago, in the suburbs of Paris and in the provinces, a large number
                        of well-meaning people who devoted themselves to the work of musical
                        education with sincerity and splendid enthusiasm. But their good works
                        were too isolated, and were swamped by the apathy of the people about
                        them; though sometimes they kindled little fires of love and
                        understanding in art, which only needed coaxing in order to burn
                        brightly; and even their less happy efforts generally succeeded in
                        lighting a few sparks, which were left smouldering in peoples
                        hearts.[250]
                        Under the sway of such opinions he began to sketch the plot of
                        his next opera, \x22Prohibition of Love\x22 (Liebesverbot), founded on
                        Shakespeares \x22Measure for Measure.\x22 This was while he was in Teplitz
                        on a summer holiday. In the autumn he took a position as conductor
                        in a small operatic theater in Magdeburg. Here he worked at his new
                        opera, hoping he could induce the admired Schroeder-Devrient to be his
                        heroine."

                        Chopin. The first awakening of this feeling came from his admiration
                        of Constantia Gladowska, a beautiful girl and vocal pupil at the
                        Conservatory at Warsaw. Strangely enough he admired the young lady for

                        himself to her. But she filled his thoughts by day, and he confessed
                        to dreaming of her each night. When she made her debut in opera, he
                        hung on every note she sang and rejoiced in her success but did not
                        make his feelings known to her. All this pent-up emotion was confined
                        to his piano, in impassioned improvisations."

                        to Hamburg, to his composing and teaching. He, however, played the
                        Concerto in his native city on a distinguished occasion, when Joachim
                        was a soloist in Spohrs Gesang-Scene, Stockhausen in a magnificent
                        Aria, and then Johann, pale, blond, slight, but calm and self
                        controlled. The Concerto scored a considerable success at last, and
                        the young composer was content.
                        The first part shows you three people: a man, a woman, and a child. The
                        man is represented by three themes: a _motif_ full of spirit and humour,
                        a thoughtful _motif_, and a _motif_ expressing eager and enthusiastic
                        action. The woman has only two themes: one expressing caprice, and the
                        other love and tenderness. The child has a single _motif_, which is
                        quiet, innocent, and not very defined in character; its real value is
                        not shown until it is developed.... Which of the two parents is he like?
                        The family sit round him and discuss him. \x22He is just like his father\x22
                        (_Ganz der Papa_), say the aunts. \x22He is the image of his mother\x22 (_Ganz
                        die Mama_), say the uncles.
                        In 1896 he bought some property near Peterboro, New Hampshire--fifteen
                        acres with a small farmhouse and other buildings, and fifty acres of
                        forest. The buildings were remodeled into a rambling but comfortable
                        dwelling, and here, amid woods and hills he loved, he spent the summer
                        of each year. He built a little log cabin in the woods near by, and
                        here he wrote some of his best music.
                        Pasdeloup took up the work. After having been conductor for the _Societe
                        des jeunes artistes du Conservatoire_ since 1851, in the Salle Herz, he
                        founded, in 1861, at the Cirque dHiver, with the financial support of a
                        rich moneylender, the first _Concerts populaires de musique classique_.
                        Unhappily, says M. Saint-Saens, Pasdeloup, even up to 1870, made an
                        almost exclusive selection of German classical works. He raised an
                        impenetrable barrier before the young French school, and the only French
                        works he played were symphonies by Gounod and Gouvy, and the overtures
                        of _Les Francs-Juges_ and _La Muette_. It was impossible to set up a
                        rival society against him; and an exclusive monopoly in music was,
                        therefore, held by him. According to M. Saint-Saens he was a mediocre
                        musician, and had, in spite of his passion for music, \x22immense
                        incapacity.\x22 In _Harmonie et Melodie_ M. Saint-Saens says: \x22The few
                        chamber-music societies that existed were also closed to all new-comers;
                        their programmes only contained the names of undisputed celebrities, the
                        writers of classic symphonies. In those times one had really to be
                        devoid of all common sense to write music.\x22"

                        Father Mozart was alarmed when he heard the news of the break, and
                        endeavored to induce Wolfgang to reconsider his decision and return to
                        Salzburg. But the son took a firm stand for his independence. \x22Do not

  communication_note: "Soon after the wedding, Franck, having now lost his pupils--or most
                        of them--and being continually blamed by his father, whom he could no
                        longer supply with funds, decided to leave the parental roof and set
                        up for himself in a home of his own. Of course he had now to work
                        twice as hard, get new pupils and give many more lessons. But with all
                        this extra labor, he made a resolve, which he always kept sacredly,
                        which was to reserve an hour or two each day for composition, or for
                        the study of such musical and literary works as would improve and
                        elevate his mind. Nothing was ever allowed to interfere with this
                        resolution, and to it we owe all his great works.
                        As soon as the father and his boy arrived in Vienna, the best teachers
                        were secured for Franz. Carl Czerny was considered head of the piano
                        profession. Czerny had been a pupil of Beethoven, and was so overrun
                        with pupils himself, that he at first declined to accept another. But
                        when he heard Franz play, he was so impressed that he at once promised
                        to teach him. His nature was the opposite of Hummels, for he was most
                        generous to struggling talent. At the end of twelve lessons, when Adam
                        Liszt wished to pay the debt, Czerny would accept nothing, and for the
                        whole period of instruction--a year and a half--he continued to teach
                        Franz gratuitously."

  communication_note: "But what seemed inconceivable, and what justly annoyed M. Chevillard,
                        was that the whole of _Les Beatitudes_ was not given, but only a section
                        of them. And on this subject I shall take the liberty of recommending
                        that French artists who are guests at similar festivals should not in
                        future agree to a programme with their eyes shut, but have their own
                        wishes considered, or refuse their help. If French musicians are to be
                        given a place in German _Musikfeste_, French people must be allowed to
                        choose the works that are to represent them. And, above all, a French
                        conductor must not be brought from Paris, and find on his arrival a
                        mutilated score and an arbitrary choice of a few fragments that are not
                        even whole in themselves. For they played five out of the eight
                        _Beatitudes_, and cuts had been made in the third and eighth
                        _Beatitudes_. That showed a want of respect for art, for works should be
                        given as they are, or not at all."

  communication_note: "It is said that Tomasso Crinello was the boys master; whether this
                        is true or not, he was surely trained in the Netherland manner of
                        composition.
                        I am far from thinking that the symphony is without a fault. The themes
                        are of unequal value: some are quite commonplace; and, in a general way,
                        the working up of the composition is superior to its underlying
                        thought. I shall come back later on to certain faults in Strausss
                        music; here I only want to consider the overflowing life and feverish
                        joy that set these worlds spinning.
                        What a place in my life those Sunday concerts held! All the week I lived
                        for those two hours; and when they were over I thought about them until
                        the following Sunday. The fascination of Wagners music for youth has
                        often troubled people; they think it poisons the thoughts and dulls the
                        activities. But the generation that was then intoxicated by Wagner does
                        not seem to have shown signs of demoralisation since. Why do not people
                        understand that if we had need of that music it was not because it was
                        death to us, but life. Cramped by the artificiality of a town, far from
                        action, or nature, or any strong or real life, we expanded under the
                        influence of this noble music--music which flowed from a heart filled
                        with understanding of the world and the breath of Nature. In _Die
                        Meistersinger_, in _Tristan_, and in _Siegfried_, we went to find the
                        joy, the love, and the vigour that we so lacked.
                        But the slender, once golden-locked, now white-thatched Leopold is
                        and always was a restless fellow, a bundle of nervous energy, an
                        insatiable lover of experiment, innovation and--the limelight."

  communication_note: "After a time Henrietta reappeared. She had now lost her youth and her
                        power; her beauty was waning, and she was in debt. Berliozs passion was
                        at once rekindled. This time Henrietta accepted his advances. He made
                        alterations in his symphony, and offered it to her in homage of his
                        love. He won her, and married her, with fourteen thousand francs debt.
                        He had captured his dream--Juliet! Ophelia! What was she really? A
                        charming Englishwoman, cold, loyal, and sober-minded, who understood
                        nothing of his passion; and who, from the time she became his wife,
                        loved him jealously and sincerely, and thought to confine him within the
                        narrow world of domestic life. But his affections became restive, and he
                        lost his heart to a Spanish actress (it was always an actress, a
                        virtuoso, or a part) and left poor Ophelia, and went off with Marie
                        Recio, the Ines of _Favorite_, the page of _Comte Ory_--a practical,
                        hardheaded woman, an indifferent singer with a mania for singing. The
                        haughty Berlioz was forced to fawn upon the directors of the theatre in
                        order to get her parts, to write flattering notices in praise of her
                        talents, and even to let her make his own melodies discordant at the
                        concerts he arranged.[18] It would all be dreadfully ridiculous if this
                        weakness of character had not brought tragedy in its train.
                        In his death the world of music lost one of the most highly gifted
                        spirits. His life was important and instructive for its moral and
                        intellectual grandeur, its struggles for the noblest, loftiest
                        subjects as well as for its truly great results.

  communication_note: "Saint-Saens was director with Bussine until 1886. But from 1881 the
                        influence of Franck and his disciples became more and more felt; and
                        Saint-Saens began to lose interest in the efforts of the new school. In
                        1886 there was a division of opinion about a proposition of Vincent
                        dIndys to introduce the works of classical masters and foreign
                        composers into the programmes. This proposition was adopted; but
                        Saint-Saens and Bussine sent in their resignations. Franck then became
                        the true president, although he refused the title; and after his death,
                        in 1890, Vincent dIndy took his place. Under these two directors a
                        quite important place was given to old and classical music by composers
                        such as Palestrina, Vittoria, Josquin, Bach, Haendel, Rameau, Gluck,
                        Beethoven, Schumann, Liszt, and Brahms. Foreign contemporary music only
                        occupied a very limited place. Wagners name only appears once, in a
                        transcription of the _Venusberg_ for the pianoforte; and Richard
                        Strausss name figures only against his Quartette. Grieg had his hour of
                        popularity there about 1887, as well as the Russians--Moussorgski,
                        Borodine, Rimsky-Korsakow, Liadow, and Glazounow--whom M. Debussy has
                        perhaps helped to make known to us. At the present moment the Society
                        seems more exclusively French than ever; and the influence of M. Vincent
                        dIndy and the school of Franck is predominant. That is only natural;
                        the _Societe Nationale_ most truly earned its title to glory by
                        discerning Cesar Francks genius; for the Society was a little sanctuary
                        where the great artist was honoured at a time when he was ignored or
                        laughed at by the rest of the world. This character of a sanctuary was
                        kept even after victory. In its general programme of 1903-1904, the
                        Society reminded us with pride that it had remained faithful to the
                        promises made in 1871; and it added that if, in order to permit its
                        members to keep abreast of the general progress of art, it had little by
                        little allowed classical masterpieces and modern foreign works of
                        interest on its programmes, it had, however, always kept its
                        guest-chamber open, and shaped many a future reputation there."

  communication_note: "In Schuberts boyhood, the music of Mozart influenced him most. This
                        is seen in his earlier compositions. Beethoven was a great master
                        to him then, but as time went on the spell of his music always grew
                        stronger. In 1822, he wrote and published a set of variations on a
                        French air, and dedicated them to Beethoven. He greatly desired to
                        present them in person to the master he adored, but was too shy to go
                        alone. Diabelli, the publisher, finally went with him. Beethoven was
                        courteous but formal, pushing paper and pencil toward his guest, as he
                        was totally deaf. Schubert was too shy to write a single word.
                        However he produced his Variations. Beethoven seemed pleased with the
                        dedication, and looked through the music. Soon he found something in
                        it he did not approve of and pointed it out. The young author, losing
                        his presence of mind, fled from the house. But Beethoven really liked
                        the music and often played it to his nephew.
                        As neither the Capellmeister nor any of the teachers offered to
                        show Josef the principles of composition, he was thrown upon his own
                        resources. With much self denial he scraped together enough money to
                        buy two books which he had seen at the second hand booksellers and
                        which he had longed to possess. One was Foxs \x22Gradus ad Parnassum,\x22
                        a treatise on composition and counterpoint; the other Mathesons \x22The
                        Complete Capellmeister.\x22 Happy in the possession of these books, Josef
                        used every moment outside of school and choir practise to study them.
                        He loved fun and games as well as any boy, but music always came
                        first. The desire to perfect himself was so strong that he often added
                        several hours each day to those already required, working sixteen or
                        eighteen hours out of the twenty-four.

                        the talented men of the young school--Franck, Bizet, Saint-Saens,
                        Massenet, Delibes, Lalo, A. de Castillon, Th. Dubois, Guiraud, Godard,
                        Paladilhe, and Joncieres--and undertook to produce their works in
                        public. He rented the Odeon theatre, and got together an orchestra, the
                        conductorship of which he entrusted to M. Edouard Colonne. And on 2
                        March, 1873, the _Concert National_ was inaugurated in a musical
                        matinee, where M. Saint-Saens played his _Concerto in G minor_ and Mme.
                        Viardot sang Schuberts _Roi des Aulnes_. In the first year six ordinary
                        concerts were given, and, besides that, two sacred concerts with choirs,
                        at which Cesar Francks _Redemption_ and Massenets _Marie-Magdeleine_
                        were performed. In 1874 the Odeon was abandoned for the Chatelet. This
                        venture attracted some attention, and the concerts were patronised by
                        the public; but the financial results were not great.[216] Hartmann was
                        discouraged and wished to give the whole thing up. But M. Edouard
                        Colonne conceived the idea of turning his orchestra into a society, and
                        of continuing the work under the name of _Association Artistique_. Among
                        the artist-founders were MM. Bruneau, Benjamin Godard, and Paul
                        Hillemacher. Its early days were full of struggle; but owing to the
                        perseverance of the Association all obstacles were finally overcome. In
                        1903 a festival was held to celebrate its thirtieth anniversary. During
                        these thirty years it had given more than eight hundred concerts, and
                        had performed the works of about three hundred composers, of which half
                        were French. The four composers most frequently heard at the Chatelet
                        were Saint-Saens, Wagner, Beethoven, and Berlioz.[217]

  communication_subject: "But there, in a strange world, his loneliness seemed so frightful that he became very depressed, and made all haste back to Zurich."
  communication_note: "The year 1833, was one of the most remarkable in his life so far.
                        Not the least important event was the establishment of the \x22Neue
                        Zeitschrift fer Musik.\x22 Schumann himself says of this:--
                        The Lamoureux Concerts have not had as stable a dwelling-place as the
                        Chatelet Concerts. They have wandered about Paris from one room to
                        another--from the Cirque dHiver to the Cirque dEte, and from the
                        Chateau-dEau to the Nouveau Theatre. At the present moment they are in
                        the Salle Gaveau, which is much too small for them. In spite of the
                        progress of music and musical taste, Paris has not yet a concert-hall,
                        as the smallest provincial towns in Germany have; and this shameful
                        indifference, unworthy of the artistic renown of Paris, obliges the
                        symphonic societies to take refuge in circuses or theatres, which they
                        share with other kinds of performers, though the acoustics of these
                        places are not intended for concerts. And so it happens that for six
                        years the Chevillard Concerts have been given at the back of a
                        music-hall, which has the same entrance, and which is only separated
                        from the concert-room by a small passage, so that the roaring choruses
                        of a _danse du venire_ may mingle with an adagio of Beethovens or a
                        scene from the Tetralogy. Worse than this, the smallness of the place
                        into which these concerts have been crammed has been a serious obstacle
                        in the way of making them popular. Nevertheless, in the promenade and
                        galleries of the Nouveau Theatre, in later years, arose what may be
                        called a little war over concertos. It was rather a curious episode in
                        the history of the musical taste of Paris, and merits a few words here.
                        In every country, but especially in those countries that are least
                        musical, a virtuoso profits by public favour, often to the detriment of
                        the work he is performing; for what is most liked in music is the
                        musician. The virtuoso--whose importance must not be underrated, and who
                        is worthy of honour when he is a reverential and sympathetic interpreter
                        of genius--has too often taken a lamentable part, especially in Latin
                        countries, in the degrading of musical taste; for empty virtuosity makes
                        a desert of art. The fashion of inept fantasias and acrobatic
                        variations has, it is true, gone by; but of late years virtuosity has
                        returned in an offensive way, and, sheltering itself under the solemn
                        classical name of \x22concertos,\x22 it usurped a place of rather exaggerated
                        importance in symphony concerts, and especially in M. Chevillards
                        concerts--a place which Lamoureux would never have given it. Then the
                        younger and more enthusiastic part of the public began to revolt; and
                        very soon, with perfect impartiality and quite indiscriminately, began
                        to hiss famous and obscure virtuosi alike in their performance of any
                        concerto, whether it was splendid or detestable. Nothing found favour
                        with them--neither the playing of Paderewski, nor the music of
                        Saint-Saens and the great masters. The management of the concerts went
                        its own way and tried in vain to put out the disturbers, and to forbid
                        them entry to the concert-room; and the battle went on for a long time,
                        and critics were drawn into it. But in spite of its ridiculous excesses,
                        and the barbarism of the methods by which the parterre expressed its
                        opinions, that quarrel is not without interest. It proved how a passion
                        and enthusiasm for music had been roused in France; and the passion,
                        though unjust in its expression, was more fruitful and of far greater
                        worth than indifference.
                        Chopin returned to London in November, and left England in January
                        1849. His purse was very low and his lodgings in the Rue Chaillot,
                        Paris, were represented as costing half their value, the balance being
                        paid by a Russian Countess, who was touched by his need. The generous
                        hearted Miss Stirling raised 25,000 francs for the composer, so his
                        last days were cheered by every comfort. He passed away October 17,
                        1849, and every writer agrees it was a serene passing. His face was
                        beautiful and young, in the flower-covered casket, says Liszt,
                        for friends filled his rooms with blossoms. He was buried from
                        the Madeleine, October thirtieth. The B flat minor Funeral March,
                        orchestrated by Reber, was given, and during the service Lefebure
                        Wely played on the organ the E and B minor Preludes. His grave in Pere
                        Lachaise is sought out by many travelers who admire his great art. It
                        is difficult to find the tomb in that crowded White City, but no
                        doubt all music lovers seek to bring away at least a leaf--as did the
                        writer--from the earthly resting place of the most ideal pianist and
                        composer who ever lived.
                        The most remarkable thing of all is that German artists are gradually
                        losing the power of understanding their own splendid classics and, in
                        particular, Beethoven. Strauss, who is very shrewd and knows exactly his
                        own limitations, does not willingly enter Beethovens domain, though he
                        feels his spirit in a much more living way than any of the other German
                        _Kapellmeister_. At the Strasburg festival he contented himself with
                        conducting, besides his own symphony, the _Oberon Overture_ and a Mozart
                        concerto. These performances were interesting; a personality like his
                        is so curious that it is quite amusing to find it coming out in the
                        works he conducts. But how Mozarts features took on an offhand and
                        impatient air; and how the rhythms were accentuated at the expense of
                        the melodic grace. In this case, however, Strauss was dealing with a
                        concerto, where a certain liberty of interpretation is allowed. But
                        Mahler, who was less discreet, ventured upon conducting the whole of the
                        Beethoven concert. And what can be said of that evening? I will not
                        speak of the _Concerto for pianoforte, in G major_, which Busoni played
                        with a brilliant and superficial execution that took away all breadth
                        from the work; it is enough to note that his interpretation was
                        enthusiastically received by the public. German artists were not
                        responsible for that performance; but they were responsible for that
                        fine cycle of _Lieder, An die entfernte Geliebte_, which was bellowed by
                        a Berlin tenor at the top of his voice, and for the _Choral Symphony_,
                        which was, for me, an unspeakable performance. I could never have
                        believed that a German orchestra conducted by the chief _Kapellmeister_
                        of Austria could have committed such misdeeds. The time was incredible:
                        the scherzo had no life in it; the adagio was taken in hot haste without
                        leaving a moment for dreams; and there were pauses in the finale which
                        destroyed the development of the theme and broke the thread of its
                        thought. The different parts of the orchestra fell over one another, and
                        the whole was uncertain and lacking in balance. I once severely
                        criticised the neo-classic stiffness of Weingartner; but I should have
                        appreciated his healthy equilibrium and his effort to be exact after
                        hearing this neurasthenic rendering of Beethoven. No; we can no longer
                        hear Beethoven and Mozart in Germany to-day, we can only hear Mahler and
                        Strauss. Well, let it be so. We will resign ourselves. The past is past.
                        Let us leave Beethoven and Mozart, and speak of Mahler and Strauss."

                        bitter words: \x22I have just seen in a volume of Mendelssohns Letters

                        Mendelssohn also said: \x22They pretend that Berlioz seeks lofty ideals in
                        art. I dont think so at all. What he wants is to get himself married.\x22
                        The injustice of these insulting words will disgust all those who
                        remember that when Berlioz married Henrietta Smithson she brought as
                        dowry nothing but debts; and that he had only three hundred francs

                        he was simply possessed and exhausted by his musical emotions. They were
                        really fits of ecstasy or convulsions. At first \x22there was feverish
                        excitement; the veins beat violently and tears flowed freely. Then came

                        came to anything however, for what reason is not known. The boy was
                        left now to direct his own musical studies, just when he needed an
                        expert guiding hand. He had no rivals in his native town, where he
                        sometimes appeared as a pianist. It was no wonder he thought he was on
                        the right road, and that he tried more than ever to win his mothers
                        consent to his following music as a life work.
                        And Schumann quotes these words of Ernest Wagner: \x22He who shakes off the
                        tyranny of time and delivers us from it will, as far as one can see,
                        give back freedom to music.\x22[88]
                        Mr. Stokowskis doings of the last few years can no longer be classed
                        as minor-league musical sensations. They have become Hot Hollywood
                        Stuff. First, there was his appearance in films. Then his
                        collaboration with Mickey Mouse. Then his friendship with Greta Garbo.
                        Then his five-month sentimental journey over half of Europe with the
                        Duse of the screen. Today he is as big a feature of the fan magazines
                        as Clark Gable and Robert Taylor."

  communication_note: "His love of music early showed itself in many ways. One day he
                        was assisting the parish priest at mass in the little church of
                        Le Roncole. At the moment of the elevation of the Host, such sweet
                        harmonies were sounding from the organ, that the child stood perfectly
                        motionless, listening to the beautiful music, all unconscious of
                        everything else about him.
                        Debussy composed several works for the stage, one of which was
                        \x22Martyrdom of Saint Sebastien,\x22 but his \x22Pelleas and Melisande\x22 is
                        the one supreme achievement in the lyric drama. As one of his critics
                        writes: \x22The reading of the score of Pelleas and Melisande remains
                        for me one of the most marvelous lessons in French art: it would be
                        impossible for him to express more with greater restraint of means.\x22
                        The music, which seems so complicated, is in reality very simple. It
                        sounds so shadowy and impalpable, but it is really built up with
                        as sure control as the most classic work. It is indeed music which
                        appeals to refined and sensitive temperaments.
                        In the spring of 1834 Chopin had been persuaded by Ferdinand Hiller
                        to accompany him to Aix-la-Chapelle, to attend the Lower Rhine Music
                        Festival. Before they started Chopin found he had not the money to go,
                        as it had been spent or given to some needy countryman. Hiller did not
                        like to go alone, and asked if his friend could think of no way out of
                        the dilemma. At last Chopin took the manuscript of the E flat Valse,
                        Op. 18, went with it to Pleyel the publisher, and returned with five
                        hundred francs. They could now go and enjoy the trip they had planned.

                        Majorca. Chopin went with the party and fell ill himself. There were
                        many discomforts during their travels, due to bad weather and other
                        inconveniences.

                        astonishment he had become, as he says in a letter to Faisst, a quiet,
                        sedate, and silent man, who wished more and more to be alone. He did not
                        compose anything fresh, but revised his Michelangelo _Lieder_, and had
                        them published. He made plans for the winter, and rejoiced in the
                        thought of passing it in the country near Gmunden, \x22in perfect quiet,
                        undisturbed, and living only for art.\x22 In his last letter to Faisst, 17
                        September, 1898, he says:"

                        he could not idle away his time. As he wrote later: \x22Only too soon it
                        became clear to me I had to practise just what was unpleasant. Had I
                        not inherited my mothers irrepressible energy as well as her musical

                        At the next matinee the Academy of Music was black as a crypt. On
                        the stage, at each of the players desks, hung a small, green-shaded
                        light. Then Mr. Stokowski walked out on the podium. The moment he had
                        mounted the dais, a spotlight was trained on his head, turning his
                        hair into a glittering golden halo. The ladies forgot all about their
                        friends dresses. Why, the darling boy looked like an angel descended

                        perusal of the manuals to be included in the present series. It is

                        which will be duly treated in successive volumes--will be in a better

                        race-hatred and distrust, and to what a writer in the _Musical Times_
                        (September, 1914) has called, \x22a new sense of the emotional solidarity
                        of mankind. From that sense alone,\x22 he adds, \x22can the real music of the
                        future be born.\x22
                        Wolf never chose commonplace poems for his music--which is more than can
                        be said of Schubert or Schumann. He did not use anything written by
                        contemporary poets, although he was in sympathy with some of them, such
                        as Liliencron, who hoped very much to be translated into music by him.
                        But he could not do it; he could not use anything in the work of a great
                        poet unless he became so intimate with it that it seemed to be a part of
                        him."

                        in torrents, is the cemetery of Montmartre, which is near my house.
                        I often go there; there is much that draws me to it. The day before
                        yesterday I passed two hours in the cemetery; I found a comfortable
                        seat on a costly tomb, and I went to sleep.... Paris is to me a
                        cemetery and her pavements are tomb-stones. Everywhere are memories
                        of friends or enemies that are dead.... I do nothing but suffer
                        unceasing pain and unspeakable weariness. I wonder night and day if
                        I shall die in great pain or with little of it--I am not foolish
                        enough to hope to die without any pain at all. Why are we not

                        In the autumn of 1898 Wolf was taken to an asylum at Vienna. At first he
                        was able to receive a few visits and to enjoy a little music by playing
                        duets with the director of the establishment, who was himself a musician
                        and a great admirer of Wolfs works. He was even able in the spring to
                        take a few walks out of doors with his friends and an attendant. But he
                        was beginning not to recognise things or people or even himself. \x22Yes,\x22
                        he would say, sighing, \x22if only I were Hugo Wolf!\x22 From the middle of
                        1899 his malady grew rapidly worse, and general paralysis followed. At
                        the beginning of 1900 his speech was affected, and, finally, in August,
                        1901, all his body. At the beginning of 1902 all hope was given up by
                        the doctors; but his heart was still sound, and the unhappy man dragged
                        out his life for another year. He died on 16 February, 1903, of
                        peripneumonia.
                        They stood in speechless astonishment at this proof of the childs
                        powers; then Leopold Mozart caught up the little composer and kissing
                        him cried, \x22My Wolfgang, you will become a great musician.\x22"

  communication_note: "But the musical part of _Tristan_ is not free either from the faults of
                        the work as a whole, for it, too, lacks unity. Wagners music is made up
                        of very diverse styles: one finds in it Italianisms and Germanisms and
                        even Gallicisms of every kind; there are some that are sublime, some
                        that are commonplace; and at times one feels the awkwardness of their
                        union and the imperfections of their form. Then again, perhaps two ideas
                        of equal originality come together and spoil each other by making too
                        strong a contrast. The fine lamentation of King Mark--that
                        personification of a knight of the Grail--is treated with such
                        moderation and with so noble a scorn for outward show, that its pure,
                        cold light is entirely lost after the glowing fire of the duet.
                        During his long convalescence he was seized with a great desire for
                        knowledge, and read everything he could lay hands on. He would often
                        sit at the piano, busying his fingers with technic while reading a
                        book on the desk before him. He had formerly given all his time to
                        music and languages; now he must know literature, politics, history
                        and exact sciences. A word casually dropped in conversation, would
                        start him on a new line of reading. Then came the revolution of 1830.
                        Everybody talked politics, and Franz, with his excitable spirits,
                        would have rushed into the conflict if his mother had not restrained
                        him.
                        The country about Liege was peculiarly French, not only in outward
                        appearance, but in language and sentiment. Here were low hills covered
                        with pines and beeches, here charming valleys; there wide plains
                        where the flowering broom flourished in profusion. It was the Walloon
                        country, and the Francks claimed descent from a family of early
                        Walloon painters of the same name. The earliest of these painters was
                        Jerome Franck, born away back in 1540. Thus the name Franck had stood
                        for art ideals during a period of more than two and a half centuries."

                        von Meysenbug told me that at the Bayreuth festival of 1876, while she
                        was following one of the _Ring_ scenes very attentively with her
                        opera-glasses, two hands were laid over her eyes, and she heard Wagners
                        voice say impatiently: \x22Dont look so much at what is going on. Listen!\x22
                        It was good counsel. There are dilettanti who pretend that at a concert
                        the best way to enjoy Beethovens last works--where the sonority is
                        defective--is to stop the ears and read the score. One might say with
                        less of a paradox that the best way to follow a performance of Wagners
                        operas is to listen with the eyes shut. So perfect is the music, so
                        powerful its hold on the imagination, that it leaves nothing to be
                        desired; what it suggests to the mind is infinitely finer than what the
                        eyes may see. I have never shared the opinion that Wagners works may
                        be best appreciated in the theatre. His works are epic symphonies. As a
                        frame for them I should like temples; as scenery, the illimitable land
                        of thought; as actors, our dreams."

  communication_note: "A couple of years before he passed away, Tschiakowsky came to America.
                        In May, 1891, he conducted four concerts connected with the formal
                        opening of Carnegie Hall, New York. We well remember his interesting
                        personality, as he stood before the orchestra, conducting many of his
                        own works, with Adele Aus der Ohe playing his famous Concerto in B
                        flat minor.
                        Robert began to realize more and more his lack of thorough theoretical
                        knowledge and applied to Dorn, who stood high in the musical
                        profession in Leipsic. On his introduction, in spite of his lame hand
                        he played his \x22Abegg Variations,\x22 published as Op. 1, and Dorn was
                        willing to accept the timid quiet youth as pupil. He studied with
                        great ardor, going from the A.B.C. to the most involved counterpoint.
                        The hallucinations which had before obsessed him now returned with
                        alarming force. He could no longer sleep--he seemed to be lost in
                        mental darkness."

  communication_note: "Cesar Franck was then organist in the church of Notre Dame de Lorette,
                        and the marriage took place there, February 22, 1848, in the very
                        thick of the revolution. Indeed, to reach the church, the wedding
                        party were obliged to climb a barricade, helped over by the
                        insurgents, who were massed behind this particular fortification.
                        Berlioz, like most composers, always wished to produce an opera.
                        \x22Benvenuto Cellini\x22 was the subject finally chosen. It took a long
                        time to write, and perhaps would never have been finished, since
                        Berlioz was so tied to bread-winning journalistic labors, if a kind
                        friend--Ernest Legouve--had not offered to lend him two thousand
                        francs. This loan made him independent for a little time, and gave him
                        the necessary leisure in which to compose."

                        11, 1830. Chopin requested Constantia Gladowska, whom he had never
                        met, to sing an aria. In the success of the evening sorrow was
                        forgotten. He wrote to his friend: \x22Miss Gladowska wore a white gown

  communication_subject: "The zenith of Berliozs genius was reached, when he was thirty-five years old, with the _Requiem_ and _Romeo_."
  communication_note: "One of the most tragic episodes of his life is that of the symphony
                        which he did not write because of his poverty. One wonders why the page
                        that finishes his _Memoires_ is not better known, for it touches the
                        depths of human suffering.
                        On the way to Pressburg, the first stop, they halted to call at
                        Eisenstadt, on Prince Esterhazy. The boy played for his delighted
                        host, who gave him every encouragement, even to placing his castle at
                        Pressburg at his disposal for a concert. The Princess, too, was most
                        cordial, and gave the boy costly presents when they left.
                        It proved an epoch-making occasion. For this first success as
                        conductor led him to undertake a three months tour through western
                        Europe in 1888. On his return to St. Petersburg he conducted a program
                        of his own compositions for the Philharmonic Society, which was
                        also successful, in spite of the intense nervousness which he always
                        suffered. As a result of his concert he received offers to conduct
                        concerts in Hamburg, Dresden, Leipsic, Vienna, Copenhagen and London,
                        many of which he accepted.
                        On one of these tours he arrived in Dresden in time to learn of a
                        French player who had just come to town. Jean Marchand had won a great
                        reputation in France, where he was organist to the King at Versailles,
                        and regarded as the most fashionable musician of the day. All this had
                        made him very conceited and overbearing. Every one was discussing the
                        Frenchmans wonderful playing and it was whispered he had been offered
                        an appointment in Dresden."

  communication_note: "Arrived at Vienna, Leopold Mozart found the fame of the childrens
                        playing had preceded them. A kind and gracious welcome awaited the
                        little party when they went to the palace of Schenbrunn. The Emperor
                        Franz Josef took to Wolfgang at once, was delighted with his playing
                        and called him his \x22little magician.\x22 The boys powers were tested by
                        being required to read difficult pieces at sight, and playing with one
                        finger, as the Emperor jestingly asked him to do. Next, the keyboard
                        was covered with a cloth, as a final test, but little Wolfgang played
                        as finely as before, to the great delight of the company who applauded
                        heartily. The little magician was so pleased with the kindness of both
                        the Emperor and Empress that he returned it in his own childish way,
                        by climbing into the lap of the Empress and giving her a hug and a
                        kiss, just as though she were his own mother. He was also greatly
                        attracted by the little Princess Marie Antoinette, a beautiful child
                        of about his own age, with long fair curls and laughing blue eyes. The
                        two struck up an immediate friendship.
                        In 1847, we find Verdi in London, where on July 2, at Her Majestys
                        Theater, \x22I Masnadieri\x22 was brought out, with a cast including
                        Lablanche, Gardoni, Colletti, and above all Jenny Lind, in a part
                        composed expressly for her. All the artists distinguished themselves;
                        Jenny Lind acted admirably and sang her airs exquisitely, but the
                        opera was not a success. No two critics could agree as to its merits.
                        Verdi left England in disgust and took his music to other cities.
                        [Footnote 21: From this womans nature came his love of revenge, \x22a
                        thing needless, and yet necessary,\x22 he said to his friend Hiller, who,
                        after having made him write the _Symphonie fantastique_ to spite
                        Henrietta Smithson, next made him write the wretched fantasia _Euphonia_
                        to spite Camille Moke, now Mme. Pleyel. One would feel obliged to draw
                        more attention to the way he often adorned or perverted the truth if one
                        did not feel it arose from his irrepressible and glowing imagination far
                        more than from any intention to mislead; for I believe his real nature
                        to have been a-very straightforward one. I will quote the story of his
                        friend Crispino, a young countryman from Tivoli, as a characteristic
                        example. Berlioz says in his _Memoires_ (I, 229): \x22One day when Crispino
                        was lacking in respect I made-him a present of two shirts, a pair of
                        trousers, and three good kicks behind.\x22 In a note he added, \x22This is a
                        lie, and is the result of an artists tendency to aim at effect. I never
                        kicked Crispino.\x22 But Berlioz took care afterwards to omit this note.
                        One attaches as little importance to his other small boasts as to this
                        one. The errors in the _Memoires_ have been greatly exaggerated; and
                        besides, Berlioz is the first to warn his readers that he only wrote
                        what pleased him, and in his preface says that he is not writing his
                        Confessions. Can one blame him for that?]
                        In 1827, Chopin finished his studies at the Lyceum and determined
                        to adopt music as his profession. He was now seventeen, of slender
                        figure, finely cut features, high forehead, delicate brows above
                        dreamy, soulful eyes. Though not weak or sickly, as some accounts make
                        out, he was never very robust; he would far rather lie under beautiful
                        trees in delightful day dreams, than take long excursions afoot. One
                        of his aversions was smoking or tobacco in any form; he never used it
                        in his whole life. He was vivacious, active, hard working at music and
                        reasonably healthy in early youth, but not of a hardy organism. His
                        mother and sisters constantly cautioned him to wrap up in cold or damp
                        weather, and like an obedient son and good brother, he obeyed."

                        Thus music had almost come back to its own, as far as the higher kind of
                        teaching and the intellectual world were concerned. It remained for a
                        place to be found for it in other kinds of teaching; for there, and
                        especially in secondary education, its advance was less sure. It
                        remained for us to make it enter into the life of the nation and into
                        the peoples education. This was a difficult task, for in France art has
                        always had an aristocratic character; and it was a task in which neither
                        the State nor musicians were very interested. The Republic still
                        continued to regard music as something outside the people. There had
                        even been opposition shown during the last thirty years towards any
                        attempt at popular musical education. In the old days of the Pasdeloup
                        concerts one could pay seventy-five centimes for the cheapest places,
                        and have a seat for that; but at some of the symphony concerts to-day
                        the cheapest seats are two and four francs. And so the people that
                        sometimes came to the Pasdeloup concerts never come at all to the big
                        concerts to-day.
                        Surrounded by refined, cultivated people, in an atmosphere at once
                        moral and intellectual, little Frederic passed a fortunate childhood.
                        He soon manifested such fondness for music, especially for the piano,
                        that his parents allowed him to have lessons, his teacher being
                        Adalbert Zywny, the best-known master of the city. It is related that
                        Zywny only taught his little pupil first principles, for the childs
                        progress was so extraordinary that before long he had mastered all
                        his teacher could impart, and at twelve he was left to shape his own
                        musical destiny."

                        Leopold and Marianne journeyed to Munich to witness Wolfgangs
                        triumph. It was a proud, happy moment for all three; the enthusiastic
                        acclaim which shook the theater seemed to the old father, who watched
                        with swimming eyes the sea of waving hands around him, to set the seal
                        of greatness on his sons career."

                        years; it was thinking, too, of the restoration of the Gregorian chant
                        during 1850 and 1860 by Dom Gueranger, the first abbot of Solesmes, a
                        work continued by Dom Jausions and Dom Pothier, the abbot of
                        Saint-Wandrille, who published in 1883 the _Melodies Gregoriennes_, the
                        _Liber Gradualis_, and the _Liber Antiphonarius_. This work was finally
                        brought to a happy conclusion by Dom Schmitt, and Dom Mocqucreau, the
                        prior of Solesmes, who in 1889 began his monumental work, the
                        _Paleo-graphie Musicals_, of which nine volumes had appeared in 1906.

  communication_note: "But it is especially by the manner in which they conceive the respective
                        relationships of poetry and music to opera that the two composers
                        differ. With Wagner, music is the kernel of the opera, the glowing
                        focus, the centre of attraction; it absorbs everything, and it stands
                        absolutely first. But that is not the French conception. The musical
                        stage, as we conceive it in France (if not what we actually possess),
                        should present such a combination of the arts as go to make an
                        harmonious whole. We demand that an equal balance shall be kept between
                        poetry and music; and if their equilibrium must be a little upset, we
                        should prefer that poetry was not the loser, as its utterance is more
                        conscious and rational. That was Glucks aim; and because he realised it
                        so well he gained a reputation among the French public which nothing
                        will destroy. Debussys strength lies in the methods by which he has
                        approached this ideal of musical temperateness and disinterestedness,
                        and in the way he has placed his genius as a composer at the service of
                        the drama. He has never sought to dominate Maeterlincks poem, or to
                        swallow it up in a torrent of music; he has made it so much a part of
                        himself that at the present time no Frenchman is able to think of a
                        passage in the play without Debussys music singing at the same time
                        within him.
                        Richard Strauss is both a poet and a musician. These two natures live
                        together in him, and each strives to get the better of the other. The
                        balance is not always well maintained; but when he does succeed in
                        keeping it by sheer force of will the union of these two talents,
                        directed to the same end, produces an effect more powerful than any
                        known since Wagners time. Both natures have their source in a mind
                        filled with heroic thoughts--a rarer possession, I consider, than a
                        talent for either music or poetry. There are other great musicians in
                        Europe; but Strauss is something more than a great musician, for he is
                        able to create a hero."

  communication_note: "There were many noted musicians in the French capital at that time,
                        and many opportunities for success. The young German produced his
                        letters of introduction and received many promises of assistance from
                        conductors and directors. Delighted with his prospects he located in
                        the \x22heart of elegant and artistic Paris,\x22 without regarding cost.
                        The Lamoureux Concerts have not had as stable a dwelling-place as the
                        Chatelet Concerts. They have wandered about Paris from one room to
                        another--from the Cirque dHiver to the Cirque dEte, and from the
                        Chateau-dEau to the Nouveau Theatre. At the present moment they are in
                        the Salle Gaveau, which is much too small for them. In spite of the
                        progress of music and musical taste, Paris has not yet a concert-hall,
                        as the smallest provincial towns in Germany have; and this shameful
                        indifference, unworthy of the artistic renown of Paris, obliges the
                        symphonic societies to take refuge in circuses or theatres, which they
                        share with other kinds of performers, though the acoustics of these
                        places are not intended for concerts. And so it happens that for six
                        years the Chevillard Concerts have been given at the back of a
                        music-hall, which has the same entrance, and which is only separated
                        from the concert-room by a small passage, so that the roaring choruses
                        of a _danse du venire_ may mingle with an adagio of Beethovens or a
                        scene from the Tetralogy. Worse than this, the smallness of the place
                        into which these concerts have been crammed has been a serious obstacle
                        in the way of making them popular. Nevertheless, in the promenade and
                        galleries of the Nouveau Theatre, in later years, arose what may be
                        called a little war over concertos. It was rather a curious episode in
                        the history of the musical taste of Paris, and merits a few words here.
                        In every country, but especially in those countries that are least
                        musical, a virtuoso profits by public favour, often to the detriment of
                        the work he is performing; for what is most liked in music is the
                        musician. The virtuoso--whose importance must not be underrated, and who
                        is worthy of honour when he is a reverential and sympathetic interpreter
                        of genius--has too often taken a lamentable part, especially in Latin
                        countries, in the degrading of musical taste; for empty virtuosity makes
                        a desert of art. The fashion of inept fantasias and acrobatic
                        variations has, it is true, gone by; but of late years virtuosity has
                        returned in an offensive way, and, sheltering itself under the solemn
                        classical name of \x22concertos,\x22 it usurped a place of rather exaggerated
                        importance in symphony concerts, and especially in M. Chevillards
                        concerts--a place which Lamoureux would never have given it. Then the
                        younger and more enthusiastic part of the public began to revolt; and
                        very soon, with perfect impartiality and quite indiscriminately, began
                        to hiss famous and obscure virtuosi alike in their performance of any
                        concerto, whether it was splendid or detestable. Nothing found favour
                        with them--neither the playing of Paderewski, nor the music of
                        Saint-Saens and the great masters. The management of the concerts went
                        its own way and tried in vain to put out the disturbers, and to forbid
                        them entry to the concert-room; and the battle went on for a long time,
                        and critics were drawn into it. But in spite of its ridiculous excesses,
                        and the barbarism of the methods by which the parterre expressed its
                        opinions, that quarrel is not without interest. It proved how a passion
                        and enthusiasm for music had been roused in France; and the passion,
                        though unjust in its expression, was more fruitful and of far greater
                        worth than indifference."

                        given a very simple burial. In 1820 Prince Esterhazy had the remains
                        reinterred in the upper parish church at Eisenstadt, where a simple
                        stone with Latin inscription is placed in the wall above the vault to
                        mark the spot.

                        may lie awake all night, worrying over two possible tempi in which
                        he might have taken some passage--shadings in rhythm that the average

                        Resurrection of Lazarus_, _The Resurrection of Christ_. Now he is at
                        work on the fifth--_The Nativity_.
                        The Kings birthday was to be celebrated on June 4 and London was
                        crowded with people from all parts of the country. Leopold Mozart had
                        chosen June 5 as the date for his first public concert. The hall was
                        filled to overflowing; one hundred guineas being taken in. Many of the
                        assisting performers would take no fee for their services, which added
                        to the fathers gratitude and happiness.
                        The truth was that school life was very unsympathetic to him,
                        very narrow and mechanical, and it is no wonder that he took every
                        opportunity to escape and play truant. He loved poetry and knew
                        all the poems in the reading books by heart; he was fond, too, of
                        declaiming them in season and out of season.
                        Well, here is that music; you will nowhere find a more perfect model. It
                        is true that many who profess the principles of this music repudiate
                        the model, and do not hide their disdain for Berlioz. That makes me
                        doubt a little, I admit, the results of their efforts. If they do not
                        feel the wonderful freedom of Berliozs music, and do not see that it
                        was the delicate veil of a very living spirit, then I think there will
                        be more of archaism than real life in their pretensions to \x22free music.\x22
                        Study, not only the most celebrated pages of his work, such as the
                        _Scene damour_ (the one of all his compositions that Berlioz himself
                        liked best),[85] _La Tristesse de Romeo_, or _La Fete des Capulet_
                        (where a spirit like Wagners own unlooses and subdues again tempests of
                        passion and joy), but take less well-known pages, such as the
                        _Scherzetto chante de la reine Mab_, or the _Reveil de Juliette_, and
                        the music describing the death of the two lovers.[86] In the one what
                        light grace there is, in the other what vibrating passion, and in both
                        of them what freedom and apt expression of ideas. The language is
                        magnificent, of wonderful clearness and simplicity; not a word too much,
                        and not a word that does not reveal an unerring pen. In nearly all the
                        big works of Berlioz before 1845 (that is up to the _Damnation_) you
                        will find this nervous precision and sweeping liberty."

                        smoke from a long stemmed pipe. Devrient unfolded the plan of bringing
                        this great work of Bach to the knowledge of the public. The old man
                        listened to their plea with growing impatience, until he became quite
                        excited, rose from his chair and paced the floor with great strides,
                        exclaiming, \x22No, it is not to be thought of--it is a mad scheme.\x22 To
                        Felix argument then seemed useless and he beckoned his friend to
                        come away, but Devrient refused to move, and kept up his persuasive
                        argument. Finally, as though a miracle had been wrought, Zelter began
                        to weaken, and at last gave in, and besides promised all the aid in
                        his power.
                        Wolfgang, not content with merely learning the piano, begged to study
                        the violin also. His violin lessons had hardly begun when one evening
                        his father and two friends were about to play a set of six trios,
                        composed by Wentzl, one of the players. Wolfgang begged to be allowed
                        to play the second violin. Needless to say his request was refused.
                        At last he was told he might sit next to Schachtner and make believe
                        play, though he must make no sound."

  communication_note: "When at last the book was in his hands, he clasped it to his breast
                        and hurried quickly back to his chamber. Placing the book on a table
                        in front of the window, where the moonlight fell full upon it, he took
                        pen and music paper and began copying out the pieces in the book.
                        For several years the leader of the young school, M. Claude Debussy,
                        has, in his writings in the _Revue Blanche_ and _Gil Blas_, attacked
                        Wagnerian art. His personality is very French--capricious, poetic, and
                        _spirituelle_, full of lively intelligence, heedless, independent,
                        scattering new ideas, giving vent to paradoxical caprice, criticising
                        the opinions of centuries with the teasing impertinence of a little
                        street boy, attacking great heroes of music like Gluck, Wagner, and
                        Beethoven, upholding only Bach, Mozart, and Weber, and loudly professing
                        his preference for the old French masters of the eighteenth century. But
                        in spite of this he is bringing back to French music its true nature and
                        its forgotten ideals--its clearness, its elegant simplicity, its
                        naturalness, and especially its grace and plastic beauty. He wishes
                        music to free itself from all literary and philosophic pretensions,
                        which have burdened German music in the nineteenth century (and perhaps
                        have always done so); he wishes music to get away from the rhetoric
                        which has been handed down to us through the centuries, from its heavy
                        construction and precise orderliness, from its harmonic and rhythmic
                        formulas, and the exercises of oratorical embroidery. He wishes that
                        all about it shall be painting and poetry; that it shall explain its
                        true feeling in a clear and direct way; and that melody, harmony, and
                        rhythm shall develop broadly along the lines of inner laws, and not
                        after the pretended laws of some intellectual arrangement. And he
                        himself preaches by example in his _Pelleas et Melisande_, and breaks
                        with all the principles of the Bayreuth drama, and gives us the model of
                        the new art of his dreams. And on all sides discerning and well-informed
                        critics, such as M. Pierre Lalo of _Le Temps_, M. Louis Laloy of the
                        _Revue Musicale_ and the _Mercure Musicale_, and M. Marnold of _Le
                        Mercure de France_, have championed his doctrines and his art. Even the
                        _Schola Cantorum_, whose eclectic and archaic spirit is very different
                        from that of Debussy, seemed at first to be drawn into the same current
                        of thought; and this school which had so helped to propagate the foreign
                        influences of the past, did not seem to be quite insensible to the
                        nationalistic preoccupation of the last few years. So the _Schola_
                        devoted itself more and more--as was moreover its right and duty--to the
                        French music of the past, and filled its concert programmes with French
                        works of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries--with Marc Antoine
                        Charpentier, Du Mont, Leclair, Clerambault, Couperin, and the French
                        primitive composers for the organ, the harpsichord, and the violin; and
                        with the works of dramatic composers, especially of the great Rameau,
                        who, after a period of complete oblivion, suddenly benefited by this
                        excessive reaction, to the detriment of Gluck, whom the young critics,
                        following M. Debussys example, severely abused.[258] There was even a
                        moment when the _Schola_ took a decided share in the battle, and,
                        through M. Charles Bordes, issued a manifesto--_Credo_, as they called
                        it--about a new art founded on the ancient traditions of French music:
                        It was soon discovered the boy had a voice, and his mother is said
                        to have sold some land she owned to provide for her sons musical
                        training."

                        nearly a third of the score. Weber took this advice, and remade parts

                        immaculate in its neatness. The brass candlesticks shone like gold,

                        been a school for public taste. One does not look for perfect execution
                        there,[232] but for intelligent interpretations and a thirst for a
                        fuller knowledge of the great works of the past. They have revived
                        Monteverdes _Orfeo_ and his _Incoronazione di Poppea_, which had been
                        forgotten these three centuries; and it was following an interest

                        their initiative, Cesar Franck, Ernest Guiraud, Massenet, Garcin,
                        Gabriel Faure, Henri Duparc, Theodore Dubois, and Taffanel, joined
                        forces with them, and at a meeting on 25 February, 1871, agreed to found
                        a musical society that should give hearings to the works of living
                        French composers exclusively. The first meetings were interrupted by the
                        doings of the Commune; but they began again in October, 1871. The
                        Societys early statutes were drawn up by Alexis de Castillon, a
                        military officer and a talented composer, who, after having served in
                        the war of 1870 at the head of the _mobiles_ of Eure-et-Loire, was one
                        of the founders of French chamber-music, and died prematurely in 1873,
                        aged thirty-five. It was these statutes, signed by Saint-Saens,
                        Castillon, and Garcin, that gave the Society its title of _Societe
                        Nationale de Musique_, and its device, \x22_Ars gallica_.\x22 This is what the
                        statutes say about the aims of the Society:"

  communication_note: "More baneful even than the influence of the theatre is the influence of
                        success. These musicians have nowadays too many facilities for having
                        their music played. A work is played almost before it is finished, and
                        the musician has no time to live with his work in solitude and silence.
                        Besides this, the works of the chief German musicians are supported by
                        tremendous booming of some kind or another: by their _Musikfeste_, by
                        their critics, their press, and their \x22Musical Guides\x22 (_Musikfuehrer_),
                        which are apologetic explanations of their works, scattered abroad in
                        millions to set the fashion for the sheep-like public. And with all this
                        a musician grows soon contented with himself, and comes to believe any
                        favourable opinion about his work. What a difference from Beethoven,
                        who, all his life, was hammering out the same subjects, and putting his
                        melodies on the anvil twenty times before they reached their final form.
                        That is where Mahler is so lacking. His subjects are a rather vulgarised
                        edition of some of Beethovens ideas in their unfinished state. But
                        Mahler gets no further than the rough sketch."

  communication_note: "After having sought the libretto of an opera from the whole world, from
                        poets ancient and modern,[189] and after having tried to write one
                        himself, he finally took that of Madame Rosa Mayreder, an adaptation of
                        a Spanish novelette of Don Pedro de Alarcon. This was _Corregidor_,
                        which, after having been refused by other theatres, was played in June,
                        1896, at Mannheim. The work was not a success in spite of its musical
                        qualities, and the poorness of the libretto helped on its failure.
                        I will not prolong a discussion where so many things must be left
                        unsaid. But I would suggest that, once and for all, we get rid of these
                        absurd endeavours to fence in art. Do not let us say: Music can....
                        Music cannot express such-and-such a thing. Let us say rather, If genius
                        pleases, everything is possible; and if music so wishes, she may be
                        painting and poetry to-morrow. Berlioz has proved it well in his
                        _Romeo_.

                        By this time his relations with Remenyi had become somewhat irksome
                        and strained and he decided to break off this connection. One morning
                        he suddenly left Weimar, and traveled to Gettingen. There he met
                        Joseph Joachim, whom he had long wished to know, and who was the
                        reigning violinist of his time. Without any announcement, Johannes
                        walked in on the great artist, and they became fast friends almost
                        at once. Joachim had never known what it was to struggle; he had had
                        success from the very start; life had been one long triumph, whereas
                        Johannes had come from obscurity and had been reared in privation. At
                        this time Johannes was a fresh faced boy, with long fair hair and deep
                        earnest blue eyes. Wellner, the distinguished musician of Cologne,
                        thus describes him: \x22Brahms, at twenty, was a slender youth, with
                        long blond hair and a veritable St. Johns head, from whose eyes shone
                        energy and spirit.\x22
                        Wolf never chose commonplace poems for his music--which is more than can
                        be said of Schubert or Schumann. He did not use anything written by
                        contemporary poets, although he was in sympathy with some of them, such
                        as Liliencron, who hoped very much to be translated into music by him.
                        But he could not do it; he could not use anything in the work of a great
                        poet unless he became so intimate with it that it seemed to be a part of
                        him."

                        it, do not wish to see it; since they cannot advance themselves, they
                        deny progress. Critics of this kind do not think favourably of Berliozs
                        dramatic and descriptive symphonies. How should they appreciate the
                        boldest musical achievement of the nineteenth century? These dreadful
                        pedants and zealous defenders of an art that they only understand after
                        it has ceased to live are the worst enemies of unfettered genius, and
                        may do more harm than a whole army of ignorant people. For in a country
                        like ours, where musical education is poor, timidity is great in the
                        presence of a strong, but only half-understood, tradition; and anyone
                        who has the boldness to break away from it is condemned without
                        judgment. I doubt if Berlioz would have obtained any consideration at
                        all from lovers of classical music in France if he had not found allies
                        in that country of classical music, Germany--\x22the oracle of Delphi,\x22
                        \x22Germania alma parens,\x22[2] as he called her. Some of the young German
                        school found inspiration in Berlioz. The dramatic symphony that he
                        created flourished in its German form under Liszt; the most eminent
                        German composer of to-day, Richard Strauss, came under his influence;
                        and Felix Weingartner, who with Charles Malherbe edited Berliozs
                        complete works, was bold enough to write, \x22In spite of Wagner and Liszt,
                        we should not be where we are if Berlioz had not lived.\x22 This unexpected
                        support, coming from a country of traditions, has thrown the partisans
                        of Classic tradition into confusion, and rallied Berliozs friends."

  communication_note: "Thus music had almost come back to its own, as far as the higher kind of
                        teaching and the intellectual world were concerned. It remained for a
                        place to be found for it in other kinds of teaching; for there, and
                        especially in secondary education, its advance was less sure. It
                        remained for us to make it enter into the life of the nation and into
                        the peoples education. This was a difficult task, for in France art has
                        always had an aristocratic character; and it was a task in which neither
                        the State nor musicians were very interested. The Republic still
                        continued to regard music as something outside the people. There had
                        even been opposition shown during the last thirty years towards any
                        attempt at popular musical education. In the old days of the Pasdeloup
                        concerts one could pay seventy-five centimes for the cheapest places,
                        and have a seat for that; but at some of the symphony concerts to-day
                        the cheapest seats are two and four francs. And so the people that
                        sometimes came to the Pasdeloup concerts never come at all to the big
                        concerts to-day.
                        The Lamoureux Concerts have not had as stable a dwelling-place as the
                        Chatelet Concerts. They have wandered about Paris from one room to
                        another--from the Cirque dHiver to the Cirque dEte, and from the
                        Chateau-dEau to the Nouveau Theatre. At the present moment they are in
                        the Salle Gaveau, which is much too small for them. In spite of the
                        progress of music and musical taste, Paris has not yet a concert-hall,
                        as the smallest provincial towns in Germany have; and this shameful
                        indifference, unworthy of the artistic renown of Paris, obliges the
                        symphonic societies to take refuge in circuses or theatres, which they
                        share with other kinds of performers, though the acoustics of these
                        places are not intended for concerts. And so it happens that for six
                        years the Chevillard Concerts have been given at the back of a
                        music-hall, which has the same entrance, and which is only separated
                        from the concert-room by a small passage, so that the roaring choruses
                        of a _danse du venire_ may mingle with an adagio of Beethovens or a
                        scene from the Tetralogy. Worse than this, the smallness of the place
                        into which these concerts have been crammed has been a serious obstacle
                        in the way of making them popular. Nevertheless, in the promenade and
                        galleries of the Nouveau Theatre, in later years, arose what may be
                        called a little war over concertos. It was rather a curious episode in
                        the history of the musical taste of Paris, and merits a few words here.
                        In every country, but especially in those countries that are least
                        musical, a virtuoso profits by public favour, often to the detriment of
                        the work he is performing; for what is most liked in music is the
                        musician. The virtuoso--whose importance must not be underrated, and who
                        is worthy of honour when he is a reverential and sympathetic interpreter
                        of genius--has too often taken a lamentable part, especially in Latin
                        countries, in the degrading of musical taste; for empty virtuosity makes
                        a desert of art. The fashion of inept fantasias and acrobatic
                        variations has, it is true, gone by; but of late years virtuosity has
                        returned in an offensive way, and, sheltering itself under the solemn
                        classical name of \x22concertos,\x22 it usurped a place of rather exaggerated
                        importance in symphony concerts, and especially in M. Chevillards
                        concerts--a place which Lamoureux would never have given it. Then the
                        younger and more enthusiastic part of the public began to revolt; and
                        very soon, with perfect impartiality and quite indiscriminately, began
                        to hiss famous and obscure virtuosi alike in their performance of any
                        concerto, whether it was splendid or detestable. Nothing found favour
                        with them--neither the playing of Paderewski, nor the music of
                        Saint-Saens and the great masters. The management of the concerts went
                        its own way and tried in vain to put out the disturbers, and to forbid
                        them entry to the concert-room; and the battle went on for a long time,
                        and critics were drawn into it. But in spite of its ridiculous excesses,
                        and the barbarism of the methods by which the parterre expressed its
                        opinions, that quarrel is not without interest. It proved how a passion
                        and enthusiasm for music had been roused in France; and the passion,
                        though unjust in its expression, was more fruitful and of far greater
                        worth than indifference.
                        What a place in my life those Sunday concerts held! All the week I lived
                        for those two hours; and when they were over I thought about them until
                        the following Sunday. The fascination of Wagners music for youth has
                        often troubled people; they think it poisons the thoughts and dulls the
                        activities. But the generation that was then intoxicated by Wagner does
                        not seem to have shown signs of demoralisation since. Why do not people
                        understand that if we had need of that music it was not because it was
                        death to us, but life. Cramped by the artificiality of a town, far from
                        action, or nature, or any strong or real life, we expanded under the
                        influence of this noble music--music which flowed from a heart filled
                        with understanding of the world and the breath of Nature. In _Die
                        Meistersinger_, in _Tristan_, and in _Siegfried_, we went to find the
                        joy, the love, and the vigour that we so lacked."

                        Paris, were represented as costing half their value, the balance being
                        paid by a Russian Countess, who was touched by his need. The generous
                        hearted Miss Stirling raised 25,000 francs for the composer, so his
                        last days were cheered by every comfort. He passed away October 17,
                        1849, and every writer agrees it was a serene passing. His face was
                        beautiful and young, in the flower-covered casket, says Liszt,
                        for friends filled his rooms with blossoms. He was buried from

                        in Germany since his death. The chief is the great biography of Herr
                        Ernst Decsey--_Hugo Wolf_ (Berlin, 1903-4). I have found this book of
                        great service; it is a work full of knowledge and sympathy. I have also
                        consulted Herr Paul Muellers excellent little pamphlet, _Hugo Wolf
                        (Moderne essays_, Berlin, 1904), and the collections of Wolfs letters,

                        Another of his admirations was for Ole Bull, the famous Norwegian
                        violinist. One day in summer, probably in 1858, when Edward was
                        about fifteen, this \x22idol of his dreams\x22 rode up to the Grieg home on
                        horseback. The family had lived for the past five years at the fine
                        estate of Landaas, near Bergen. The great violinist had just returned
                        from America and was visiting his native town, for he too was born in
                        Bergen. That summer he came often to the Griegs and soon discovered
                        the great desire of young Edward for a musical career. He got the boy
                        to improvise at the piano, and also to show him the little pieces he
                        had already composed. There were consultations with father and mother,
                        and then, finally, the violinist came to the boy, stroked his cheek
                        and announced; \x22You are to go to Leipsic and become a musician.\x22
                        Creeping noiselessly down stairs he stood before the bookcase and
                        sought the precious volume. There it was with the names of the various
                        musicians printed in large letters on the back in his brothers
                        handwriting. To get his small hands between the bars and draw the book
                        outward took some time. But how to get it out. After much labor he
                        found one bar weaker than the others, which could be bent."

  communication_subject: "Berlioz bitterly calculated that people would begin to understand him about the year 1940."
  communication_note: "When the boys reached Paris, in 1822, Hector loyally tried to keep his
                        promise to his father and threw himself into the studies which were
                        so repugnant to him. He says he might have become a common-place
                        physician after all, had he not one night gone to the opera. That
                        night was a revelation; he became half frantic with excitement and
                        enthusiasm. He went again and again. Learning that the Conservatoire
                        library, with its wealth of scores, was open to the public, he began
                        to study the scores of his adored Gluck. He read, re-read and copied
                        long parts and scenes from these wonderful scores, even forgetting
                        to eat, drink or sleep, in his wild enthusiasm. Of course, now, the
                        career of doctor must be given up; there was no question of that. He
                        wrote home that in spite of father, mother, relations and friends, a
                        musician he would be and nothing else.
                        Berlioz is thus the true inheritor of Beethovens thought. The
                        difference between a work like _Romeo_ and one of Beethovens symphonies
                        is that the former, it would seem, endeavours to express objective
                        emotions and subjects in music. I do not see why music should not follow
                        poetry in getting away from introspection and trying to paint the drama
                        of the universe. Shakespeare is as good as Dante. Besides, one may add,
                        it is always Berlioz himself that is discovered in his music: it is his
                        soul starving for love and mocked at by shadows which is revealed
                        through all the scenes of _Romeo_."

                        orchestra placed in his charge. Before long he had drilled it to a
                        high state of excellence. Many new operas were put on the stage in
                        quick succession. Thus Weber worked on with great industry for three
                        years. The success he achieved created enemies, and perhaps because of
                        intrigues, envy and ill feeling which had arisen, he resigned his
                        post in 1816. The three years in Prague had been fruitful in new
                        compositions. Several fine piano sonatas, a set of \x22National Songs,\x22
                        and the Cantata, \x22Kampf und Sieg,\x22 (Struggle and Victory). This last
                        work soon became known all over Germany and made the gifted young
                        composer very popular. During this period Weber became engaged to
                        Caroline Brandt, a charming singer, who created the title rele in his
                        opera of \x22Sylvana.\x22"

                        After remaining three years in Leneburg, Bach secured a post as
                        violinist in the private band of Prince Johann Ernst of Saxe-Weimar;
                        but this was only to fill the time till he could find a place to
                        play the instrument he so loved. An opportunity soon came. The old
                        Thuringian town Arnstadt had a new church and a fine new organ. The
                        consistory of the church were looking for a capable organist and
                        Bachs request to be allowed to try the instrument was readily
                        granted.
                        [Footnote 45: \x22 ... Qui viderit illas
                        De lacrymis factas sentiet esse meis,\x22
                        wrote Berlioz, as an inscription for his _Tristes_ in 1854.]
                        Fifteen leagues south of Vienna, amid marshy flats along the river
                        Leitha, lies the small village of Rehrau. At the end of the straggling
                        street which constitutes the village, stood a low thatched cottage
                        and next to it a wheelwrights shop, with a small patch of greensward
                        before it. The master wheelwright, Mathias Haydn, was sexton, too, of
                        the little church on the hill. He was a worthy man and very religious.
                        A deep love for music was part of the mans nature, and it was shared
                        to a large extent by his wife Maria. Every Sunday evening he would
                        bring out his harp, on which he had taught himself to play, and he
                        and his wife would sing songs and hymns, accompanied by the harp. The
                        children, too, would add their voices to the concert. The little
                        boy Josef, sat near his father and watched his playing with rapt
                        attention. Sometimes he would take two sticks and make believe play
                        the violin, just as he had seen the village schoolmaster do. And
                        when he sang hymns with the others, his voice was sweet and true. The
                        father watched the child with interest, and a new hope rose within
                        him. His own life had been a bitter disappointment, for he had been
                        unable to satisfy his longing for a knowledge of the art he loved.
                        Perhaps Josef might one day become a musician--indeed he might even
                        rise to be Capellmeister."

  communication_note: "After this event, Chopin decided the time had come for him to depart.
                        His trunk was bought, his clothing ready, pocket-handkerchiefs hemmed;
                        in fact nothing remained but the worst of all, the leave-taking. On
                        November I, 1830, Elsner and a number of friends accompanied him to
                        Wola, the first village beyond Warsaw. There they were met by a group
                        of students from the Conservatory, who sang a cantata, composed by
                        Elsner for the occasion. Then there was a banquet. During this last
                        meal together, a silver goblet filled with Polish earth was presented
                        to Chopin in the name of them all.
                        The quality that touches me most deeply in _Tristan_ is the evidence of
                        honesty and sincerity in a man who was treated by his enemies as a
                        charlatan that used superficial and grossly material means to arrest and
                        amaze the public eye. What drama is more sober or more disdainful of
                        exterior effect than _Tristan_? Its restraint is almost carried to
                        excess. Wagner rejected any picturesque episode in it that was
                        irrelevant to his subject. The man who carried all Nature in his
                        imagination, who at his will made the storms of the _Walkuere_ rage, or
                        the soft light of Good Friday shine, would not even depict a bit of the
                        sea round the vessel in the first act. Believe me, that must have been a
                        sacrifice, though he wished it so. It pleased him to enclose this
                        terrible drama within the four walls of a chamber of tragedy. There are
                        hardly any choruses; there is nothing to distract ones attention from
                        the mystery of human souls; there are only two real parts--those of the
                        lovers; and if there is a third, it belongs to Destiny, into whose hands
                        the victims are delivered. What a fine seriousness there is in this love
                        play. Its passion remains sombre and stern; there is no laughter in it,
                        only a belief which is almost religious, more religious perhaps in its
                        sincerity than that of _Parsifal_.
                        \x22Herr Wolf has lately, as a reporter, raised an irresistible laugh
                        in musical circles. So someone suggested he had better devote
                        himself to composition. The last products of his muse show that
                        this well-meant advice was bad. He ought to go back to reporting.\x22"

  communication_note: "The musical weakness of that time was a very curious thing, and has
                        given many people the impression that France has never been a musical
                        nation. Historically speaking, nothing could be more wrong. Certainly
                        there are races more gifted in music than others; but often the seeming
                        differences of race are really the differences of time; and a nation
                        appears great or little in its art according to what period of its
                        history we consider. England was a musical nation until the Revolution
                        of 1688; France was the greatest musical nation in the sixteenth
                        century; and the recent publications of M. Henry Expert have given us a
                        glimpse of the originality and perfection of the Franco-Belgian art
                        during the Renaissance. But without going back as far as that, we find
                        that Paris was a very musical town at the time of the Restoration, at
                        the time of the first performance of Beethovens symphonies at the
                        Conservatoire, and the first great works of Berlioz, and the Italian
                        Opera. In Berliozs _Memoires_ you can read about the enthusiasm, the
                        tears, and the feeling, that the performances of Glucks and Spontinis
                        operas aroused; and in the same book one sees clearly that this musical
                        warmth lasted until 1840, after which it died down little by little, and
                        was succeeded by complete musical apathy in the second Empire--an apathy
                        from which Berlioz suffered cruelly, so that one may even say he died
                        crushed by the indifference of the public. At this time Meyerbeer was
                        reigning at the Opera. This incredible weakening of musical feeling in
                        France, from 1840 to 1870, is nowhere better shown than in its romantic
                        and realistic writers, for whom music was an hermetically sealed door.

                        Hugo is supposed to have said that Germanys inferiority was measured by
                        its superiority in music.[204] \x22The elder Dumas detested,\x22 Berlioz says,
                        \x22even bad music.\x22[205] The journal of the Goncourts calmly reflects the
                        almost universal scorn of literary men for music. In a conversation
                        which took place in 1862 between Goncourt and Theophile Gautier,
                        Goncourt said:
                        1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
                        in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you AS-IS, WITH NO OTHER

                        In 1871, the Hungarian Cabinet created him a noble, with a yearly
                        pension of three thousand dollars. In 1875, he was made Director of
                        the Academy at Budapest. In addition, Liszt was a member of nearly all
                        the European Orders of Chivalry."

                        Tschaikowsky held the operas of Mozart before him as his ideal. He
                        cared little for Wagner, considering his music dramas to be built on
                        false principles. Thus his first opera, \x22Voivoda,\x22 composed in 1866,
                        evidently had his ideal, Mozart, clearly in mind. It is a somewhat
                        curious fact that Tschaikowsky, who was almost revolutionary in other
                        forms of music, should go back to the eighteenth century for his ideal
                        of opera. Soon after it was completed \x22Voivoda\x22 was accepted to be
                        produced at the Moscow Grand Theater. The libretto was written by
                        Ostrowsky, one of the celebrated dramatists of the day. The first
                        performance took place on January 30, 1869. We are told it had several
                        performances and considerable popular success. But the composer was
                        dissatisfied with its failure to win a great artistic success, and
                        burnt the score. He did the same with his next work, an orchestral
                        fantaisie, entitled \x22Fatum.\x22 Again he did the same with the score of
                        a complete opera, \x22Undine,\x22 finished in 1870, and refused at the St.
                        Petersburg Opera, where he had offered it.
                        But Gluck had one powerful opponent at the French Court, who was none
                        other than the famous Madame du Barry, the favorite of Louis XV. Since
                        the Queen had her pet musical composer, Mme. du Barry wished to have
                        hers. An Italian by birth, she could gather about her a powerful
                        Italian faction, who were bent upon opposition to the Austrian Gluck.
                        She had listened to his praises long enough, and the tremendous
                        success of \x22Alceste\x22 had been the last straw and brought things to a
                        climax. Du Barry would have some one to represent Italian music, and
                        applied to the Italian ambassador to desire Piccini to come to Paris."

  communication_note: "The _Spanisches-Liederbuch nach Heyse und Geibel_ (1889-90) had already
                        inspired Schumann, Brahms, Cornelius, and others. But none had tried to
                        give it its rough and sensual character. Mueller shows how Schumann,
                        especially, robbed the poems of their true nature. Not only did he
                        invest them with his own sentimentalism, but he calmly arranged poems of
                        the most marked individual character to be sung by four voices, which
                        makes them quite absurd; and, worse than this, he changed the words and
                        their sense when they stood in his way. Wolf, on the contrary, steeped
                        himself in this melancholy and voluptuous world, and would not let
                        anything draw him from it; and out of it he produced, as he himself
                        said proudly, some masterpieces. The ten religious songs that come at
                        the beginning of the collection suggest the delusions of mysticism, and
                        weep tears of blood; they are distressing to the ear and mind alike, for
                        they are the passionate expression of a faith that puts itself on the
                        rack. By the side of them one finds smiling visions of the Holy Family,
                        which recall Murillo. The thirty-four folk-songs are brilliant,
                        restless, whimsical, and wonderfully varied in form. Each represents a
                        different subject, a personality drawn with incisive strokes, and the
                        whole collection overflows with life. It is said that the
                        _Spanisches-Liederbuch_ is to Wolfs work what _Tristan_ is to Wagners
                        work."

  communication_note: "Another of his admirations was for Ole Bull, the famous Norwegian
                        violinist. One day in summer, probably in 1858, when Edward was
                        about fifteen, this \x22idol of his dreams\x22 rode up to the Grieg home on
                        horseback. The family had lived for the past five years at the fine
                        estate of Landaas, near Bergen. The great violinist had just returned
                        from America and was visiting his native town, for he too was born in
                        Bergen. That summer he came often to the Griegs and soon discovered
                        the great desire of young Edward for a musical career. He got the boy
                        to improvise at the piano, and also to show him the little pieces he
                        had already composed. There were consultations with father and mother,
                        and then, finally, the violinist came to the boy, stroked his cheek
                        and announced; \x22You are to go to Leipsic and become a musician.\x22
                        Liszt became fast friends with the young composer, Hector Berlioz,
                        and much influenced by his compositions, which were along new harmonic
                        lines. Chopin, the young Polish artist, now appeared in Paris, playing
                        his E minor Concerto, his Mazurkas and Nocturnes, revealing new phases
                        of art. Chopins calm composure tranquilized Liszts excitable nature.
                        From Chopin, Liszt learned to \x22express in music the poetry of the
                        aristocratic salon.\x22 Liszt ever remained a true and admiring friend of
                        the Pole, and wrote the poetic study sketch of him in 1849."

  communication_note: "Wolfs work consists chiefly, as we have already seen, of _Lieder_, and
                        these _Lieder_ are characterised by the application to lyrical music of
                        principles established by Wagner in the domain of drama. That does not
                        mean he imitated Wagner. One finds here and there in Wolfs music
                        Wagnerian forms, just as elsewhere there are evident reminiscences of
                        Berlioz. It is the inevitable mark of his time, and each great artist in
                        his turn contributes his share to the enrichment of the language that
                        belongs to us all. But the real Wagnerism of Wolf is not made up of
                        these unconscious resemblances; it lies in his determination to make
                        poetry the inspiration of music. \x22To show, above all,\x22 he wrote to
                        Humperdinck in 1890, \x22that poetry is the true source of my music.\x22
                        Who does not feel the infectious warmth and beauty of these spirited
                        words? How this force of enthusiasm and sincerity must grip all young
                        and eager hearts. \x22There are two qualities,\x22 says M. dIndy, on the last
                        page of _Cours de Composition_, \x22which a master should try to encourage
                        and develop in the spirit of the pupil, for without them science is
                        useless; these qualities are an unselfish love of art and enthusiasm for
                        good work.\x22 And these two virtues radiate from M. dIndys personality
                        as they do from his writings; that is his power."

                        teacher in the Darmstadt Conservatory, and was accepted. It meant
                        forty hours a week of drudgery, and as he preferred to live in
                        Frankfort, he made the trip each day between the two towns. Besides
                        this he went once a week to a castle about three hours away, and
                        taught some little counts and countesses, really dull and sleepy
                        children, who cared but little if anything for music. However the
                        twelve hours spent in the train each week, were not lost, as he
                        composed the greater part of his Second Modern Suite for piano, Op.
                        14; the First Modern Suite had been written in Frankfort the year
                        before. He was reading at this period a great deal of poetry, both
                        German and English, and delving into the folk and fairy lore of
                        romantic Germany. All these imaginative studies exerted great
                        influence on his subsequent compositions, both as to subject and

  communication_note: "As a child he was neither robust nor even healthy, which is not
                        surprising, since he was not allowed to run afield with other
                        children, enjoying the sweet air of nature, the flowers, the sunshine
                        and blue sky. No, he must stay indoors much of the time and find his
                        playmates among cardboard castles and painted canvas streets. This
                        treatment was not conducive to rosy cheeks and strong, sturdy little
                        legs. Then, before the delicate child was six years old, a violin was
                        put into his hand, and if his progress on it was thought to be too
                        slow by his impatient father, he was treated to raps and blows by way
                        of incentive to work yet harder. His teachers, too, were continually
                        changing, as the comedians had to travel about from place to place.
                        After awhile he was taken in hand by Michael Haydn, a brother of the
                        great Josef. Michael was a famous musician himself and seldom gave
                        lessons to any one. But he was interested in Carl and took charge of
                        his musical education for some time.
                        A short time after this the choir master of Saint Roch, suggested that
                        Hector should write a mass for Innocents Day, promising a chorus and
                        orchestra, with ample rehearsals, also that the choir boys would copy
                        the parts. He set to work with enthusiasm. But alas, after one trial
                        of the completed work, which ended in confusion owing to the countless
                        mistakes the boys had made in copying the score, he rewrote the whole
                        composition. Fearing another fiasco from amateur copyists, the young
                        composer wrote out all the parts himself. This took three months. With
                        the help of a friend who advanced funds, the mass was performed at
                        Saint Roch, and was well spoken of by the press.
                        Thus the poem of the Tetralogy was written with doubts, as he said, as
                        to whether he should abandon art and all belonging to it and become a
                        healthy, normal man--a son of nature. He began to compose the music of
                        the poem while in a state of suffering, which every day became more
                        acute."

                        to engage him as accompanist. Haydn gladly accepted at once, hoping to
                        pick up much musical knowledge in this way. Old Porpora was very
                        harsh and domineering at first, treating him more like a valet than
                        a musician. But at last he was won over by Haydns gentleness and
                        patience, until he was willing to answer all his questions and
                        to correct his compositions. Best of all he brought Haydn to the
                        attention of the nobleman in whose house he was teaching, so that
                        when the nobleman and his family went to the baths of Mannersdorf for
                        several months, Haydn was asked to go along as accompanist to Porpora.
                        But spring came, yet no employment was in sight. His sole earnings had
                        been the coppers thrown to him as he stood singing in the snow covered
                        streets, during the long cold winter. Now it was spring, and hope rose
                        within him. He had been taught to have simple faith in God, and felt
                        sure that in some way his needs would be met."

                        other than the famous Madame du Barry, the favorite of Louis XV. Since
                        the Queen had her pet musical composer, Mme. du Barry wished to have
                        hers. An Italian by birth, she could gather about her a powerful
                        Italian faction, who were bent upon opposition to the Austrian Gluck.
                        She had listened to his praises long enough, and the tremendous
                        success of \x22Alceste\x22 had been the last straw and brought things to a
                        climax. Du Barry would have some one to represent Italian music, and
                        applied to the Italian ambassador to desire Piccini to come to Paris.

                        thirty-seven francs and fifty centimes in hand. I mention this detail to
                        give an idea of the splendidly courageous and confident spirit that

                        He received a pension of a thousand florins on condition that he would
                        retain his post. But Prince Anton, who succeeded his brother, cared
                        nothing for music; Haydn was not obliged to live at the palace and
                        returned to Vienna. Several attempts had already been made to induce
                        him to visit London, but he always had refused. Now there seemed to be
                        no obstacle in the way. One day a visitor called. \x22My name is Salomon;
                        I have come from London to fetch you; we will settle terms to-morrow.\x22
                        On the sail from Calais to Dover, the composer first saw the sea and
                        was reminded of his boyish efforts to describe it in tones.
                        The Lamoureux Concerts had served their purpose, and, in their turn,
                        their heroic mission came to an end. They had forced Wagner on Paris;
                        and Paris, as always, had overshot the mark, and could swear by no one
                        but Wagner. French musicians were translating Gounods or Massenets
                        ideas into Wagners style; Parisian critics repeated Wagners theories
                        at random, whether they understood them or not--generally when they did
                        not understand them. A reaction was inevitable directly Paris was well
                        saturated with Wagner; and it came about in 1890, among a chosen few,
                        some of whom had been, and were even still, under Wagners influence. It
                        was at first only a mild reaction, and showed itself in a return to the
                        classics of the past and to the great primitives in music.
                        In March, 1895, Wolf lived once more, and in three months had written
                        the piano score of _Corregidor_. For many years he had been attracted
                        towards the stage, and especially towards light opera. Enthusiast though
                        he was for Wagners work, he had declared openly that it was time for
                        musicians to free themselves from the Wagnerian _Musik-Drama_. He knew
                        his own gifts, and did not aspire to take Wagners place. When one of
                        his friends offered him a subject for an opera, taken from a legend
                        about Buddha, he declined it, saying that the world did not yet
                        understand the meaning of Buddhas doctrines, and that he had no wish to
                        give humanity a fresh headache. In a letter to Grohe, on 28 June, 1890,
                        he says:"

  communication_note: "Of all his collections of _Lieder_, the 53 _Gedichte von Eduard Moerike,
                        komponiert fuer eine Singstimme und Klavier_ (1888), the first published,
                        is the most popular. It gained many friends for Wolf, not so much among
                        artists (who are always in the minority) as among those critics who are
                        the best and most disinterested of all--the homely, honest people who
                        do not make a profession of art, but enjoy it as their spiritual daily
                        bread. There are a number of these people in Germany, whose hard lives
                        are beautified by their love of music. Wolf found these friends in all
                        parts, but he found most of them in Swabia. At Stuttgart, at Mannheim,
                        at Darmstadt, and in the country round about these towns he became very
                        popular--the only popular musician since Schubert and Schumann. All
                        classes of society unite in loving him. \x22His _Lieder_,\x22 says Herr
                        Decsey, \x22are on the pianos of even the poorest houses, by the side of
                        Schuberts _Lieder_.\x22 Stuttgart became for Wolf, as he said himself, a
                        second home. He owes this popularity, which is without parallel in
                        Swabia, to the peoples passionate love of _Lieder_ and, above all, of
                        the poetry of Moerike, the Swabian pastor, who lives again in Wolfs
                        songs. Wolf has set to music a quarter of Moerikes poems, he has brought
                        Moerike into his own, and given him one of the first places among German
                        poets. Such was really his intention, and he said so when he had a
                        portrait of Moerike put on the title-page of the songs. Whether the
                        reading of his poetry acted as a balm to Wolfs unquiet spirit, or
                        whether he became conscious of his genius for the first time when he
                        expressed this poetry in music, I do not know; but he felt deep
                        gratitude towards it, and wished to show it by beginning the first
                        volume with that fine and rather Beethoven-like song, _Der Genesende an
                        die Hoffnung_ (\x22The Convalescents Ode to Hope\x22).
                        Hector Berlioz passed away March 8, 1869. The French Institute sent a
                        deputation, the band of the National Guard played selections from his
                        Funeral Symphony; on the casket lay wreaths from the Saint Cecilia
                        Society, from the youths of Hungary, from Russian nobles and from the
                        town of Grenoble, his old home.
                        It needed a complete upheaval of the nation--a political and moral
                        upheaval--to change that frame of mind. Some indication of the change
                        was making itself felt in the last years of the second Empire. Wagner,
                        who suffered from the hostility or indifference of the public in 1860,
                        at the time when _Tannhaeuser_ was performed at the Opera, had already
                        found, however, a few understanding people in Paris who discerned his
                        genius and sincerely admired him. The most interesting of the writers
                        who first began to understand musical emotion is Charles Baudelaire. In
                        1861, Pasdeloup gave the first _Concerts populaires de musique
                        classique_ at the Cirque dHiver. The Berlioz Festival, organised by M.
                        Reyer, on March 23rd, 1870, a year after Berliozs death, revealed to
                        France the grandeur of its greatest musical genius, and was the
                        beginning of a campaign of public reparation to his memory.
                        Verdi had now retired to his estate of SantAgata, and it was supposed
                        his career as composer had closed, as he gave his time principally
                        to the care of his domain. From time to time it was rumored he was
                        writing another opera. The rumor proved true, for on February 5, 1887,
                        when Verdi was seventy-four years old, \x22Otello\x22 was produced at La
                        Scala, Milan, amid indescribable enthusiasm. Six years later the
                        musical world was again startled and overjoyed by the production of
                        another Shakespearean opera, \x22Falstaff,\x22 composed in his eightieth
                        year. In all, his operas number over thirty, most of them serious, all
                        of them containing much beautiful music."

  communication_note: "The travelers now proceeded to Milan, where Mozart was to work on his
                        first opera, for which he had received a commission. It was a great
                        task for a boy to accomplish and we find the young composer writing
                        to his mother and sister to pray for his success. The opera was called
                        \x22Mitridate,\x22 and was finished after three months hard work. The first
                        performance was given in Milan, December 26, 1770, and was conducted
                        by Wolfgang himself. It was a proud, happy day for the father, indeed
                        for the whole family. \x22Mitridate\x22 succeeded beyond their hopes; it was
                        given twenty times before crowded houses; and its success brought an
                        election to the Accademia, and also a commission to write a dramatic
                        Serenata for an approaching royal wedding. This work also was a great
                        success. The Empress who had commissioned Mozart to compose the work
                        was so pleased, that besides the promised fee, she gave the composer a
                        gold watch with her portrait set in diamonds on the back.

                        action only; for there have always been masters among the Conservatoire
                        teaching staff who have united a fine musical culture with a
                        broad-minded and liberal spirit. But the influence of these independent
                        minds is, generally speaking, small; for they have not the disposing of
                        academic successes; and when, by exception, they have a wide influence,
                        like that of Cesar Franck, it is the result of personal work outside the
                        Conservatoire--work that is, as often as not, opposed to Conservatoire
                        principles.]

                        looked at it curiously. The sheets were bedaubed with ink stains that
                        almost concealed the notes. For the child had thrust his pen each time
                        to the bottom of the ink well, so that frequent blots on the paper
                        were the result. These did not trouble him in the least, for he
                        merely rubbed his hand over the offending blot and proceeded with his

                        Wagnerian drama is antipathetic to the spirit of French people--to their
                        artistic taste, to their ideas about the theatre, and to their musical

                        1741. Towards the end of this year he was invited to visit Ireland
                        to make known some of his works. On the way there he was detained at
                        Chester for several days by contrary winds. He must have had the score
                        of the \x22Messiah\x22 with him, for he got together some choir boys to try
                        over a few of the choral parts. \x22Can you sing at sight?\x22 was put to
                        each boy before he was asked to sing. One broke down at the start.
                        \x22What de devil you mean!\x22 cried the impetuous composer, snatching the
                        music from him. \x22Didnt you say you could sing at sight?\x22
                        This happy time was to be the last meeting between father and son.
                        Soon after Leopolds return to Salzburg, he was stricken with illness,
                        and passed away May 28, 1787. The news reached the composer shortly
                        after he had achieved one of the greatest successes of his life. The
                        performances of his latest opera, \x22The Marriage of Figaro,\x22 had been
                        hailed with delight by enthusiastic crowds in Vienna and Prague; its
                        songs were heard at every street corner, and village ale house. \x22Never
                        was anything more complete than the triumph of Mozart and his Nozze
                        di Figaro,\x22 wrote a singer and friend.--\x22And for Mozart himself, I
                        shall never forget his face when lighted up with the glowing rays of
                        genius; it is as impossible to describe as to paint sunbeams.\x22"

  communication_note: "The more one learns of the history of great artists, the more one is
                        struck by the immense amount of sadness their lives enclose. Not only
                        are they subjected to the trials and disappointments of ordinary
                        life--which affect them more cruelly through their greater
                        sensitiveness--but their surroundings are like a desert, because they
                        are twenty, thirty, fifty, or even hundreds of years in advance of their
                        contemporaries; and they are often condemned to despairing efforts, not
                        to conquer the world, but to live.
                        Well, what did it matter? Whether he wished it or not, he opened out
                        some magnificent roads for Art. He has shown the music of France the way
                        in which her genius should tread; he has shown her possibilities she had
                        never before dreamed of. He has given us a musical utterance at once
                        truthful and expressive, free from foreign traditions, coming from the
                        depths of our being, and reflecting our spirit; an utterance which
                        responded to his imagination, to his instinct for what was picturesque,
                        to his fleeting impressions, and his delicate shades of feeling. He has
                        laid the strong foundation of a national and popular music for the
                        greatest republic in Europe.

                        with the playing of the children. From here they continued their
                        journey as far as the monastery of Ips, where they expected to stay
                        for the night. It had been a wonderful day, spent in sailing down
                        the majestic Danube, till they reached the grey old building with
                        its battlemented walls. Soon after they arrived, Father Mozart took
                        Wolfgang into the chapel to see the organ.
                        It was indeed a poor garret where the Spanglers lived, but the
                        cheerful fire and warm bread and milk were luxuries to the starving
                        lad. Best of all was it to curl up on the floor, beside the dying
                        embers and fall into refreshing slumber. The next morning the world
                        looked brighter. He had made up his mind not to try and see his
                        brother; he would support himself by music. He did not know just how
                        he was going to do this, but determined to fight for it _and never
                        give in_."

  communication_note: "\x22Art, in its journey across the ages, is a microcosm which has,
                        like the world itself, successive stages of youth, maturity, and
                        old age; but it never dies--it renews itself perpetually. It is not
                        like a perfect circle; it is like a spiral, and in its growth is
                        always mounting higher. I believe in making students follow the
                        same path that art itself has followed, so that they shall undergo
                        during their term of study the same transformations that music
                        itself has undergone during the centuries. In this way they will
                        come out much better armed for the difficulties of modern art,
                        since they will have lived, so to speak, the life of art, and
                        followed the natural and inevitable order of the forms that made up
                        the different epochs of artistic development.\x22
                        Berlioz and his wife, two of the most highly strung individuals to be
                        found anywhere, were bound to have plenty of storm and stress in their
                        daily life. And so it came about that a separation, at least for a
                        time, seemed advisable. Berlioz made every provision in his power
                        for her comfort, and then started out on various tours to make his
                        compositions known. Concerts were given in Stuttgart, Heckingen,
                        Weimar, Leipsic, and in Dresden two, both very successful. Others took
                        place in Brunswick, Hamburg, Berlin, Hanover, finishing at Darmstadt,
                        where the Grand Duke insisted not only on the composer taking the full
                        receipts for the concert, but, in addition, refused to let him pay any
                        of the expenses."

                        He had hoped to obtain a place as professor on the teaching staff of
                        the institution. Failing to do this he took private pupils. One of
                        these, Miss Marian Nevins, he afterwards married. He must have been a
                        rather striking looking youth at this time. He was nineteen. Tall and
                        vigorous, with blue eyes, fair skin, rosy cheeks, very dark hair and
                        reddish mustache, he was called \x22the handsome American.\x22 He seemed
                        from the start, to have success in teaching, though he was painfully
                        shy, and always remained so.
                        The truth was that school life was very unsympathetic to him,
                        very narrow and mechanical, and it is no wonder that he took every
                        opportunity to escape and play truant. He loved poetry and knew
                        all the poems in the reading books by heart; he was fond, too, of
                        declaiming them in season and out of season.

  communication_note: "It is not, however, Perosis dramatic genius that strikes me in his
                        work; it is rather his peculiar mournfulness, which is indescribable,
                        his gift of pure poetry, and the richness of his flowing melody. However
                        deep the religious feeling in the music may be, the music itself is
                        often stronger still, and breaks in upon the drama that it may express
                        itself freely. Take, for instance, the fine symphonic passage that
                        follows the arrival of Jesus and His friends at Martha and Marys house,
                        after the death of their brother (p. 12 _et seq._ of _Lazarus_). It is
                        true the orchestra expresses regrets and sighs, the excesses of sorrow
                        mingled with words of consolation and faith, in a sort of languishing
                        funeral march that is feminine and Christian in character. This,
                        according to the composer, is a picture he has painted of the persons in
                        the drama before he makes them speak. But, in spite of himself, the
                        result is a flood of pure music, and his soul sings its own song of joy
                        and sadness. Sometimes his spirit, in its naive and delicate charm,
                        recalls that of Mozart; but his musical visions are always dominated and
                        directed by a religious strength like that of Bach. Even the portions
                        where the dramatic feeling is strongest are really little symphonies,
                        such as the music that describes the miracle in _The Transfiguration_,
                        and the illness of Lazarus. In the latter great depth of suffering is
                        expressed; indeed, sadness could not have been carried farther even by
                        Bach, and the same serenity of mind runs through its despair.
                        But his love was that of a youth who lives in dreams; it was never the
                        strong, clear-eyed passion of a man who has faced the realities of life,
                        and who sees the defects as well as the charms of the woman he loves,
                        Berlioz was in love with love, and lost himself among visions and
                        sentimental shadows. To the end of his life he remained \x22a poor little
                        child worn out by a love that was beyond him.\x22[13] But this man who
                        lived so wild and adventurous a life expressed his passions with
                        delicacy; and one finds an almost girlish purity in the immortal love
                        passages of _Les Troyens_ or the \x22_nuit sereine\x22_ of _Romeo et
                        Juliette_. And compare this Virgilian affection with Wagners sensual
                        raptures. Does it mean that Berlioz could not love as well as Wagner? We
                        only know that Berliozs life was made up of love and its torments. The
                        theme of a touching passage in the Introduction of the _Symphonic
                        fantastique_ has been recently identified by M. Julien Tiersot, in his
                        interesting book,[14] with a romance composed by Berlioz at the age of
                        twelve, when he loved a girl of eighteen \x22with large eyes and pink
                        shoes\x22--Estelle, _Stella mentis, Stella matutina_. These words--perhaps
                        the saddest he ever wrote--might serve as an emblem of his life, a life
                        that was a prey to love and melancholy, doomed to wringing of the heart
                        and awful loneliness; a life lived in a hollow world, among worries that
                        chilled the blood; a life that was distasteful and had no solace to
                        offer him in its end.[15] He has himself described this terrible \x22_mal
                        de lisolement_,\x22 which pursued him all his life, vividly and
                        minutely.[16] He was doomed to suffering, or, what was worse, to make
                        others suffer."

                        and fountains almost made him believe he was in fairyland. Of course

  communication_note: "Among those who received his direct teaching[223] were Henri Duparc,
                        Alexis de Castillon, Vincent dIndy, Ernest Chausson, Pierre de
                        Breville, Augusta Holmes, Louis de Serres, Charles Bordes, Guy Ropartz,
                        and Guillaume Lekeu. And if to these we add the pupils in the organ
                        classes, who also came under his influence, we have, among others,
                        Samuel Rousseau, Gabriel Pierne, Auguste Chapuis, Paul Vidal, and
                        Georges Marty; and also the virtuosi who were for some time intimate
                        with him, such as Armand Parent and Eugene Ysaye, to whom Franck
                        dedicated his violin sonata. And if one thinks, too, of the artists who,
                        though not his pupils, felt his power--artists such as Gabriel Faure,
                        Alexandre Guilmant, Emmanuel Chabrier, and Paul Dukas--one may see that
                        nearly the whole musical generation of Paris of that time took its
                        inspiration from Cesar Franck. And it was largely with the intention of
                        perpetuating his teaching that his pupils, Charles Bordes and Vincent
                        dIndy, and his friend, Alexandre Guilmant, founded in 1894, four years
                        after his death, the _Schola Cantorum_, which has kept his memory alive
                        ever since.
                        Of the composers two brothers, one had passed away and had left his
                        boy Carl, named after himself, as a solemn charge, to be brought up by
                        Uncle Ludwig as his own son. The composer took up this task generously
                        and unselfishly. He was happy to have the little lad near him, one of
                        his own kin to love. But as Carl grew to young manhood he proved to
                        be utterly unworthy of all this affection. He treated his good uncle
                        shamefully, stole money from him, though he had been always generously
                        supplied with it, and became a disgrace to the family. There is no
                        doubt that his nephews dissolute habits saddened the masters life,
                        estranged him from his friends and hastened his death.
                        One music drama remained to be written--his last. Failing health
                        prevented the completion of the drama until 1882. The first
                        performance of this noble work was given on July 26, followed by
                        fifteen other hearings. After the exertions attending these, Wagner
                        and his wife, their son Siegfried, Liszt and other friends, went to
                        Italy and occupied the Vendramin Palace, on the Grand Canal, Venice.
                        Here he lived quietly and comfortably, surrounded by those he loved.
                        His health failed more and more, the end coming February 13, 1883."

                        The influence of the Conservatoire is, in music especially, an influence
                        of the past and of the Government. One may say much the same of the
                        Opera. This ancient association, which bears the imposing name of
                        _Academie nationale de Musique_ and dates from 1669, is a sort of
                        national institution which is more concerned with the history of
                        official art than with living art. The satire with which Jean-Jacques
                        describes, in his _Nouvelle Heloise_, the stiff solemnity and mournful
                        pomp of its performances has not lost much of its truth. What is lacking
                        in the Opera to-day is the enthusiasm that accompanied its former
                        musical struggles in the times of the \x22_Encyclopedistes_\x22 and the
                        \x22_guerre des coins_.\x22 The great battles of art are now fought outside
                        its doors; and it has become by degrees a showy _salon_, a little faded
                        perhaps, where the public is more interested in itself than in the
                        performance. In spite of the enormous sums that it swallows up every
                        year (nearly four million francs),[213] only one or two new pieces are
                        produced in a year, and they are rarely works that are representative of
                        the modern school. And though it has at last admitted Wagners dramas
                        into its repertory, one can no longer consider these works, half a
                        century old, to be in the vanguard of music. The most esteemed masters
                        of the French school, such as Massenet, Reyer, Chausson, and Vincent
                        dIndy, had to seek refuge in the Theatre de la Monnaie at Brussels
                        before they could get their works received at the Opera in Paris. And
                        the classical composers fare no better. Neither _Fidelio_ nor Glucks
                        tragedies--with the exception of _Armide_, which was put on under
                        pressure of fashion--are represented; and when by chance they give
                        _Freischuetz_ or _Don Juan_, one wonders if it would not have been better
                        to let them rest in oblivion, rather than treat them sacrilegiously by
                        adding, cutting, introducing ballets and new recitatives, and deforming
                        their style so as to bring them \x22up to date.\x22[214]"

  communication_note: "I am not speaking of the general public only, The German public of
                        to-day are devotees of Brahms and Wagner, and everything of theirs seems
                        good to them; they have no discrimination, and, while they applaud
                        Wagner and encore Brahms, they are, in their hearts, not only frivolous,
                        but sentimental and gross. The most striking thing about this public is
                        their cult of power since Wagners death. When listening to the end of
                        _Die Meistersinger_ I felt how the haughty music of the great march
                        reflected the spirit of this military nation of shop-keepers, bursting
                        with rude health and complacent pride.
                        Just after completing his great work, The Art of Fugue, Bach became
                        totally blind, due no doubt, to the great strain he had always put
                        upon his eyes, in not only writing his own music, but in copying out
                        large works of the older masters. Notwithstanding this handicap he
                        continued at work up to the very last. On the morning of the day on
                        which he passed away, July 28, 1750, he suddenly regained his sight. A
                        few hours later he became unconscious and passed in sleep.
                        And so, to make up for the austere grandeur of _Les Beatitudes_ they had
                        it immediately followed by Gustave Charpentiers _Impressions dItalie_.
                        You should have seen the relief of the audience. At last they were to
                        have some French music--as Germans understand it. Charpentier is, of all
                        living French musicians, the most liked in Germany; he is indeed the
                        only one who is popular with artists and the general public alike. Shall
                        I say that the sincere pleasure they take in his orchestration and the
                        gay life of his subjects is enhanced a little by a slight disdain for
                        French frivolity--_waelschen Tand_?
                        \x22According to certain writers, who wish to reduce everything to a
                        dead level and deduce all things from a single cause, Cesar Franck
                        was a mystic whose true domain was religious music. Nothing could
                        be wider of the mark. The public is given to generalisations, and
                        is too easily gulled. They will judge a composer on a single work,
                        or a group of works, and class him once and for all.... In
                        reality, my father was a man of all-round accomplishments. As a
                        finished musician, he was master of every form of composition. He
                        wrote both religious and secular music--melodies, dances,
                        pastorales, oratorios, symphonic poems, symphonies, sonatas, trios,
                        and operas. He did not confine his attention to any particular kind
                        of work to the exclusion of other kinds; he was able to express
                        himself in any way he chose.\x22[226]"

                        change his views--\x22he does not pose as a reformer of anything\x22; he is
                        altogether independent, perhaps almost too much so. He seems sometimes
                        as if he did not know what to do with his liberty. Goethe would have
                        said, I think, that he needed a little more of the devil in him."

                        Hardly had he left the school when he was drafted for the army. This
                        meant several years of virtual captivity, for conscription could not
                        be avoided. The only other thing he could do was to return home and
                        become a teacher in his fathers school. He chose the lesser evil and
                        qualified at once to become his fathers assistant, which would also
                        assure him a certain amount of leisure. We can imagine him installed
                        as teacher of the infant class, and realize how distasteful was the
                        daily round of school work, and how he longed to have it over, that he
                        might put on paper all the lovely themes that had come to him through
                        the school day. Other bright spots were the happy hours he spent with
                        the Grob family, who lived also in the district of Lichtenthal.
                        The family consisted of a mother, a son and daughter. They were all
                        musical. Therese Grob had a fine voice and she enjoyed the songs
                        Schubert brought her to sing, while her brother Heinrich could play
                        both piano and cello. Many evenings filled with music were passed by
                        the young people. His friends at the Convict too, welcomed each new
                        piece he wrote. Nor did he forget his old master Holzer, the organist
                        of the little church where the composer himself regularly attended.
                        During 1814, Schubert composed his first mass, which was performed
                        October 16. It excited so much interest that it was repeated ten days
                        later at the Augustine church. Franz conducted, the choir was led
                        by Holzer, Ferdinand sat at the organ, and Therese sang the soprano
                        solos. In the audience sat old Salieri, Court Capellmeister of Vienna,
                        with whom Beethoven had studied. Salieri praised Schubert for his
                        work, and said that he should become his pupil. He kept his word and
                        gave the young composer daily lessons for some time. The father was
                        so proud and happy that he bought a five octave piano for his boy, to
                        celebrate the event.
                        Duke Wilhelm Ernst, in 1714, raised him to the position of
                        Head-Concert Master, a position which offered added privileges. Every
                        autumn he used his annual vacation in traveling to the principal towns
                        to give performances on organ and clavier. By such means he gained a
                        great reputation both as player and composer.
                        In _Heldenleben_ (\x22The Life of a Hero\x22), op. 40,[179] he recovers
                        himself, and with a stroke of his wings reaches the summits. Here there
                        is no foreign text for the music to study or illustrate or transcribe.
                        Instead, there is lofty passion and an heroic will gradually developing
                        itself and breaking down all obstacles. Without doubt Strauss had a
                        programme in his mind, but he said to me himself: \x22You have no need to
                        read it. It is enough to know that the hero is there fighting against
                        his enemies.\x22 I do not know how far that is true, or if parts of the
                        symphony would not be rather obscure to anyone who followed it without
                        the text; but this speech seems to prove that he has understood the
                        dangers of the literary symphony, and that he is striving for pure
                        music."

  communication_note: "But M. Buchor did not remain content to be a poet of popular song.
                        During the last twelve years he has made, with untiring energy, a tour
                        of all the Ecoles Normales in France, returning several times to places
                        where he found signs of good vocal ability. In each school he made the
                        pupils sing his songs--in unison, or in two or three parts, sometimes
                        massing the boys and girls schools of one town together. His ambition
                        grew with his success; and to the folk-song melodies[245] he began
                        gradually to add pieces of classical music. And to impress the music
                        better on the singers he changed the existing words, and tried to find
                        others, which by their moral and poetic beauty more exactly translated
                        the musical feeling.[246]
                        _Guntram_ was the cause of bitter disappointment to its author. He did
                        not succeed in getting it produced at Munich, for the orchestra and
                        singers declared that the music could not be performed. It is even said
                        that they got an eminent critic to draw up a formal document, which they
                        sent to Strauss, certifying that _Guntram_ was not meant to be sung. The
                        chief difficulty was the length of the principal part, which took up by
                        itself, in its musings and discourses, the equivalent of an act and a
                        half. Some of its monologues, like the song in the second act, last half
                        an hour on end. Nevertheless, _Guntram_ was performed at Weimar on 16
                        May, 1894. A little while afterwards Strauss married the singer who
                        played Freihild, Pauline de Ahna, who had also created Elizabeth in
                        _Tannhaeuser_ at Bayreuth, and who has since devoted herself to the
                        interpretation of her husbands _Lieder_."

  communication_note: "Outside the influence that the School exercises by its teaching, its
                        propaganda by means of concerts and publications is very active. From
                        its foundation up to 1904 it had given two hundred performances in one
                        hundred and thirty provincial towns; more than one hundred and fifty
                        concerts in Paris, of which fifty were of orchestral and choral music,
                        sixty of organ music, and forty of chamber-music. These concerts have
                        been well attended by enthusiastic and appreciative audiences, and have
                        been a school for public taste. One does not look for perfect execution
                        there,[232] but for intelligent interpretations and a thirst for a
                        fuller knowledge of the great works of the past. They have revived
                        Monteverdes _Orfeo_ and his _Incoronazione di Poppea_, which had been
                        forgotten these three centuries; and it was following an interest
                        created by repeated performances of Rameau at the _Schola_[233] that
                        _Dardanus_ was performed at Dijon under M. dIndys direction, _Castor
                        et Pollux_ at Montpellier under M. Charles Bordes direction, and that
                        in 1908 the Opera at Paris gave _Hippolyte et Aricie_. Branches of the
                        _Schola_ have, been started at Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Avignon,
                        Montpellier, Nancy, Epinal, Montlucon, Saint-Chamond, and
                        Saint-Jean-deLuz.[234] A publishing house has been associated with the
                        School at Paris; and from this we get Reviews, such as the _Tribune de
                        Saint-Gervais_; publications of old music, such as the _Anthologie des
                        maitres religieux primitifs des XVe, XVIe, et XVIIe siecles_, edited by
                        Charles Bordes; the _Archives des maitres de lorgue des XVIe, XVIIe, et
                        XVIIIe siecles_, edited by Alexandre Guilmant and Andre Pirro; the
                        _Concerts spirituels de la Schola_, the new editions of _Orfeo_, and the
                        _Incoronazione di Poppea_, edited by M. Vincent dIndy; and publications
                        of modern music, such as the _Collection du chant populaire_, the
                        _Repertoire moderne de musique vocale et dorgue_, and, notably, the
                        _Edition mutuelle_, published by the composers themselves, whose
                        property it is.
                        The list, here necessarily condensed, is one of impressive musical
                        achievements, which many an artist of a more placid temperament than
                        Mr. Stokowskis would have considered ample to insure his fame.
                        I have quoted this rather long passage to show how the impression made
                        by one of Rameaus operas on his contemporaries resembled that made by
                        Wagner on his enemies. It was not without reason that Rameau was said to
                        be Wagners forerunner, as Rousseau was Tolstoys forerunner.
                        To settle the argument the skeptical friend called the office of
                        the Philharmonic. Mr. Toscanini had been right about the Beethoven
                        Concerto and had correctly remembered the purely orchestral numbers as
                        well."

  communication_note: "I have tried to unearth M. dIndys strongest characteristics, and I
                        think I have found them in his faith and in his activity, I am only too
                        aware of the pitfalls that have beset me in this attempt; it is always
                        difficult to criticise a mans personality, and it is most difficult
                        when he is alive and still in the midst of his development. Every man is
                        a mystery, not only to others, but to himself. There is something very
                        presumptuous about pretending to know anyone who does not quite know
                        himself. And yet one cannot live without forming opinions; it is a
                        necessity of life. The people we see and know (or say we know), our
                        friends, and those we love, are never what we think them. Often they are
                        not at all like the portrait we conjure up; for we walk among the
                        phantoms of our hearts. But still one must go on having opinions, and go
                        on constructing and creating things, if we do not want to become
                        impotent through inertia. Error is better than doubt, provided we err in
                        good faith; and the main thing is to speak out the thing that one really
                        feels and believes. I hope M. dIndy will forgive me if I have gone far
                        wrong, and that he will see in these pages a sincere effort to
                        understand him and a keen sympathy with himself, and even with his
                        ideas, though I do not always share them. But I have always thought that
                        in life a mans opinions go for very little, and that the only thing
                        that matters is the man himself. Freedom of spirit is the greatest
                        happiness one can know; one must be sorry for those who have not got it.
                        And there is a secret pleasure in rendering homage to anothers splendid
                        creed, even though it is one that we do not ourselves profess.
                        This is how Wagner wrote to Liszt when he was finishing this amazing
                        work of art. In the same way Michelangelo wrote to his father in 1509:
                        \x22I am in agony. I have not dared to ask the Pope for anything, because
                        my work does not make sufficient progress to merit any remuneration. The
                        work is too difficult, and indeed it is not my profession. I am wasting
                        my time to no purpose. Heaven help me!\x22 For a year he had been working
                        at the ceiling of the Sixtine chapel."

                        year in the theatre there before an audience of between eight hundred
                        and a thousand teachers.
                        After a concert, keyed to feverish excitement, he often plays over
                        piano scores of every number that appeared on the program. Then he
                        may lie awake all night, worrying over two possible tempi in which
                        he might have taken some passage--shadings in rhythm that the average
                        listener would not, could not discern.
                        Johann had been doing some piano teaching when not occupied with
                        composition. But now, on the advice of his musical friends, he decided
                        to try his luck again as a concert pianist. He began by joining Frau
                        Clara and Joachim in a concert at Danzig. Each played solos. Johanns
                        were Bachs \x22Chromatic Fantaisie\x22 and several manuscript pieces of
                        his own. After this the young artist went his own way. He played with
                        success in Bremen, also in Hamburg. It is said he was always nervous
                        before playing, but especially so in his home city. However all passed
                        off well. He now settled definitely in Hamburg, making musical trips
                        to other places when necessary.
                        Lastly, the orchestration is purposely restrained, light, and divided,
                        for Debussy has a fine disdain for those orgies of sound to which
                        Wagners art has accustomed us; it is as sober and polished as a fine
                        classic phrase of the latter part of the seventeenth century. _Ne quid
                        nimis_ (\x22Nothing superfluous\x22) is the artists motto. Instead of
                        amalgamating the _timbres_ to get a massive effect, he disengages their
                        separate personalities, as it were, and delicately blends them without
                        changing their individual nature. Like the impressionist painters of
                        to-day, he paints with primary colours, but with a delicate moderation
                        that rejects anything harsh as if it were something unseemly."

                        cathedrals, and with some concertos on the organ played by the
                        composer. The performance took place, April 13, 1742. Four hundred
                        pounds were realized, which were given to charity. The success was so
                        great that a second performance was announced. Ladies were requested
                        to come without crinoline, thereby providing a hundred more seats than
                        at the first event.

                        artificial and stupid that I had great difficulty in sitting it
                        out. But my friends begged me to stay, and assured me that the

  communication_note: "[Footnote 31: I shall content myself here with noting a fact, which I
                        shall deal with more fully in another essay at the end of this book: it
                        is the decline of musical taste in France--and, I rather think, in all
                        Europe--since 1835 or 1840. Berlioz says in his _Memoires_: \x22Since the
                        first performance of _Romeo et Juliette_ the indifference of the French
                        public for all that concerns art and literature has grown incredibly\x22
                        (_Memoires_, II, 263). Compare the shouts of excitement and the tears
                        that were drawn from the dilettanti of 1830 (_Memoires_, I, 81), at the
                        performances of Italian operas or Glucks works, with the coldness of
                        the public between 1840 and 1870. A mantle of ice covered art then. How
                        much Berlioz must have suffered. In Germany the great romantic age was
                        dead. Only Wagner remained to give life to music; and he drained all
                        that was left in Europe of love and enthusiasm for music. Berlioz died
                        truly of asphyxia.]
                        But of the two deaths, how much sadder is that of the artist who was
                        without a faith, and who had neither strength nor stoicism enough to be
                        happy without one; who slowly died in that little room in the rue de
                        Calais amid the distracting noise of an indifferent and even hostile
                        Paris;[51] who shut himself up in savage silence; who saw no loved face
                        bending over him in his last moments; who had not the comfort of belief
                        in his work;[52] who could not think calmly of what he had done, nor
                        look proudly back over the road he had trodden, nor rest content in the
                        thought of a life well lived; and who began and closed his _Memoires_
                        with Shakespeares gloomy words, and repeated them when dying:--
                        The intense creative activity of 1849 was followed by a period of
                        rest when the artist pair made two trips from Dresden, early in 1850.
                        Leipsic, Bremen, and Hamburg were visited. Most of the time in Hamburg
                        was spent with Jenny Lind, who sang at his last two concerts.
                        In my opinion, _Siegfried_, in spirit and in form, stands alone in
                        Wagners work. It breathes perfect health and happiness, and it
                        overflows with gladness. Only _Die Meistersinger_ rivals it in
                        merriment, though even there one does not find such a nice balance of
                        poetry and music."

                        _Tablettes de Polymnie_ gave a curious appreciation of Beethoven, which
                        is quoted by M. Constant Pierre: \x22This composer is often grotesque and
                        uncouth, and sometimes flies majestically like an eagle and sometimes

  communication_note: "While this movement was going on in the artistic world, scholars were
                        taking their share in it, and music was beginning to invade the
                        University.
                        At Oxford, in July, he received the honorary degree of Doctor of
                        Music, and three great concerts were given in his honor, with special
                        performers brought from London. In fact the whole visit to England had
                        been such a success that he repeated the trip in 1794, and received
                        even greater honors. His symphonies were heard on all London
                        programs. He was the lion of the season, and was frequently invited to
                        Buckingham Palace to play for the King and Queen, who always urged
                        him to live in England. Haydn was now sixty-five; he had composed
                        quantities of music, but his greatest work, \x22The Creation,\x22 was not
                        yet written. While in London, Salomon had shown him a poem founded on
                        \x22Paradise Lost,\x22 written years before in the hope that Handel would
                        use it for an oratorio. Haydn decided to try his hand at oratorio on
                        this subject. As he went on, it grew to be a labor of love and prayer.
                        It was finished and performed in Vienna, March 19, 1799, and made
                        a profound impression. The composer at once began work on a second
                        oratorio, founded on Thompsons \x22Seasons.\x22 The desire for work was
                        strong within, but his health was failing. \x22The Seasons gave me my
                        finishing stroke,\x22 he often remarked to friends."

                        Finally, this Gothic spirit shows itself--in a less original way, it is
                        true--in M. dIndys religious antipathies, which, in spite of the
                        authors goodness of heart and great personal tolerance, constantly
                        break out against the two faiths that are rivals to his own; and to them
                        he attributes all the faults of art and all the vices of humanity. Each
                        has its offence. Protestantism is made responsible for the extremes of
                        individualism;[146] and Judaism, for the absurdities of its customs and
                        the weakness of its moral sense.[147] I do not know which of the two is
                        the more soundly belaboured; the second has the privilege of being so,
                        not only in writing, but in pictures.[148] The worst of it is, these
                        antipathies are apt to spoil the fairness of M. dIndys artistic
                        judgment. It goes without saying that the Jewish musicians are treated
                        with scant consideration; and even the great Protestant musicians,
                        giants in their art, do not escape rebuke. If Goudimel is mentioned, it
                        is because he was Palestrinas master, and his achievement of \x22turning
                        the Calvinist psalms into chorales\x22 is dismissed as being of little
                        importance.[149]
                        His audiences, particularly the ladies, doted on his conducting
                        technique. His slim, youthful, virile figure was held erect, his feet
                        remained still as if nailed to the floor, while his arms went through
                        a series of sensuously compelling, always graceful motions. The view
                        from the back was enhanced by the fact that the tailor who cut his
                        morning and evening coats was almost as great as Stoky himself. And
                        his hands! Ah, my dear, those hands----!"

                        song of a traveller during a storm, op. 14) is a vocal sextette with an
                        orchestral accompaniment, whose subject is taken from a poem of
                        Goethes. It was written before Strauss met Ritter, and its construction
                        is after the manner of Brahms, and shows a rather affected thought and
                        style. _Aus Italien_ (op. 16) is an exuberant picture of impressions of
                        his tour in Italy, of the ruins at Rome, the seashore at Sorrento, and
                        the life of the Italian people. _Macbeth_ (op. 23) gives us a rather
                        undistinguished series of musical interpretations of poetical subjects.
                        _Don Juan_ (op. 20) is much finer, and translates Lenaus poem into
                        music with bombastic vigour, showing us the hero who dreams of grasping
                        all the joy of the world, and how he fails, and dies after he has lost
                        faith in everything.

                        Philadelphia. He changed the seating arrangement of the orchestra. He
                        discarded the wooden amphitheatre on which, since the dark symphonic
                        ages, the players had sat in tiers, and put them on chairs directly on
                        the stage. Then he shuffled the men, making the cellos change places
                        with the second violins, the battery with the basses. There must have
                        been some merit in all this switching, for several conductors copied
                        it.
                        The nature of Paris is so complex and unstable that one feels it is
                        presumptuous to try to define it. It is a city so highly-strung, so
                        ingrained with fickleness, and so changeable in its tastes, that a book
                        that truly describes it at the moment it is written is no longer
                        accurate by the time it is published. And then, there is not only one
                        Paris; there are two or three Parises--fashionable Paris, middle-class
                        Paris, intellectual Paris, vulgar Paris--all living side by side, but
                        intermingling very little. If you do not know the little towns within
                        the great Town, you cannot know the strong and often inconsistent life
                        of this great organism as a whole.
                        These highly-strung natures are rarely able to keep up this incessant
                        struggle for very long; and the finest genius may have to reckon with
                        illness and misery and even premature death. And yet there were people

                        his affections, was far from being the most unhappy of men. In his case,
                        he possessed nothing but himself; but he possessed himself truly, and
                        reigned over the world that was within him; and no other empire could
                        ever be compared with that of his vast imagination, which stretched like
                        a great expanse of sky, where tempests raged. Until his last day the old
                        Prometheus in him, though fettered by a miserable body, preserved his
                        iron force unbroken. When dying during a storm, his last gesture was one
                        of revolt; and in his agony he raised himself on his bed and shook his

                        in that job for three years, from 1917 to 1920, but he was out of
                        sympathy with the Lenin-Trotzky regime and asked permission to leave
                        the country. It was refused because officials said, \x22Russia needs your

                        egotistic geniuses whose thoughts are fixed on his own interests, nor
                        has he one of those carnivorous minds that sees nothing, looks for
                        nothing, and relishes nothing, unless it may be afterwards useful to it.
                        His sympathies are readily with others, he is happy in giving homage to
                        their greatness, and quick to appreciate their charm. He speaks
                        somewhere of the \x22irresistible need of transformation\x22 that every artist
                        feels.[159] But in order to escape being overwhelmed by conflicting
                        elements and interests, one should have great force of feeling or will,
                        in order to be able to eliminate what is not necessary, and choose out
                        and transform what is. M. dIndy eliminates hardly anything; he makes
                        use of it. In his music he exercises the qualities of an army general:
                        understanding of his purpose and the patience to attain it, a perfect
                        knowledge of the means at his disposal, the spirit of order, and command
                        over his work and himself. Despite the variety of the materials he
                        employs, the whole is always clear. One might almost reproach him with
                        being too clear; he seems to simplify too much.
                        When he was fifteen Sebastian left his brothers roof and entered the
                        Latin school connected with the Church of St. Michael at L�neburg. It
                        was found he had a beautiful soprano voice, which placed him with the
                        scholars who were chosen to sing in the church service in return for
                        a free education. There were two church schools in Leneburg, and the
                        rivalry between them was so keen, that when the scholars sang in the
                        streets during the winter months to collect money for their support,
                        the routes for each had to be carefully marked out, to prevent
                        collision.
                        The first great symphony of this new period was _Till Eulenspiegels
                        lustige Streiche, nach alter Schelmenweise, in Rondeauform_ (\x22Till
                        Eulenspiegels Merry Pranks, according to an old legend, in rondeau
                        form\x22), op. 28.[173] Here his disdain is as yet only expressed by witty
                        bantering, which scoffs at the worlds conventions. This figure of Till,
                        this devil of a joker, the legendary hero of Germany and Flanders, is
                        little known with us in France. And so Strausss music loses much of its
                        point, for it claims to recall a series of adventures which we know
                        nothing about--Till crossing the market place and smacking his whip at
                        the good women there; Till in priestly attire delivering a homely
                        sermon; Till making love to a young woman who rebuffs him; Till making a
                        fool of the pedants; Till tried and hung. Strausss liking to present,
                        by musical pictures, sometimes a character, sometimes a dialogue, or a
                        situation, or a landscape, or an idea--that is to say, the most volatile
                        and varied impressions of his capricious spirit--is very marked here. It
                        is true that he falls back on several popular subjects, whose meaning
                        would be very easily grasped in Germany; and that he develops them, not
                        quite in the strict form of a rondeau, as he pretends, but still with a
                        certain method, so that apart from a few frolics, which are
                        unintelligible without a programme, the whole has real musical unity.
                        This symphony, which is a great favourite in Germany, seems to me less
                        original than some of his other compositions. It sounds rather like a
                        refined piece of Mendelssohns, with curious harmonies and very
                        complicated instrumentation."

                        Haydn called next day and learned the manager had written a libretto
                        of a comic opera which he called \x22The Devil on two Sticks,\x22 and was
                        looking for some one to compose the music. In one place there was to
                        be a tempest at sea, and Haydn was asked how he would represent that.
                        As he had never seen the sea, he was at a loss how to express it. The
                        manager said he himself had never seen the ocean, but to his mind it
                        was like this, and he began to toss his arms wildly about. Haydn tried
                        every way he could think of to represent the ocean, but Kurz was not
                        satisfied. At last he flung his hands down with a crash on each end
                        of the keyboard and brought them together in the middle. \x22Thats it,
                        thats it,\x22 cried the manager and embraced the youth excitedly. All
                        went well with the rest of the opera. It was finished and produced,
                        but did not make much stir, a fact which was not displeasing to the
                        composer, as he was not proud of his first attempt.
                        [Footnote 181: In _Guntram_ one could even believe that he had made up
                        his mind to use a phrase in _Tristan_, as if he could not find anything
                        better to express passionate desire.]"

  communication_note: "Bach soon began to find Arnstadt too small and narrow for his soaring
                        desires. Besides, his fame was growing and his name becoming known in
                        the larger, adjacent towns. When he was offered the post of organist
                        at St. Blasius at Melhausen, near Eisenach, he accepted at once. He
                        was told he might name his own salary. If Bach had been avaricious he
                        could have asked a large sum, but he modestly named the small amount
                        he had received at Arnstadt with the addition of certain articles of
                        food which should be delivered at his door, gratis.
                        Those traits began to come to the surface in 1922, when he had been
                        bossing the Philadelphia band for ten years. About that time he seemed
                        no longer satisfied with merely playing to his audiences--he started
                        talking to them."

  communication_note: "In May, 1824, father and son, with Erard, started for England, and on
                        June 21 Franz gave his first public concert in London. He had already
                        played for the aristocracy in private homes, and had appeared at
                        Court by command of King George IV. The concert won him great success,
                        though the English were more reserved in their demonstrations, and not
                        like the impulsive, open-hearted French people. He was happy to return
                        to Paris, after the London season, and to resume his playing in the
                        French salons.
                        But the musical part of _Tristan_ is not free either from the faults of
                        the work as a whole, for it, too, lacks unity. Wagners music is made up
                        of very diverse styles: one finds in it Italianisms and Germanisms and
                        even Gallicisms of every kind; there are some that are sublime, some
                        that are commonplace; and at times one feels the awkwardness of their
                        union and the imperfections of their form. Then again, perhaps two ideas
                        of equal originality come together and spoil each other by making too
                        strong a contrast. The fine lamentation of King Mark--that
                        personification of a knight of the Grail--is treated with such
                        moderation and with so noble a scorn for outward show, that its pure,
                        cold light is entirely lost after the glowing fire of the duet."

                        out in 1871, with great success. This proved to be the beginning of

                        felt. An exaggerated infatuation for Grieg, though limited to a small
                        number of people, was an indication of the change in public taste. In
                        1890, Cesar Franck died in Paris. Belgian by birth and temperament, and
                        French in feeling and by musical education, he had remained outside the
                        Wagnerian movement in his own serene and fecund solitude. To his
                        intellectual greatness and the charm his personal genius held for the
                        little band of friends who knew and revered him he added the authority
                        of his knowledge. Unconsciously he brought back to us the soul of
                        Sebastian Bach, with its infinite richness and depth; and through this
                        he found himself the head of a school (without having wished it) and the
                        greatest teacher of contemporary French music. After his death, his
                        name was the means of rallying together the younger school of
                        musicians. In 1892, the _Chanteurs de Saint-Gervais_, under the
                        direction of M. Charles Bordes, reinstated to honour and popularised
                        Gregorian and Palestrinian music; and, following the initiative of their
                        director, the _Schola Cantorum_ was founded in 1894 for the revival of
                        religious music. Ambition grew with success; and from the _Schola_
                        sprang the _Ecole Superieure de Musique_, under the direction of
                        Francks most famous pupil, M. Vincent dIndy. This school, founded on a
                        solid knowledge, not only of the classics, but of the primitives in
                        music, took from its very beginning in 1900 a frankly national
                        character, and was in some ways opposed to German art. At the same time,
                        performances of Bach and seventeenth-and eighteenth-century music became
                        more and more frequent; and more intimate relationship with the artists
                        of other countries, repeated visits of the great _Kapellmeister_,
                        foreign virtuosi and composers (especially Richard Strauss), and,
                        lastly, of Russian composers, completed the education of the Parisian
                        musical public, who, after repeated rebukes from the critics, became
                        conscious of the awakening of a national personality, and of an
                        impatient desire to free itself from German tutelage. By turns it
                        gratefully and warmly received M. Bruneaus _Le Reve_ (1891), M.
                        dIndys _Fervaal_ (1898), M. Gustave Charpentiers _Louise_ (1900)--all
                        of which seemed like works of liberation. But, as a matter of fact,
                        these lyric dramas were by no means free from foreign influences, and
                        especially from Wagnerian influences. M. Debussys _Pelleas et
                        Melisande_, in 1902, seemed to mark more truly the emancipation of
                        French music. From this time on, French music felt that it had left
                        school, and claimed to have founded a new art, which reflected the
                        spirit of the race, and was freer and suppler than the Wagnerian art.
                        These ideas, which were seized upon and enlarged by the press, brought
                        about rather quickly a conviction in French artists of Frances
                        superiority in music. Is that conviction justified? The future alone can
                        tell us. But one may see by this brief outline of events how real is the
                        evolution of the musical spirit in France since 1870, in spite of the
                        apparent contradictions of fashion which appear on the surface of art.
                        It is the spirit of France that is, after long oppression and by a
                        patient but eager initiation, realising its power and wishing to
                        dominate in its turn.
                        On the third floor of the house which contained the garret, lived a
                        celebrated Italian poet, Metastasio. Haydn and the poet struck up an
                        acquaintance, which resulted in the musicians introduction to the
                        poets favorite pupil, Marianne Martinez. Also through Metastasio,
                        Haydn met Nicolo Porpora, an eminent teacher of singing and
                        composition. About this time another avenue opened to him. It was a
                        fashion in Vienna to pick up a few florins by serenading prominent
                        persons. A manager of one of the principal theaters in Vienna, Felix
                        Kurz, had recently married a beautiful woman, whose loveliness was
                        much talked of. It occurred to Haydn to take a couple of companions
                        along and serenade the lady, playing some of his own music. Soon after
                        they had begun to play the house door opened and Kurz himself stood
                        there in dressing gown and slippers. \x22Whose music was that you were
                        playing?\x22 he asked. \x22My own,\x22 was the answer. \x22Indeed; then just step
                        inside.\x22 The three entered, wondering. They were presented to Madame,
                        then were given refreshments. \x22Come and see me to-morrow,\x22 said Kurz
                        when the boys left; \x22I think I have some work for you.\x22"

                        The music of Berlioz is conceived on large lines, in broad masses of
                        tone color, with new harmonies and imposing effects. He won a noble
                        place in art through many trials and hardships. His music is the
                        expression, the reflection of the mental struggles of a most intense
                        nature. The future will surely witness a greater appreciation of its
                        merits than has up to now been accorded it.
                        In 1871, the Hungarian Cabinet created him a noble, with a yearly
                        pension of three thousand dollars. In 1875, he was made Director of
                        the Academy at Budapest. In addition, Liszt was a member of nearly all
                        the European Orders of Chivalry.
                        [Footnote 234: One may add to this list the choral societies of Nantes
                        and Besancon, which are bodies of the same order as the _Chanteurs de
                        Saint-Gervais_. And we may also attribute to the influence of the
                        _Schola_ an independent society, the _Societe J.S. Bach_, started in
                        Paris by an old _Schola_ pupil, M. Gustave Bret, which, since 1905, has
                        devoted itself to the performance of the great works of Bach. It is not
                        one of the least merits of the _Schola_ that it has helped to form good
                        amateur choirs of the same type as the choral societies of Germany.]"

                        it; you should have been bold. Ah, young man, you who call me coward
                        did not have to look upon what I did; had you done so you, too, would
                        have had no choice. My wife was there, half dead, only able to moan; she
                        had to have three nurses, and a doctor every day to visit her; and I was
                        sure of the disastrous result of any musical adventure. No, I was not a
                        coward; I know I was only human. I like to believe that I honoured art
                        in proving that she had left me enough reason to distinguish between
                        courage and cruelty\x22 (_Memoires_, II, 350).]
                        His will had to be obeyed, there was no help for it. In the case of
                        Cesar, however, a musician was what he most desired to become, so that
                        music study was always a delight.
                        For the piano, his chosen instrument, Liszt wrote much that was
                        beautiful and inspiring. He created a new epoch for the virtuoso. His
                        fifteen Hungarian Rhapsodies, B minor Sonata, Concert etudes and many
                        transcriptions, appear on all modern programs, and there are many
                        pieces yet to be made known. He is the originator of the Symphonic
                        Poem, for orchestra; while his sacred music, such as the Oratorio
                        \x22Christus,\x22 and the beautiful \x22Saint Elizabeth,\x22 a sacred opera, are
                        monuments to his great genius."

                        mental consumption, which makes me very seriously think of quitting
                        this world for ever.... Only those who truly live should live at
                        all. I have been for some time like one who is dead. I only wish it
                        were an apparent death; but I am really dead and buried; though the
                        power to control my body gives me a seeming life. It is my inmost,

                        has already passed. For the last fifteen days I have been living at
                        Traunkirchen, the pearl of Traunsee.... All the comforts that a man
                        could wish for are here to make my life happy--peace, solitude,
                        beautiful scenery, invigorating air, and everything that could suit
                        the tastes of a hermit like myself.[187] And yet--and yet, my
                        friend, I am the most miserable creature on earth. Everything
                        around me breathes peace and happiness, everything throbs with life

                        a beast that is deaf and senseless. Even reading hardly serves to
                        distract me now, though I bury myself in books in my despair. As
                        for composition, that is finished; I can no longer bring to mind
                        the meaning of a harmony or a melody, and I almost begin to doubt
                        if the compositions that bear my name are really mine. Good God!
                        what is the use of all this fame? What is the good of these great

                        arrived in Paris in September, 1839. Before him lay, if he had but

                        And _Siegfried_ rouses ones admiration the more when one thinks that it
                        was the offspring of sickness and suffering. The time at which Wagner
                        wrote it was one of the saddest in his life. It often happens so in art.
                        One goes astray in trying to interpret an artists life by his work, for
                        it is exceptional to find one a counterpart of the other. It is more
                        likely that an artists work will express the opposite of his life--the
                        things that he did not experience. The object of art is to fill up what
                        is missing in the artists experience: \x22Art begins where life leaves
                        off,\x22 said Wagner. A man of action is rarely pleased with stimulating
                        works of art. Borgia and Sforza patronised Leonardo. The strong,
                        full-blooded men of the seventeenth century; the apoplectic court at
                        Versailles (where Fagons lancet played so necessary a part); the
                        generals and ministers who harassed the Protestants and burned the
                        Palatinate--all these loved pastorales. Napoleon wept at a reading of
                        _Paul et Virginie_, and delighted in the pallid music of Paesiello. A
                        man wearied by an over-active life seeks repose in art; a man who lives
                        a narrow, commonplace life seeks energy in art. A great artist writes a
                        gay work when he is sad, and a sad work when he is gay, almost in spite
                        of himself. Beethovens symphony _To Joy_ is the offspring of his
                        misery; and Wagners _Meistersinger_ was composed immediately after the
                        failure of _Tannhaeuser_ in Paris. People try to find in _Tristan_ the
                        trace of some love-story of Wagners, but Wagner himself says: \x22As in
                        all my life I have never truly tasted the happiness of love, I will
                        raise a monument to a beautiful dream of it: I have the idea of _Tristan
                        und Isolde_ in my head.\x22 And so it was with his creation of the happy
                        and heedless _Siegfried_.
                        Franz Liszt passed away August 1, 1886, in the house of his friend,
                        Herr Frohlich, near Wagners Villa Wahnfried, Bayreuth, at the age of
                        seventy-five. As was his custom every summer, Liszt was in Bayreuth,
                        assisting in the production of Wagners masterpieces, when he
                        succumbed to pneumonia. Thus passed a great composer, a world famous
                        piano virtuoso, and a noble and kindly spirit.
                        \x22The aim of the Society is to aid the production and the
                        popularisation of all serious musical works, whether published or
                        unpublished, of French composers; to encourage and bring to light,
                        so far as is in its power, all musical endeavour, whatever form it
                        may take, on condition that there is evidence of high, artistic
                        aspiration on the part of the author.... It is in brotherly love,
                        with complete forgetfulness of self, and with the firm intention of
                        aiding one another as far as they can, that the members of the
                        Society will co-operate, each in his own sphere of action, for the
                        study and performance of the works which they shall be called upon
                        to select and to interpret.\x22"

  communication_note: "Soon after he entered St. Michaels, Bach lost his beautiful soprano
                        voice; his knowledge of violin and clavier, however, enabled him
                        to keep his place in the school. The boy worked hard at his musical
                        studies, giving his spare time to the study of the best composers. He
                        began to realize that he cared more for the organ than for any other
                        instrument; indeed his love for it became a passion. He was too
                        poor to take lessons, for he was almost entirely self-dependent--a
                        penniless scholar, living on the plainest of fare, yet determined to
                        gain a knowledge of the music he longed for.
                        There are four Impromptus and four Ballades, also four Scherzos. In
                        them the composer is free, fascinating, often bold and daring. The
                        great Fantaisie, Op. 49, is an epic poem, much as the Barcarolle is a
                        poem of love. The two Sonatas, not to mention an early effort in this
                        form, are among the modern classics, which are bound to appear on the
                        programs of every great pianist of the present, and doubtless of
                        the future. The two Concertos are cherished by virtuosi and audience
                        alike, and never fail to make an instant and lasting appeal."

  communication_note: "Cesar Franck won his second prize for fugue composition in 1839. Fugue
                        writing had become so natural and easy for him, that he was able to
                        finish his task in a fraction of the time allotted by the examiners.
                        When he returned home several hours before the other students had
                        finished, his father reproached him roundly for not spending more time
                        on the test upon which so much depended. With his quiet smile the boy
                        answered he thought the result would be all right. And it was! The
                        next year he again secured the first prize for fugue; this was in July
                        1840. The year following he entered the organ contest, which was a
                        surprise to the examiners.
                        Spangler, deeply touched by the boys forlorn case, offered to let
                        him occupy a corner of his garret until he could find work, and Josef
                        gratefully accepted. The boy hoped he could quickly find something to
                        do; but many weary months were spent in looking for employment and
                        in seeking to secure pupils, before there was the slightest sign
                        of success. Thinly clad as he was and with the vigorous appetite of
                        seventeen, which was scarcely ever appeased, he struggled on, hopeful
                        that spring would bring some sort of good cheer."

                        brought to a happy conclusion by Dom Schmitt, and Dom Mocqucreau, the

                        engagement to her, is soon told. During his visit in Dresden, after
                        leaving his parents in Carlsbad, he saw much of his old friends, Count
                        Wodzinski and his family. The daughter, Marie, aged nineteen, was
                        tall and slender, not beautiful but charming, with soft dark hair and
                        soulful eyes. Chopin spent all his evenings at their home and saw much
                        of Marie. The last evening the girl gave him a rose, and he composed a
                        valse for her.
                        On the way to Paris, concerts were given in various cities. In Munich
                        he was acclaimed \x22a second Mozart.\x22 In Strassburg and Stuttgart he had

                        rhythmic invention and combination he is inexhaustible, and as

  communication_note: "In music he learned a great deal from his friend Schalk,[184] a
                        professor at the Vienna Conservatoire; but, like Berlioz, he got most of
                        his education from the libraries, and spent months in reading the scores
                        of the great masters. Not having a piano, he used to carry Beethovens
                        sonatas to the Prater Park in Vienna and study them on a bench in the
                        open air. He soaked himself in the classics--in Bach and Beethoven, and
                        the German masters of the _Lied_--Schubert and Schumann. He was one of
                        the young Germans who was passionately fond of Berlioz; and it is due to
                        Wolf that France was afterwards honoured in the possession of this great
                        artist, whom French critics, whether of the school of Meyerbeer, Wagner,
                        Franck, or Debussy, have never understood. He was also early a friend of
                        old Anton Bruckner, whose music we do not know in France, neither his
                        eight symphonies, nor his _Te Deum_, nor his masses, nor his cantatas,
                        nor anything else of his fertile work. Bruckner had a sweet and modest
                        character, and an endearing, if rather childish, personality. He was
                        rather crushed all his life by the Brahms party; but, like Franck in
                        France, he gathered round him new and original talent to fight the
                        academic art of his time.
                        At Raffs suggestion, MacDowell visited Liszt in the spring of 1882.
                        The dreaded encounter with the master proved to be a delightful
                        surprise, as Liszt treated him with much kindness and courtesy. Eugen
                        DAlbert, who was present, was asked to accompany the orchestral part
                        of the concerto on a second piano. Liszt commended the work in warm
                        terms: \x22You must bestir yourself,\x22 he warned DAlbert, \x22if you do not
                        wish to be outdone by our young American.\x22 Liszt praised his piano
                        playing too, and MacDowell returned to Frankfort in a happy frame of
                        mind.
                        Like the musician that Nietzsche dreamed of,[169] he seems \x22to hear
                        ringing in his ears the prelude of a deeper, stronger music, perhaps a
                        more wayward and mysterious music; a music that is super-German, which,
                        unlike other music, would not die away, nor pale, nor grow dull beside
                        the blue and wanton sea and the clear Mediterranean sky; a music
                        super-European, which would hold its own even by the dark sunsets of the
                        desert; a music whose soul is akin to the palm trees; a music that knows
                        how to live and move among great beasts of prey, beautiful and solitary;
                        a music whose supreme charm is its ignorance of good and evil. Only from
                        time to time perhaps there would flit over it the longing of the sailor
                        for home, golden shadows, and gentle weaknesses; and towards it would
                        come flying from afar the thousand tints of the setting of a moral world
                        that men no longer understood; and to these belated fugitives it would
                        extend its hospitality and sympathy.\x22 But it is always the North, the
                        melancholy of the North, and \x22all the sadness of mankind,\x22 mental
                        anguish, the thought of death, and the tyranny of life, that come and
                        weigh down afresh his spirit hungering for light, and force it into
                        feverish speculation and bitter argument. Perhaps it is better so.
                        It was Leipsic perhaps which felt the power of his genius most
                        conclusively. The since famous Leipsic Conservatory was founded
                        by him, and he was unceasing in his labors to advance art in every
                        direction. He also found time to carry out a long cherished plan to
                        erect, at the threshold of the Thomas School, Leipsic, a monument to
                        the memory of Sebastian Bach."

  communication_note: "This seeking for perfection has been carried on by his successor, M.
                        Camille Chevillard, whose orchestra is even more refined still. One may
                        say, I think, that it is to-day the best in Paris. M. Chevillard is more
                        attracted by pure music than Lamoureux was; and he rightly finds that
                        dramatic music has been occupying too large a place in Parisian
                        concerts. In a letter published by the _Mercure de France_, in January,
                        1903, he reproaches the educators of public taste with having fostered a
                        liking for opera, and with not having awakened a respect for pure music:
                        \x22Any four bars from one of Mozarts quartettes have,\x22 he says, \x22a
                        greater educational value than a showy scene from an opera.\x22 No one in
                        Paris conducts classic works better than he, especially the works that
                        possess clean, plastic beauty; and in Germany itself it would be
                        difficult to find anyone who would give a more delicate interpretation
                        of some of Haendels and Mozarts symphonic works. His orchestra has
                        kept, moreover, the superiority that it had already acquired in its
                        repertory of Wagners works. But M. Chevillard has communicated a warmth
                        and energy of rhythm to it that it did not possess before. His
                        interpretations of Beethoven, even if they are somewhat superficial, are
                        very full of life. Like Lamoureux, he has hardly caught the spirit of
                        French romantic works--of Berlioz, and still less of Franck and his
                        school; and he seems to have but lukewarm sympathy for the more recent

                        romantic composers, especially Schumann, for whom he has a marked
                        liking; and he tried, though without great success, to introduce Liszt
                        and Brahms into France, and was the first among us to attract real
                        attention to Russian music, whose brilliant and delicate colouring he
                        excels in rendering. And, like M. Colonne, he has brought the great
                        German _Kapellmeister_ among us--Weingartner, Nikisch, and Richard
                        Strauss, the last mentioned having directed the first performance in
                        Paris of his symphonic poems, _Zarathustra_, _Don Quixote_, and
                        _Heldenleben_, at the Lamoureux concerts."

  communication_note: "Outside the influence that the School exercises by its teaching, its
                        propaganda by means of concerts and publications is very active. From
                        its foundation up to 1904 it had given two hundred performances in one
                        hundred and thirty provincial towns; more than one hundred and fifty
                        concerts in Paris, of which fifty were of orchestral and choral music,
                        sixty of organ music, and forty of chamber-music. These concerts have
                        been well attended by enthusiastic and appreciative audiences, and have
                        been a school for public taste. One does not look for perfect execution
                        there,[232] but for intelligent interpretations and a thirst for a
                        fuller knowledge of the great works of the past. They have revived
                        Monteverdes _Orfeo_ and his _Incoronazione di Poppea_, which had been
                        forgotten these three centuries; and it was following an interest
                        created by repeated performances of Rameau at the _Schola_[233] that
                        _Dardanus_ was performed at Dijon under M. dIndys direction, _Castor
                        et Pollux_ at Montpellier under M. Charles Bordes direction, and that
                        in 1908 the Opera at Paris gave _Hippolyte et Aricie_. Branches of the
                        _Schola_ have, been started at Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Avignon,
                        Montpellier, Nancy, Epinal, Montlucon, Saint-Chamond, and
                        Saint-Jean-deLuz.[234] A publishing house has been associated with the
                        School at Paris; and from this we get Reviews, such as the _Tribune de
                        Saint-Gervais_; publications of old music, such as the _Anthologie des
                        maitres religieux primitifs des XVe, XVIe, et XVIIe siecles_, edited by
                        Charles Bordes; the _Archives des maitres de lorgue des XVIe, XVIIe, et
                        XVIIIe siecles_, edited by Alexandre Guilmant and Andre Pirro; the
                        _Concerts spirituels de la Schola_, the new editions of _Orfeo_, and the
                        _Incoronazione di Poppea_, edited by M. Vincent dIndy; and publications
                        of modern music, such as the _Collection du chant populaire_, the
                        _Repertoire moderne de musique vocale et dorgue_, and, notably, the
                        _Edition mutuelle_, published by the composers themselves, whose
                        property it is.
                        An orchestral society in Vienna gave Wolfs _Penthesilea_ a trial
                        reading; and it was rehearsed, in disregard of all good taste, amid
                        shouts of laughter. When it was finished, the conductor said:
                        \x22Gentlemen, I ask your pardon for having allowed this piece to be played
                        to the end; but I wanted to know what manner of man it is that dares to

  communication_note: "It was 2 oclock in the morning, Mr. Stokowski, the conductor, was
                        secluded in his drawing room, perhaps asleep, but more likely trying
                        to digest three helpings of creamed oysters in which he had indulged
                        at the home of an effusive Harrisburg hostess. Mr. Stokowski in those
                        days couldnt let creamed oysters alone, but neither could he take
                        them.
                        I have said that Berlioz had a matchless gift for expressing tragic
                        melancholy, weariness of life, and the pangs of death. In a general way,
                        one may say that he was a great elegist in music. Ambros, who was a very
                        discerning and unbiassed critic, said: \x22Berlioz feels with inward
                        delight and profound emotion what no musician, except Beethoven, has
                        felt before.\x22 And Heinrich Heine had a keen perception of Berliozs
                        originality when he called him \x22a colossal nightingale, a lark the size
                        of an eagle.\x22 The simile is not only picturesque, but of remarkable
                        aptness. For Berliozs colossal force is at the service of a forlorn and
                        tender heart; he has nothing of the heroism of Beethoven, or Haendel, or
                        Gluck, or even Schubert. He has all the charm of an Umbrian painter, as
                        is shown in _LEnfance du Christ_, as well as sweetness and inward
                        sadness, the gift of tears, and an elegiac passion.
                        I am not speaking of the general public only, The German public of
                        to-day are devotees of Brahms and Wagner, and everything of theirs seems
                        good to them; they have no discrimination, and, while they applaud
                        Wagner and encore Brahms, they are, in their hearts, not only frivolous,
                        but sentimental and gross. The most striking thing about this public is
                        their cult of power since Wagners death. When listening to the end of
                        _Die Meistersinger_ I felt how the haughty music of the great march
                        reflected the spirit of this military nation of shop-keepers, bursting
                        with rude health and complacent pride.

                        the opposite side. The building is still there and well preserved,
                        although the principal story is used as public dining rooms. A large
                        tablet has been placed above the doorway, with a likeness of the
                        composer encircled by a wreath of laurel. Here little Felix was born,
                        February 3, 1809. There were other children, Fanny a year or two
                        older, then after Felix came Rebekka and little Paul. When French
                        soldiers occupied the town in 1811, life became very unpleasant for
                        the German residents, and whoever could, sought refuge in other cities
                        and towns. Among those who successfully made their escape was the
                        Mendelssohn-Bartholdy family, the second name belonged to the family
                        and was used to distinguish their own from other branches of the
                        Mendelssohn family. With his wife and children, Abraham Mendelssohn
                        fled to Berlin, and made his home for some years with the grandmother,
                        who had a house on the Neue Promenade, a fine broad street, with
                        houses only on one side, the opposite side descended in a grassy slope
                        to the canal, which flowed lazily by."

                        higher. To fuse all the arts in one complete whole was the idea that
                        had been forming in his mind. He first illustrated this in \x22The Flying

                        theory made both vocal and instrumental music secondary to the

                        It needed a complete upheaval of the nation--a political and moral
                        upheaval--to change that frame of mind. Some indication of the change
                        was making itself felt in the last years of the second Empire. Wagner,
                        who suffered from the hostility or indifference of the public in 1860,
                        at the time when _Tannhaeuser_ was performed at the Opera, had already
                        found, however, a few understanding people in Paris who discerned his
                        genius and sincerely admired him. The most interesting of the writers
                        who first began to understand musical emotion is Charles Baudelaire. In
                        1861, Pasdeloup gave the first _Concerts populaires de musique
                        classique_ at the Cirque dHiver. The Berlioz Festival, organised by M.
                        Reyer, on March 23rd, 1870, a year after Berliozs death, revealed to
                        France the grandeur of its greatest musical genius, and was the
                        beginning of a campaign of public reparation to his memory.

  communication_note: "The boy Christoph, like many another lad who became a great musician,
                        had a sorrowful childhood, full of poverty and neglect. His home was
                        in the little town of Weissenwangen, on the borders of Bohemia, where
                        he was born July 2, 1714. As a little lad he early manifested a love
                        for music, but his parents were in very straitened circumstances and
                        could not afford to pay for musical instruction. He was sent to one of
                        the public schools. Fortunately the art of reading music from notes,
                        formation of scales and fundamentals, was taught along with general
                        school subjects."

  communication_note: "The first act of _Siegfried_ is one of the most dramatic in the
                        Tetralogy. Nothing satisfied me more completely at Bayreuth, both as
                        regards the actors and the dramatic effects. Fantastic creatures like
                        Alberich and Mimi, who seem to be out of their element in France, are
                        rooted deep down in German imaginations. The Bayreuth actors surpassed
                        themselves in making them startlingly lifelike, with a trembling and
                        grimacing realism. Burgstaller, who was then making his debut in
                        _Siegfried_, acted with an impetuous awkwardness which accorded well
                        with the part. I remember with what zest--which seemed in no way
                        affected--he played the hero smith, labouring like a true workman,
                        blowing the fire and making the blade glow, dipping it in the steaming
                        water, and working it on the anvil; and then, in a burst of Homeric
                        gaiety, singing that fine hymn at the end of the first act, which sounds
                        like an air by Bach or Haendel.
                        \x22On November 1, there is to be a concert at the Theater Italien. I
                        am asked to write an Overture and am going to take as subject
                        Shakespeares Tempest; it will be quite a new style of thing. My great
                        concert, with the Symphonie Fantastique, will take place November
                        14, but I must have a theatrical success; Camilles parents insist on
                        that, as a condition of our marriage. I hope I shall succeed.\x22

                        I am not speaking of the general public only, The German public of
                        to-day are devotees of Brahms and Wagner, and everything of theirs seems
                        good to them; they have no discrimination, and, while they applaud
                        Wagner and encore Brahms, they are, in their hearts, not only frivolous,
                        but sentimental and gross. The most striking thing about this public is
                        their cult of power since Wagners death. When listening to the end of
                        _Die Meistersinger_ I felt how the haughty music of the great march
                        reflected the spirit of this military nation of shop-keepers, bursting
                        with rude health and complacent pride."

  communication_subject: "The character of the songs is very restrained, and Wolfs genius here approached a classic clearness of form."
  communication_note: "It was for a long time the corner-stone of the edifice of music in
                        Paris. But although it has always numbered in its ranks many illustrious
                        and devoted professors--among whom it recognised, a little late, the
                        founder of the young French school, Cesar Franck--and though the
                        majority of artists who have made a name in French music have received
                        its teaching, and the list of laureates of Rome who have come from its
                        composition classes includes all the heads of the artistic movement
                        to-day in all its diversity, and ranges from M. Massenet to M. Bruneau,
                        and from M. Charpentier to M. Debussy--in spite of all this, it is no
                        secret that, since 1870, the official action with regard to the movement
                        amounts to almost nothing; though we must at least do it justice, and
                        say that it has not hindered it.[211]
                        We must consider a little this singular book, where a living science and
                        a Gothic spirit are closely intermingled (I use the word \x22Gothic\x22 in its
                        best sense; I know it is the highest praise one can give M. dIndy).
                        This work has not received the attention it deserves. It is a record of
                        the spirit of contemporary art; and if it stands rather apart from other
                        writings, it should not be allowed to pass unnoticed on that account."

  communication_subject: "Buchor has had to go to German classical musicians almost entirely, and, generally speaking, his choice has been a happy one."
  communication_note: "He was now twenty-seven years old, and had as yet published nothing. The
                        years of 1887 and 1888 were the most critical ones of his life. In 1887
                        he lost his father whom he loved so much, and that loss, like so many of
                        his other misfortunes, gave fresh impulse to his energies. The same
                        year, a generous friend called Eckstein published his first collection
                        of _Lieder_. Wolf up to that time had been smothered, but this
                        publication stirred the life in him, and was the means of unloosing his
                        genius. Settled at Perchtoldsdorf, near Vienna, in February, 1888, in
                        absolute peace, he wrote in three months fifty-three _Lieder_ to the
                        words of Eduard Moerike, the pastor-poet of Swabia, who died in 1875, and
                        who, misunderstood and laughed at during his lifetime, is now covered
                        with honour, and universally popular in Germany. Wolf composed his
                        songs in a state of exalted joy and almost fright at the sudden
                        discovery of his creative power.
                        Young Palestrina, living his simple, busy life in his home town, never
                        dreamed he was destined to become a great musician. He married in
                        1548, when he was about twenty-two. If he had wished to secure one of
                        the great musical appointments in Rome, it was a very unwise thing for
                        him to marry, for single singers were preferred in nine cases out of
                        ten. Palestrina did not seem to realize this danger to a brilliant
                        career, and took his bride, Lucrezia, for pure love. She seems to have
                        been a person after his own heart, besides having a comfortable dowry
                        of her own. They had a happy union, which lasted for more than thirty
                        years.
                        In this sketchy portrait I must not forget one of the finest of this
                        composers gifts--his talent as a teacher of music. Everything has
                        fitted M. dIndy for this part. By his knowledge and his precise,
                        orderly mind he must be a perfect teacher of composition. If I submit
                        some question of harmony or melodic phrasing to his analysis, the result
                        is the essence of clear, logical reasoning; and if the reasoning is a
                        little dry and simplifies the thing almost too much, it is still very
                        illuminating and from the hand of a master of French prose. And in this
                        I find him exercising the same consistent instinct of good sense and
                        sincerity, the same art of development, the same seventeenth and
                        eighteenth century principles of classic rhetoric that he applies to his
                        music. In truth, M. dIndy could write a musical _Discourse on Style_,
                        if he wished.
                        These are shining qualities. If Berlioz had had Wagners reasoning power
                        and had made the utmost use of his intuitions, if he had had Wagners
                        will and had shaped the inspirations of his genius and welded them into
                        a solid whole, I venture to say that he would have made a revolution in
                        music greater than Wagners own; for Wagner, though stronger and more
                        master of himself, was less original and, at bottom, but the close of a
                        glorious past."

  communication_note: "M. Chevillard had been asked to conduct, not one of the works of our
                        recent masters, like Debussy or Dukas, whose style he renders to
                        perfection, but Francks _Les Beatitudes_, a work whose spirit he does
                        not, to my mind, quite understand. The mystic tenderness of Franck
                        escapes him, and he brings out only what is dramatic. And so that
                        performance of _Les Beatitudes_, though in many respects fine, left an
                        imperfect idea of Francks genius.
                        Genius has a right to be what it will--to trample underfoot, if it
                        wishes, taste and morals and the whole of society. But when those who
                        are not geniuses wish to do the same thing they only make themselves
                        ridiculous and odious. There have been too many monkey Wagners in
                        France. During the last ten or twenty years scarcely one French musician
                        has escaped Wagners influence. One understands only too well the revolt
                        of the French mind, in the name of naturalness and good taste, against
                        exaggerations and extremes of passion, whether sincere or not. _Pelleas
                        et Melisande_ came as a manifestation of this revolt. It is an
                        uncompromising reaction against over-emphasis and excess, and against
                        anything that oversteps the limits of the imagination. This distaste of
                        exaggerated words and sentiments results in what is like a fear of
                        showing the feelings at all, even when they are most deeply stirred.
                        With Debussy the passions almost whisper; and it is by the imperceptible
                        vibrations of the melodic line that the love in the hearts of the
                        unhappy couple is shown, by the timid \x22Oh, why are you going?\x22 at the
                        end of the first act, and the quiet \x22I love you, too,\x22 in the last scene
                        but one. Think of the wild lamentations of the dying Ysolde, and then of
                        the death of Melisande, without cries and without words.
                        [Footnote 66: M. Camille Saint-Saens wrote in his _Portraits et
                        Souvenirs_, 1900: \x22Whoever reads Berliozs scores before hearing them
                        played can have no real idea of their effect. The instruments appear to
                        be arranged in defiance of all common sense; and it would seem, to use
                        professional slang, that _cela ne dut pas sonner_, but _cela sonne_
                        wonderfully. If we find here and there obscurities of style, they do not
                        appear in the orchestra; light streams into it and plays there as in the
                        facets of a diamond.\x22]
                        [Footnote 91: Jacques Passy notes that with Berlioz the most frequent
                        phrases consist of twelve, sixteen, eighteen, or twenty bars. With
                        Wagner, phrases of eight bars are rare, those of four more common, those
                        of two still more so, while those of one bar are most frequent of all

                        the theatre only opened its doors to him with difficulty. It was really
                        splendid!"

                        temperament, and could understand the aims of the composer as no
                        other woman had yet done. This ardent attraction led later to Cosimas

                        Although it did not seem advisable to give concerts in Vienna, yet
                        Chopin made many pleasant acquaintances among the musicians and
                        prominent people, and was constantly invited. He had planned to
                        go from Vienna to either Italy or France. As there were political
                        troubles in the former country, he decided to start for Paris,
                        stopping on the way at a few places. In Munich he gave a morning
                        concert, in the hall of the Philharmonie, which won him renown. From
                        Munich he proceeded to Stuttgart, and during a short stay there, heard
                        the sad news of the taking of Warsaw by the Russians. This event, it
                        is said, inspired him to compose the C minor Etude, Op. 10, No. 12.

                        gradually neglected until he was at last left to shift for himself."

                        3,000 francs to be given to a native composer, chosen by the Minister,
                        to compose a religious work, either a mass or an oratorio, to be

                        With the help of the annuity Grieg was able to give up teaching and
                        conducting and devote himself to composition. He left Christiania,
                        where he and Mme. Grieg had resided for eight years, and came back
                        for a time to Bergen. Here, in January 1874, Ibsen offered him the
                        proposition of writing music for his work, for which he was arranging
                        a stage production.
                        Chopin was preeminently a composer for the piano. With the exception
                        of the Trio, Op. 8 and a book of Polish songs, everything he wrote was
                        for his favorite instrument. There are seventy-one opus numbers in the
                        list, but often whole sets of pieces are contained in one opus number,
                        as is the case with the etudes, of which there are twelve in Op. 10,
                        and the same in Op. 25. These etudes take up every phase of piano
                        technic; each one has a definite aim, yet each is a beautiful finished
                        work as music. They have been edited and re-edited by the greatest
                        masters."

                        There was an institution in Busseto called the Monte di Piete, which
                        gave four scholarships of three hundred francs a year, each given for
                        four years to promising young men needing money to study science or
                        art. Through Barezzi one of these scholarships was given to Verdi, it
                        being arranged that he should have six hundred francs a year for two
                        years, instead of three hundred francs for four years. Barezzi himself
                        advanced the money for the music lessons, board and lodging in Milan
                        and the priest gave him a letter of introduction to his nephew, a
                        professor there, who received him with a hearty welcome, and insisted
                        upon his living with him.
                        Leopold Mozart was distracted at news of this project. He at once
                        wrote, advising his son to go to Paris and try there to make a name
                        and fame for himself. The son dutifully yielded at once. With a heavy
                        heart he prepared to leave Mannheim, where he had spent such a happy
                        winter, and his love dream came to an end. It was a sad parting with
                        the Weber household, for they regarded Wolfgang as their greatest
                        benefactor."

                        breakdown. He was living at the home of his brother Ferdinand, in one
                        of the suburbs of the city. Although he revived a little during
                        the early part of November, so that he could resume walks in the
                        neighborhood, the weakness increased, and eleven days passed without
                        food or drink. Lingering till the nineteenth of November, he passed
                        peacefully away, still in his early manhood. The old father, the
                        schoolmaster at the old home, hoped to have his son buried in the
                        little cemetery near by. But Ferdinand knew his brothers wish, to be
                        placed near Beethoven in Wehringer Cemetery. The monument, erected by
                        his friends and admirers the following year, bears, above the name,
                        this inscription:
                        Early in the year 1872, when our composer was nearly forty, we find
                        him installed in the historic rooms in the third floor of Number 4
                        Carls Gasse, Vienna, which were to remain to the end of his life
                        the nearest approach to an establishment of his own. There were three
                        small rooms. The largest contained his grand piano, writing table, a
                        sofa with another table in front of it. The composer was still
                        smooth of face and looked much as he did at twenty, judging from his
                        pictures. It was not until several years later, about 1880, that
                        he was adorned by the long heavy beard, which gave his face such a
                        venerable appearance."

  communication_note: "But the musical part of _Tristan_ is not free either from the faults of
                        the work as a whole, for it, too, lacks unity. Wagners music is made up
                        of very diverse styles: one finds in it Italianisms and Germanisms and
                        even Gallicisms of every kind; there are some that are sublime, some
                        that are commonplace; and at times one feels the awkwardness of their
                        union and the imperfections of their form. Then again, perhaps two ideas
                        of equal originality come together and spoil each other by making too
                        strong a contrast. The fine lamentation of King Mark--that
                        personification of a knight of the Grail--is treated with such
                        moderation and with so noble a scorn for outward show, that its pure,
                        cold light is entirely lost after the glowing fire of the duet.
                        But at least the _Societe Nationale_ has gloriously achieved the task it
                        set itself. In thirty years it has created in Paris a little centre of
                        earnest composers of symphonies and chamber-music, and a cultured public
                        that seems able to understand them."

  communication_note: "Strauss has directed Wagners dramas at Weimar since 1889. While
                        breathing their atmosphere he turned his attention to the theatre, and
                        wrote the libretto of his opera _Guntram_. Illness interrupted his work,
                        and he was in Egypt when he took it up again. The music of the first act
                        was written between December, 1892, and February, 1893, while travelling
                        between Cairo and Luxor; the second act was finished in June, 1893, in
                        Sicily; and the third act early in September, 1893, in Bavaria. There
                        is, however, no trace of an oriental atmosphere in this music. We find
                        rather the melodies of Italy, the reflection of a mellow light, and a
                        resigned calm. I feel in it the languid mind of the convalescent, almost
                        the heart of a young girl whose tears are ready to flow, though she is
                        smiling a little at her own sad dreams. It seems to me that Strauss must
                        have a secret affection for this work, which owes its inspiration to
                        the undefinable impressions of convalescence. His fever fell asleep in
                        it, and certain passages are full of the caressing touch of nature, and
                        recall Berliozs _Les Troyens_. But too often the music is superficial
                        and conventional, and the tyranny of Wagner makes itself felt--a rare
                        enough occurrence in Strausss other works. The poem is interesting;
                        Strauss has put much of himself into it, and one is conscious of the
                        crisis that unsettled his broad-minded but often self-satisfied and
                        inconsistent ideas.
                        Berlioz is almost the exclusive property of the Chatelet. Not only have
                        they performed his works there more frequently than anywhere else,[218]
                        but they are better understood there than in other places. The Colonne
                        orchestra and its conductor, gifted with great warmth of spirit,--though
                        it is sometimes a little intemperate--are rather bothered by works of a
                        classic nature and by those that show contemplative feeling; but they
                        give wonderful expression to Berliozs tumultuous romanticism, his
                        poetic enthusiasm, and the bright and delicate colouring of his
                        paintings and his musical landscapes. Although Berlioz has his place at
                        the Chevillard and Conservatoire concerts, it is to the Chatelet that
                        his followers flock; and their enthusiasm has not been affected by the
                        campaign that for several years has been directed against Berlioz by
                        some French critics under the influence of the younger musical
                        party--the followers of dIndy and Debussy.
                        On returning to Paris, he had much domestic trouble to bear. His wife
                        was paralyzed and his only son, Louis, wished to leave home and become
                        a sailor--which he did eventually, though much against the wishes of
                        his parents.
                        This seeking for perfection has been carried on by his successor, M.
                        Camille Chevillard, whose orchestra is even more refined still. One may
                        say, I think, that it is to-day the best in Paris. M. Chevillard is more
                        attracted by pure music than Lamoureux was; and he rightly finds that
                        dramatic music has been occupying too large a place in Parisian
                        concerts. In a letter published by the _Mercure de France_, in January,
                        1903, he reproaches the educators of public taste with having fostered a
                        liking for opera, and with not having awakened a respect for pure music:
                        \x22Any four bars from one of Mozarts quartettes have,\x22 he says, \x22a
                        greater educational value than a showy scene from an opera.\x22 No one in
                        Paris conducts classic works better than he, especially the works that
                        possess clean, plastic beauty; and in Germany itself it would be
                        difficult to find anyone who would give a more delicate interpretation
                        of some of Haendels and Mozarts symphonic works. His orchestra has
                        kept, moreover, the superiority that it had already acquired in its
                        repertory of Wagners works. But M. Chevillard has communicated a warmth
                        and energy of rhythm to it that it did not possess before. His
                        interpretations of Beethoven, even if they are somewhat superficial, are
                        very full of life. Like Lamoureux, he has hardly caught the spirit of
                        French romantic works--of Berlioz, and still less of Franck and his
                        school; and he seems to have but lukewarm sympathy for the more recent
                        developments of French music. But he understands well the German
                        romantic composers, especially Schumann, for whom he has a marked
                        liking; and he tried, though without great success, to introduce Liszt
                        and Brahms into France, and was the first among us to attract real
                        attention to Russian music, whose brilliant and delicate colouring he
                        excels in rendering. And, like M. Colonne, he has brought the great
                        German _Kapellmeister_ among us--Weingartner, Nikisch, and Richard
                        Strauss, the last mentioned having directed the first performance in
                        Paris of his symphonic poems, _Zarathustra_, _Don Quixote_, and
                        _Heldenleben_, at the Lamoureux concerts."

                        head. The existence of numerous fine camera studies of the Maestro
                        proves that he doesnt dislike being photographed. Nor does he dislike
                        photographers. But he hates flashlights because they hurt his eyes.
                        M. Chevillard alone represented our French musicians at the festival;
                        and they could have made no better choice of a conductor. But Germany
                        had delegated her two greatest composers, Strauss and Mahler, to come to
                        conduct their newest compositions. And I think it would not have been
                        too much to set up one of our own foremost composers to combat the glory
                        which these two enjoy in their own country.
                        The disasters of the war in 1870 regenerated the nations artistic
                        spirit. Music felt its effect immediately.[207] On February 24th, 1871,
                        the _Societe nationale de Musique_ was instituted to propagate the works
                        of French composers; and in 1873 the _Concerts de lAssociation
                        artistique_ were started under M. Colonnes direction; and these
                        concerts, besides making people acquainted with the classic composers of
                        symphonies and the masters of the young French school, were especially
                        devoted to the honouring of Berlioz, whose triumph reached its summit
                        about 1880.[208]"

                        At last the tide turned slightly. A few pupils attracted by the small
                        fee he charged, took lessons on the clavier; he got a few engagements
                        to play violin at balls and parties, while some budding composers got
                        him to revise their manuscripts for a small fee. All these cheering
                        signs of better times made Josef hopeful and grateful. One day a
                        special piece of good fortune came his way. A man who loved music,
                        at whose house he had sometimes played, sent him a hundred and fifty
                        florins, to be repaid without interest whenever convenient."

                        breaks on the jetty, flooding the scene with a dazzling green light. The
                        crowd recoil in fear. There is a silence; and an old fisherman takes off
                        his woollen cap and intones the _De Profundis_. The villagers take up

                        The orchestra men, too, learned to like him. They discovered that,

                        He is a merciless task master, but in rehearsals he gives himself no
                        airs. Dressed in an old pair of pants and a disreputable brown woolen
                        sweater, which he has worn in private since the day he landed in
                        Boston, he works like a stevedore. When he, the pants and the sweater
                        had been with the Symphony ten years, the men gave him a testimonial

                        This mystical opera was produced in Paris, at the Opera Comique,
                        in April, 1902, and at once made a sensation. It had any number of
                        performances and still continues as one of the high lights of the
                        French stage. Its fame soon reached America, and the first performance
                        was given in New York in 1907, with a notable cast of singing actors,
                        among whom Mary Garden, as the heroine gave an unforgettable, poetic
                        interpretation.
                        As a rule the right hand gives the tempo and tracks down every
                        smallest melody, wherever it may hide in the score. In passages for
                        the strings, the baton indicates the type of bowing the conductor
                        wants from the violins, violas or cellos."

  communication_subject: "On his journey to Italy he travelled from Marseilles to Livourne with Mazzinian conspirators, who were going to take part in the insurrection of Modena and Bologna."
  communication_note: "The political events of 1848 brought him back to Weimar, and he
                        resumed his post of Court Music Director. He now directed his energies
                        toward making Weimar the first musical city of Germany. Greatly
                        admiring Wagners genius, he undertook to perform his works in Weimar,
                        and to spread his name and fame. Indeed it is not too much to say that
                        without Liszts devoted efforts, Wagner would never have attained his
                        vogue and fame. Wagner himself testified to this.
                        His orchestra is not less composite. It is not a compact and serried
                        mass like Wagners Macedonian phalanxes; it is parcelled out and as
                        divided as possible. Each part aims at independence and works as it
                        thinks best, without apparently troubling about the other parts.
                        Sometimes it seems, as it did when reading Berlioz, that the execution
                        must result in incoherence, and weaken the effect. But somehow the
                        result is very satisfying. \x22Now doesnt that sound well?\x22 said Strauss
                        to me with a smile, just after he had finished conducting
                        _Heldenleben_.[180]
                        I have never bothered myself in art with questions of nationality. I
                        have not even concealed my preference for German music; and I consider,
                        even to-day, that Richard Strauss is the foremost musical composer in
                        Europe. Having said this, I am freer to speak of the strange impression
                        that I had at the Strasburg festival--an impression of the change that
                        is coming over music, and the way that French art is silently setting
                        about taking the place of German art."

  communication_note: "From a scenic point of view, _Pelleas et Melisande_ is also quite
                        opposed to the Bayreuth ideal. The vast proportions--almost immoderate
                        proportions--of the Wagnerian drama, its compact structure and the
                        intense concentration of mind which from beginning to end holds these
                        enormous works and their ideology together, and which is often displayed
                        at the expense of the action and even the emotions, are as far removed
                        as they can be from the French love of clear, logical, and temperate
                        action. The little pictures of _Pelleas et Melisande_, small and
                        sharply cut, each marking without stress a new stage in the evolution of
                        the drama, are built up in quite a different way from those of the
                        Wagnerian theatre.
                        There are four Impromptus and four Ballades, also four Scherzos. In
                        them the composer is free, fascinating, often bold and daring. The
                        great Fantaisie, Op. 49, is an epic poem, much as the Barcarolle is a
                        poem of love. The two Sonatas, not to mention an early effort in this
                        form, are among the modern classics, which are bound to appear on the
                        programs of every great pianist of the present, and doubtless of
                        the future. The two Concertos are cherished by virtuosi and audience
                        alike, and never fail to make an instant and lasting appeal.
                        His acquaintance with Porpora promised better things. The singing
                        master had noticed his skill in playing the harpsichord, and offered
                        to engage him as accompanist. Haydn gladly accepted at once, hoping to
                        pick up much musical knowledge in this way. Old Porpora was very
                        harsh and domineering at first, treating him more like a valet than
                        a musician. But at last he was won over by Haydns gentleness and
                        patience, until he was willing to answer all his questions and
                        to correct his compositions. Best of all he brought Haydn to the
                        attention of the nobleman in whose house he was teaching, so that
                        when the nobleman and his family went to the baths of Mannersdorf for
                        several months, Haydn was asked to go along as accompanist to Porpora.
                        The achievement of an artistic ideal so restricted as this would not
                        have sufficed, however, to assure the success of the _Schola Cantorum_,
                        nor establish its authority with a public that was, whatever people may
                        say, only lukewarm in its religion, and that would only interest itself
                        in the religious art of other days as it would in a passing fashion. But
                        the spirit of curiosity and the meaning of modern life began to weigh
                        little by little with the Scholas principles. After singing
                        Palestrinian and Gregorian chants at the Church of Saint-Gervais during
                        Holy Week, they played Carissimi, Schuetz, and the Italian and German
                        masters of the seventeenth century. Then came Bachs cantatas; and their
                        performance, given by M. Bordes in the Salle dHarcourt, attracted large
                        audiences and started the cult of this master in Paris. Then they sang
                        Rameau and Gluck; and, finally, all ancient music, sacred or secular,
                        was approved. And so this little school, which had been consecrated to
                        the cult of ancient religious music, and had made so modest a
                        beginning,[229] developed into a School of Art capable of satisfying
                        modern wants; and in 1900, when M. Vincent dIndy became president of
                        the _Schola_, it was decided to move the school into larger premises in
                        the Rue Saint-Jacques."

                        older and modern masters. With other musicians at Court much chamber
                        music was played, in fact almost the entire repertoire. The young
                        musician soon became a favorite at Court, not only on account of his
                        musical genius but also because of the general culture of his mind.

                        Brahms loved the great masters! How he played Haydn and Mozart! With
                        what beauty of interpretation and delicate shading of tone. And then

                        composition and playing it in _any_ key, without a mistake. His score
                        reading was marvelous. Bach, Handel, Mozart, Haydn, all seemed to flow
                        naturally from under his fingers."

  communication_note: "The first of the Wagner Festivals under patronage of the King, took
                        place in Munich June 10, 13, 19, and July 1, 1865. The work was
                        \x22Tristan and Isolde,\x22 perhaps the finest flower of Wagners genius,
                        and already eight years old. Von Below was a superb conductor and
                        Ludwig an inspired Tristan. Wagner was supremely happy. Alas, such
                        happiness did not last. Enemies sprang up all about him. The King
                        himself could not stem the tide of false rumors, and besought the
                        composer to leave Munich for a while, till public opinion calmed
                        down. So Wagner returned to his favorite Switzerland and settled
                        in Triebschen, near Lucerne, where he remained till he removed to
                        Bayreuth in 1872.
                        [Footnote 131: \x22I like Liszts music so much, because he does not bother
                        about other peoples opinions; he says what he wants to say; and the
                        only thing that he troubles about is to say it as well as he possibly
                        can\x22 (Quoted by Hippeau).]
                        And I shall not dwell on Berliozs love of Nature, which, as M.
                        Prudhomme shows us, is the soul of a composition like the _Damnation_
                        and, one might say, of all great compositions. No musician, with the
                        exception of Beethoven, has loved Nature so profoundly. Wagner himself
                        did not realise the intensity of emotion which she roused in
                        Berlioz,[73] and how this feeling impregnated the music of the
                        _Damnation_, of _Romeo_, and of _Les Troyens_.
                        Bach began to realize that the Cethen post, while it gave him plenty
                        of leisure for his work, did not give him the scope he needed for his
                        art. The Prince had lately married, and did not seem to care as much
                        for music as before."

  communication_note: "The cause of the artistic success of _Pelleas et Melisande_ is of a more
                        specially French character, and marks a reaction that is at once
                        legitimate, natural, and inevitable; I would even say it is vital--a
                        reaction of French genius against foreign art, and especially against
                        Wagnerian art and its awkward representatives in France.
                        In speaking of the moral reasons of the success of _Pelleas et
                        Melisande_, I would like to draw your attention to a form of thought
                        which is not confined to France, but which is common nowadays in a
                        section of the more distinguished members of European society, and which
                        has found expression in _Pelleas et Melisande_. The atmosphere in which
                        Maeterlincks drama moves makes one feel the melancholy resignation of
                        the will to Fate. We are shown that nothing can change the order of
                        events; that, despite our proud illusions, we are not master of
                        ourselves, but the servant of unknown and irresistible forces, which
                        direct the whole tragicomedy of our lives. We are told that no man is
                        responsible for what he likes and what he loves--that is if he knows
                        what he likes and loves--and that he lives and dies without knowing why."

  communication_note: "With the home atmosphere he enjoyed, the boy Grieg early became
                        familiar with names of the great composers and their works. One of
                        his idols was Chopin, whose strangely beautiful harmonies were just
                        beginning to be heard, though not yet appreciated. His music must have
                        had an influence over the lads own efforts, for he always remained
                        true to this ideal.
                        On June 18, 1821, came the first performance of Webers masterpiece,
                        \x22Der Freischetz.\x22 The theater was beseiged for hours by eager crowds,
                        and when the doors were at last opened, there was a grand rush to
                        enter. The whole house from pit to galleries was soon filled, and
                        when the composer entered the orchestra, there was a roar of applause,
                        which it seemed would never end. As the performance proceeded, the
                        listeners became more charmed and carried away, and at the close there
                        was a wild scene of excitement. The success had been tremendous, and
                        the frequent repetitions demanded soon filled the treasury of the
                        theater. Everybody was happy, the composer most of all. The melodies
                        were played on every piano in Germany and whistled by every street
                        urchin. Its fame spread like lightning over Europe, and quickly
                        reached England. In London the whole atmosphere seemed to vibrate with
                        its melodies. In Paris, however, it did not please on first hearing,
                        perhaps because it was so thoroughly German. But somewhat later, when
                        renamed \x22Robin des Bois,\x22--\x22Robin of the Forest,\x22--it was performed
                        some three hundred and fifty times before being withdrawn.
                        Nothing is truer. The _Societe Nationale_ is indeed a guest-chamber,
                        where for the past thirty years a guest-chamber art and guest-chamber
                        opinions have been formed; and from it some of the profoundest and most
                        poetic French music has been derived, such as Francks and Debussys
                        chamber-music. But its atmosphere is becoming daily more rarefied. That
                        is a danger. It is to be feared that this art and thought may be
                        absorbed by the decadent subtleties or pedantic scholasticism which is
                        apt to accompany all coteries--in short, that its music will be
                        salon-music rather than chamber-music. Even the Society itself seems to
                        have felt this at times; and at different periods has sought contact
                        with the general public, and put itself into direct communication with
                        it. \x22It becomes more and more necessary,\x22 wrote M. Saint-Saens, \x22that
                        French composers should find something intermediate between an intimate
                        hearing of their music and a performance of it before the general
                        public--something which would not be a speculative thing like a big
                        concert, but which would be analogous to the artistic attraction of an
                        exhibition of painting, and which would dare everything. It is a new aim
                        for the _Societe Nationale_.\x22 But it does not seem that it has yet
                        attained this goal, nor that it is near attaining it, despite some not
                        quite happy attempts."

                        on God and my Euryanthe.\x22 The opera was produced at the Kernthnertor
                        Theater, in Vienna, on October 25, 1823. The composer, though weak and
                        ill, made the long journey to the great city, that he might personally
                        introduce his favorite to the Viennese. He wrote his wife after the
                        performance: \x22Thank God, as I do, beloved wife, for the glorious
                        success of Euryanthe. Weary as I am, I must still say a sweet good
                        night to my beloved Lina, and cry Victory! All the company seemed in
                        a state of ecstasy; singers, chorus, orchestra;--all were drunk, as it
                        were, with joy.\x22

                        hear this poem of a youthful soul at a concert. It is then that the
                        magic murmurs of the forest in the second act speak more directly to the
                        heart. However beautiful the scenery of glades and woods, however
                        cleverly the light is made to change and dance among the trees--and it
                        is manipulated now like a set of organ stops--it still seems almost
                        wrong to listen with open eyes to music that, unaided, can show us a
                        glorious summers day, and make us see the swaying of the tree-tops, and
                        hear the brush of the wind against the leaves. Through the music alone
                        the hum and murmur of a thousand little voices is about us, the glorious
                        song of the birds floats into the depths of a blue sky; or comes a
                        silence, vibrating with invisible life, when Nature, with her mysterious
                        smile, opens her arms and hushes all things in a divine sleep.
                        The following year he returned to Moscow and seemed quite his natural
                        self. A fever of energy for work took possession of him. He began a
                        new opera, \x22Eugen Onegin,\x22 and completed his Fourth Symphony, in F
                        minor. The score of the opera was finished in February, 1878, and
                        sent at once to Moscow, where the first performance was given in March
                        1879. In the beginning the opera had only a moderate success, but
                        gradually grew in favor till, after five years, it was performed
                        in St. Petersburg and had an excellent reception. It is considered
                        Tschaikowskys most successful opera, sharing with Glinkas \x22Life of
                        the Tsar\x22 the popularity of Russian opera. In 1881 he was invited
                        to compose an orchestral work for the consecration of the Temple of
                        Christ in Moscow. The \x22Solemn Overture 1812,\x22 Op. 49, was the outcome
                        of this. Later in the year he completed the Second Piano Concerto.
                        The Piano Trio in A minor, \x22To the memory of a great artist,\x22 Op.

  communication_note: "The third act takes place in the prison of the chateau; and it is a
                        surprising, uncertain, and very curious act. It is not a logical result
                        of the action that has preceded it. One feels a sudden commotion in the
                        poets ideas, a crisis of feeling which disturbed him even as he wrote,
                        and a difficulty which he did not succeed in solving. The new light
                        towards which he was beginning to move appears very clearly. Strauss was
                        too advanced in the composition of his work to escape the neo-Christian
                        renouncement which had to finish the drama; he could only have avoided
                        that by completely remodelling his characters. So Guntram rejects
                        Freihilds love. He sees he has fallen, even as the others, under the
                        curse of sin. He had preached charity to others when he himself was full
                        of egoism; he had killed Robert rather to satisfy his instinctive and
                        animal jealousy than to deliver the people from a tyrant. So he
                        renounces his desires, and expiates the sin of being alive by retirement
                        from the world. But the interest of the act does not lie in this
                        anticipated _denouement_, which since _Parsifal_ has become rather
                        common; it lies in another scene, which has evidently been inserted at
                        the last moment, and which is uncomfortably out of tune with the action,
                        though in a singularly grand way. This scene gives us a dialogue between
                        Guntram and his former companion, Friedhold.[172]
                        The new opera \x22Radamisto\x22 was ready early in 1720, and produced at the
                        Royal Academy of Music, as the theater was now called. The success
                        of the production was tremendous. But Handel, by his self-will had
                        stirred up envy and jealousy, and an opposition party was formed,
                        headed by his old enemy from Hamburg, Buononcini, who had come to
                        London to try his fortunes. A test opera was planned, of which Handel
                        wrote the third act, Buononcini the second and a third musician the
                        first. When the new work was performed, the third act was pronounced
                        by the judges much superior to the second. But Buononcinis friends
                        would not accept defeat, and the battle between all parties was
                        violent. Newspapers were full of it, and many verses were written.
                        Handel cared not a whit for all this tempest, but calmly went his way.
                        The Shakespeare of the realm of music, as he has been called, first
                        saw the light on December 16, 1770, in the little University town
                        of Bonn, on the Rhine. His father, Johann Beethoven, belonged to the
                        court band of the Elector of Cologne. The family were extremely poor.
                        The little room, where the future great master was born, was so low,
                        that a good-sized man could barely stand upright in it. Very small
                        it was too, and not very light either, as it was at the back of the
                        building and looked out on a walled garden.
                        Franz Liszt, in his day the king of pianists, a composer whose
                        compositions still glow and burn with the fire he breathed into them;
                        Liszt the diplomat, courtier, man of the world--always a conqueror!
                        How difficult to tell, in a few pages, the story of a life so complex
                        and absorbing!"

  communication_note: "Berliozs other great originality lay in his talent for music that was
                        suited to the spirit of the common people, recently raised to
                        sovereignty, and the young democracy. In spite of his aristocratic
                        disdain, his soul was with the masses. M. Hippeau applies to him Taines
                        definition of a romantic artist: \x22the plebeian of a new race, richly
                        gifted, and filled with aspirations, who, having attained for the first
                        time the worlds heights, noisily displays the ferment of his mind and
                        heart.\x22 Berlioz grew up in the midst of revolutions and stories of
                        Imperial achievement. He wrote his cantata for the _Prix de Rome_ in
                        July, 1830, \x22to the hard, dull noise of stray bullets, which whizzed
                        above the roofs, and came to flatten themselves against the wall near
                        his window.\x22[93] When he had finished this cantata, he went, \x22pistol in
                        hand, to play the blackguard in Paris with the _sainte canaille_.\x22 He
                        sang the _Marseillaise_, and made \x22all who had a voice and heart and
                        blood in their veins\x22[94] sing it too. On his journey to Italy he
                        travelled from Marseilles to Livourne with Mazzinian conspirators, who
                        were going to take part in the insurrection of Modena and Bologna.
                        Whether he was conscious of it or not, he was the musician of
                        revolutions; his sympathies were with the people."

                        of Chandos, and was expected to live at the princely mansion he
                        inhabited. The size and magnificence of The Cannons was the talk of
                        the country for miles around. Here the composer lived and worked,
                        played the organ in the chapel, composed church music for the service
                        and wrote his first English oratorio, \x22Esther.\x22 This was performed in
                        the Dukes chapel, and the Duke on this occasion handed the composer
                        five thousand dollars. Numerous compositions for the harpsichord
                        belong to this period, among them the air and variations known as
                        \x22The Harmonious Blacksmith.\x22 The story goes that Handel was walking
                        to Cannons through the village of Edgeware, and being overtaken by a
                        heavy shower, sought shelter in the smithy. The blacksmith was singing
                        at his work and his hammer kept time with his song. The composer was
                        struck with the air and its accompaniment, and as soon as he reached
                        home, wrote out the tune with the variations. This story has been
                        disputed, and it is not known whether it is true or not.

                        In 1853, Louis Niedermeyer founded in Paris an _Ecole de musique
                        religieuse et classique_, which strove \x22to form singers, organists,
                        choir-masters, and composers of music, by the study of the classic works
                        of the great masters of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth
                        centuries.\x22 This school, subsidised by the State, was a nursery for
                        some real musicians. It reckoned among its pupils some noted composers,
                        conductors, organists, and historians; among others, M. Gabriel Faure,
                        M. Andre Messager, M. Eugene Gigout, and M. Henry Expert. M. Saint-Saens
                        was a professor there, and became its president. Nearly five hundred
                        organists, choir-masters, and professors of music of the Conservatoire
                        and other French colleges were trained there. But this school, serious
                        in intention, and a refuge for the classic spirit in the midst of the
                        prevailing bad taste, did not trouble itself about influencing the
                        public, and, in fact, almost ignored it."

                        resist the temptation of having it copied (which will mean an
                        expense of a thousand or twelve hundred francs), and then of having
                        it played. I shall give a concert, and the receipts will barely
                        cover half the cost. I shall lose what I have not got; the poor

  communication_note: "Well, here is that music; you will nowhere find a more perfect model. It
                        is true that many who profess the principles of this music repudiate
                        the model, and do not hide their disdain for Berlioz. That makes me
                        doubt a little, I admit, the results of their efforts. If they do not
                        feel the wonderful freedom of Berliozs music, and do not see that it
                        was the delicate veil of a very living spirit, then I think there will
                        be more of archaism than real life in their pretensions to \x22free music.\x22
                        Study, not only the most celebrated pages of his work, such as the
                        _Scene damour_ (the one of all his compositions that Berlioz himself
                        liked best),[85] _La Tristesse de Romeo_, or _La Fete des Capulet_
                        (where a spirit like Wagners own unlooses and subdues again tempests of
                        passion and joy), but take less well-known pages, such as the
                        _Scherzetto chante de la reine Mab_, or the _Reveil de Juliette_, and
                        the music describing the death of the two lovers.[86] In the one what
                        light grace there is, in the other what vibrating passion, and in both
                        of them what freedom and apt expression of ideas. The language is
                        magnificent, of wonderful clearness and simplicity; not a word too much,
                        and not a word that does not reveal an unerring pen. In nearly all the
                        big works of Berlioz before 1845 (that is up to the _Damnation_) you
                        will find this nervous precision and sweeping liberty.
                        Since 1875 he had been writing music: _Lieder_, sonatas, symphonies,
                        quartets, etc., and already his _Lieder_ held the most important place.
                        He also composed in 1883 a symphonic poem on the _Penthesilea_ of his
                        friend Kleist."

  communication_note: "Thus music had almost come back to its own, as far as the higher kind of
                        teaching and the intellectual world were concerned. It remained for a
                        place to be found for it in other kinds of teaching; for there, and
                        especially in secondary education, its advance was less sure. It
                        remained for us to make it enter into the life of the nation and into
                        the peoples education. This was a difficult task, for in France art has
                        always had an aristocratic character; and it was a task in which neither
                        the State nor musicians were very interested. The Republic still
                        continued to regard music as something outside the people. There had
                        even been opposition shown during the last thirty years towards any
                        attempt at popular musical education. In the old days of the Pasdeloup
                        concerts one could pay seventy-five centimes for the cheapest places,
                        and have a seat for that; but at some of the symphony concerts to-day
                        the cheapest seats are two and four francs. And so the people that
                        sometimes came to the Pasdeloup concerts never come at all to the big
                        concerts to-day.
                        The _Academie des Beaux-Arts_, where six chairs are reserved for the
                        musical section, could have played a very important part in the musical
                        organisation of France by the authority of its name, and by the many
                        prizes that it gives for composition and criticism, especially by the
                        _Prix de Rome_, which it awards every year. But it does not play its
                        part well, partly because of the antiquated statutes that govern it, by
                        which a handful of musicians are associated with a great number of
                        painters, sculptors, and architects, who are ignorant of music and mock
                        at the musicians, as they did in the time of Berlioz; and partly because
                        it is the custom of the Academy that the little group of musicians shall
                        be trained in a very conservative way. One of the names of these
                        musicians is justly celebrated--that of M. Saint-Saens; but there are
                        others whose fame is of poorer quality, and others still who have no
                        fame at all. And the whole forms a little group, which though it does
                        not put any actual obstacles in the way of the progress of art, yet does
                        not look upon it favourably, but remains rather apart in an indifferent
                        or even hostile spirit.
                        Handels industry in composing for the Royal Academy of Music
                        was untiring. For the first eight years from the beginning of the
                        Societys work he had composed and produced fourteen operas. During
                        all this time, his enemies never ceased their efforts to destroy him.
                        The great expense of operatic production, the troubles and quarrels
                        with singers, at last brought the Academy to the end of its resources.
                        At this juncture, the famous \x22Beggars Opera,\x22 by John Gay, was
                        brought out at a rival theater. It was a collection of most beautiful
                        melodies from various sources, used with words quite unworthy of them.
                        But the fickle public hailed the piece with delight, and its success
                        was the means of bringing total failure to the Royal Academy. Handel,
                        however, in spite of the schemes of his enemies, was determined to
                        carry on the work with his own fortune. He went again to Italy to
                        engage new singers, stopping at Halle to see his mother who was ill.
                        She passed away the next year at the age of eighty."

                        carried with it free rooms and living, and he was lodged at the Hotel
                        Stadt Frankfort, a comfortable inn, exactly opposite the Castle, and
                        thus close to the scene of his new labors.
                        A storm outside: but all was warmth and simple comfort in the large
                        sitting-room of a stewards cottage belonging to the small estate of
                        Raiding, in Hungary.
                        Shortly after his return home he was saddened by the loss of his
                        good, kind, patient mother, and a few months later his little sister
                        Margaretha passed away. No doubt these sorrows were expressed in some
                        of his most beautiful compositions. But brighter days followed the
                        dark ones. He became acquainted with the Breuning family, a widow
                        lady and four children, three boys and a girl, all young people. The
                        youngest boy and the girl became his pupils, and all were very fond
                        of him. He would stay at their house for days at a time and was always
                        treated as one of the family. They were cultured people, and in
                        their society Beethovens whole nature expanded. He began to take an
                        interest in the literature of his own country and in English authors
                        as well. All his spare time was given to reading and composition.
                        A valuable acquaintance with the young Count Von Waldstein was made
                        about this time. The Count called one day and found the composer at
                        his old worn out piano, surrounded by signs of abject poverty. It
                        went to his heart to see that the young man, whose music he so greatly
                        admired should have to struggle for the bare necessities of life while
                        he himself enjoyed every luxury. It seemed to him terribly unjust. He
                        feared to offend the composers self-respect by sending him money, but
                        shortly after the call Beethoven was made happy by the gift of a fine
                        new piano, in place of his old one. He was very grateful for this
                        friendship and later dedicated to the Count one of his finest sonatas,
                        the Op. 53, known as the \x22Waldstein Sonata.\x22"

                        began to consider new works. Its orchestra, composed of eminent
                        instrumentalists, enjoys a classical fame; though it is now no longer
                        alone in the excellence of its performances, and has perhaps lost a
                        little the secret that it claimed to possess for the interpretation of
                        great classical works. It excels in works of a neo-classic character,
                        like those of M. Saint-Saens, which are stronger in style and taste than
                        in life and passion. The Conservatoire concerts have also a relative
                        superiority over other concerts in Paris in the performance of choral
                        works, which up to the present have been very second-rate. But these
                        concerts are not easy of access for the general public, as the number of
                        seats for sale is very limited. And so the society is representative of
                        a little public whose taste is, broadly speaking, conservative and
                        official; and the noise of the strife outside its doors only reaches its
                        ears slowly, and with a deadened sound.
                        Not enough attention has been drawn to the classical nobility from which
                        Berliozs art so spontaneously springs. It is not fully acknowledged
                        that he was, of all nineteenth-century musicians, the one who had in the
                        highest degree the sense of plastic beauty. Nor do people always
                        recognise that he was a writer of sweet and flowing melodies.
                        Weingartner expressed the surprise he felt when, imbued with current
                        prejudice against Berliozs lack of melodic invention, he opened, by
                        chance, the score of the overture of _Benvenuto_ and found in that short
                        composition, which barely takes ten minutes to play, not one or two, but
                        four or five melodies of admirable richness and originality:--
                        The work of the early period shows Debussy developing freely and
                        naturally. The independence of his thinking is unmistakable, but it
                        does not run into wilfulness. There is no violent break with the past,
                        but simply the quickening of certain French qualities by the infusion
                        of a new personality. It seemed as if a new and charming miniaturist
                        had appeared, who was doing both for piano and song what had never
                        been done before. The style of the two Arabesques and the more
                        successful of the Ariettes oubliees is perfect. A liberator seemed to
                        have come into music, to take up, half a century later, the work of
                        Chopin--the work of redeeming the art from the excessive objectivity
                        of German thought, of giving it not only a new soul but a new body,
                        swift, lithe and graceful. And that this exquisitely clear, pellucid
                        style could be made to carry out not only gaiety and whimsicality but
                        emotion of a deeper sort, is proved by the lovely \x22Clair de Lune.\x22
                        He went to Dresden, and at first looked over the situation. On nearer
                        view the prospect was not as bright as it had appeared at first. There
                        was a rival faction, strongly opposed to his plans for the promotion
                        of German opera. There had never been anything tolerated at Dresden
                        but Italian opera, and there were many talented Italian singers to
                        interpret them. Weber was encouraged by a new national spirit, which
                        he felt would favor German opera, and was determined to conquer at
                        all costs. He finally succeeded, for, as he wrote to a friend, \x22The
                        Italians have moved heaven, earth and hell also, to swallow up the
                        whole German opera and its promoter. But they have found in me a
                        precious tough morsel; I am not easily swallowed.\x22 It was the same
                        kind of fight that Handel waged in England, and that Gluck fought
                        against the Piccinists."

  communication_note: "Schubert added many compositions to his list this year, among them
                        seventeen songs, including \x22Gretchen at the Spinning Wheel.\x22 His
                        acquaintance with the poet Johann Mayrhofer, with whom he soon became
                        intimate, was of benefit to both. The poet produced verses that
                        his friend might set to music. The following year, 1815, he wrote a
                        hundred and thirty-seven songs, to say nothing of six operas, and much
                        music for church and piano. Twenty-nine of these songs were written
                        in the month of August. One day in August eight songs were created; on
                        another day seven. Some of the songs were quite long, making between
                        twenty and thirty pages when printed.
                        The Lamoureux Concerts have not had as stable a dwelling-place as the
                        Chatelet Concerts. They have wandered about Paris from one room to
                        another--from the Cirque dHiver to the Cirque dEte, and from the
                        Chateau-dEau to the Nouveau Theatre. At the present moment they are in
                        the Salle Gaveau, which is much too small for them. In spite of the
                        progress of music and musical taste, Paris has not yet a concert-hall,
                        as the smallest provincial towns in Germany have; and this shameful
                        indifference, unworthy of the artistic renown of Paris, obliges the
                        symphonic societies to take refuge in circuses or theatres, which they
                        share with other kinds of performers, though the acoustics of these
                        places are not intended for concerts. And so it happens that for six
                        years the Chevillard Concerts have been given at the back of a
                        music-hall, which has the same entrance, and which is only separated
                        from the concert-room by a small passage, so that the roaring choruses
                        of a _danse du venire_ may mingle with an adagio of Beethovens or a
                        scene from the Tetralogy. Worse than this, the smallness of the place
                        into which these concerts have been crammed has been a serious obstacle
                        in the way of making them popular. Nevertheless, in the promenade and
                        galleries of the Nouveau Theatre, in later years, arose what may be
                        called a little war over concertos. It was rather a curious episode in
                        the history of the musical taste of Paris, and merits a few words here.
                        In every country, but especially in those countries that are least
                        musical, a virtuoso profits by public favour, often to the detriment of
                        the work he is performing; for what is most liked in music is the
                        musician. The virtuoso--whose importance must not be underrated, and who
                        is worthy of honour when he is a reverential and sympathetic interpreter
                        of genius--has too often taken a lamentable part, especially in Latin
                        countries, in the degrading of musical taste; for empty virtuosity makes
                        a desert of art. The fashion of inept fantasias and acrobatic
                        variations has, it is true, gone by; but of late years virtuosity has
                        returned in an offensive way, and, sheltering itself under the solemn
                        classical name of \x22concertos,\x22 it usurped a place of rather exaggerated
                        importance in symphony concerts, and especially in M. Chevillards
                        concerts--a place which Lamoureux would never have given it. Then the
                        younger and more enthusiastic part of the public began to revolt; and
                        very soon, with perfect impartiality and quite indiscriminately, began
                        to hiss famous and obscure virtuosi alike in their performance of any
                        concerto, whether it was splendid or detestable. Nothing found favour
                        with them--neither the playing of Paderewski, nor the music of
                        Saint-Saens and the great masters. The management of the concerts went
                        its own way and tried in vain to put out the disturbers, and to forbid
                        them entry to the concert-room; and the battle went on for a long time,
                        and critics were drawn into it. But in spite of its ridiculous excesses,
                        and the barbarism of the methods by which the parterre expressed its
                        opinions, that quarrel is not without interest. It proved how a passion
                        and enthusiasm for music had been roused in France; and the passion,
                        though unjust in its expression, was more fruitful and of far greater
                        worth than indifference."

  communication_note: "Nothing could have better completed the musical education of the public
                        than this continuous defile, for the past ten years, of _Kapellmeister_
                        and foreign virtuosi, and the comparisons that their different styles
                        and interpretations afforded. Nothing has better helped forward the
                        improvement of Parisian orchestras than the emulation brought about by
                        the meetings between Parisian conductors and those of other countries.
                        At present our own conductors are worthy rivals of the best in Germany.
                        The string instruments are good; the wood has kept its old French
                        superiority; and though the brass is still the weakest part of our
                        orchestras, it has made great progress. One may still criticise the
                        grouping of orchestras at concerts, for it is often defective; there is
                        a disproportion between the different families of instruments and, in
                        consequence, between their different sonorities, some of which are too
                        thin and others too dull. But these defects are fairly common all over
                        Europe to-day. Unhappily, more peculiar to France is the insufficiency
                        or poor quality of the choirs, whose progress has been far from keeping
                        pace with that of the orchestras. It is to this side of music that the
                        directors of concerts must now bring their efforts to bear.
                        In 1869, the Khedive of Egypt had a fine opera house built in Cairo,
                        and commissioned Verdi to write an opera having an Egyptian subject,
                        for the opening. The ever popular \x22Aida\x22 was then composed and brought
                        out in 1871, with great success. This proved to be the beginning of
                        the masters third period, for he turned from his earlier style which
                        was purely lyric, to one with far more richness of orchestration.
                        Tschaikowsky wrote six Symphonies in all. The Second, in C minor
                        was composed in 1873; in this he used themes in the first and last
                        movements, which were gathered in Little Russia. The work was produced
                        with great success in Moscow in 1873. The next orchestral composition
                        was a Symphonic Poem, called \x22The Tempest,\x22 with a regular program,
                        prepared by Stassow. It was brought out in Paris at the same time
                        it was heard in Moscow. Both at home and in France it made a deep
                        impression. The next work was the splendid piano Concerto in B flat
                        minor, Op. 23, the first of three works of this kind. At a trial
                        performance of it, his friend and former master, Nicholas Rubinstein,
                        to whom it was dedicated, and who had promised to play the piano part,
                        began to criticize it unmercifully and ended by saying it was quite
                        unplayable, and unsuited to the piano."

                        longing to compose a religious work on the Sermon on the Mount. In
                        1869, he set to work on the poem, and when that was well under way,
                        began to create, with great ardor, the musical setting.
                        Then a pupil of Francks, M. Henry Expert, who began his admirable works
                        on Musical History in 1882, laid the foundation of the _Societe J.S.
                        Bach_, in order to spread the knowledge of ancient music written between
                        the twelfth and eighteenth centuries. And he succeeded in interesting
                        in his undertaking, not only the principal French musicians, such as
                        Cesar Franck, Saint-Saens, and Gounod, but also foreigners, such as Hans
                        von Buelow, Tschaikowsky, Grieg, Sgambati, and Gevaert. Unhappily this
                        society never got farther than arranging what it wanted to do, and only
                        sketched out the plans that were realised later by Charles Bordes.

                        son. For days and weeks he remained at home, neglecting his piano and
                        his work. He again thought of the church with renewed ardor and told
                        his mother he now had decided to become a monk. His spirits sank very
                        low; he became ill, unable to leave the house and it was reported
                        everywhere he had passed away.
                        In less than six months the boy was able to solve the most difficult
                        problems in counterpoint. He learned to know Mozarts music, and tried
                        to write with more simplicity of style. A piano sonata, a polonaise
                        for four hands and a fantaisie for piano belong to this year. After
                        that he aspired to make piano arrangements of great works, such as
                        Beethovens \x22Ninth Symphony.\x22 Then came his own symphony, which
                        was really performed at Gewandhaus, and is said to have shown great
                        musical vigor."

                        kept a strict watch on all his movements, and this became irksome to
                        the boy, who felt he was already a man.
                        _Heldenleben_ would be in every way one of the masterpieces of musical
                        composition if a literary error had not suddenly cut short the soaring
                        flight of its most impassioned pages, at the supreme point of interest
                        in the movement, in order to follow the programme; though, besides this,
                        a certain coldness, perhaps weariness, creeps in towards the end. The
                        victorious hero perceives that he has conquered in vain: the baseness
                        and stupidity of men have remained unaltered. He stifles his anger, and
                        scornfully accepts the situation. Then he seeks refuge in the peace of
                        Nature. The creative force within him flows out in imaginative works;
                        and here Richard Strauss, with a daring warranted only by his genius,
                        represents these works by reminiscences of his own compositions, and
                        _Don Juan, Macbeth, Tod und Verklaerung, Till, Zarathustra, Don Quixote,
                        Guntram_, and even his _Lieder_, associate themselves with the hero
                        whose story he is telling. At times a storm will remind this hero of his
                        combats; but he also remembers his moments of love and happiness, and
                        his soul is quieted. Then the music unfolds itself serenely, and rises
                        with calm strength to the closing chord of triumph, which is placed like
                        a crown of glory on the heros head."

  communication_note: "In music he learned a great deal from his friend Schalk,[184] a
                        professor at the Vienna Conservatoire; but, like Berlioz, he got most of
                        his education from the libraries, and spent months in reading the scores
                        of the great masters. Not having a piano, he used to carry Beethovens
                        sonatas to the Prater Park in Vienna and study them on a bench in the
                        open air. He soaked himself in the classics--in Bach and Beethoven, and
                        the German masters of the _Lied_--Schubert and Schumann. He was one of
                        the young Germans who was passionately fond of Berlioz; and it is due to
                        Wolf that France was afterwards honoured in the possession of this great
                        artist, whom French critics, whether of the school of Meyerbeer, Wagner,
                        Franck, or Debussy, have never understood. He was also early a friend of
                        old Anton Bruckner, whose music we do not know in France, neither his
                        eight symphonies, nor his _Te Deum_, nor his masses, nor his cantatas,
                        nor anything else of his fertile work. Bruckner had a sweet and modest
                        character, and an endearing, if rather childish, personality. He was
                        rather crushed all his life by the Brahms party; but, like Franck in
                        France, he gathered round him new and original talent to fight the
                        academic art of his time.
                        That is the first pitfall; but there are many more that will beset us in
                        the attempt to understand Berlioz. To get at the man himself one must
                        break down a wall of prejudice and pedantry, of convention and
                        intellectual snobbery. In short, one must shake off nearly all current
                        ideas about his work if one wishes to extricate it from the dust that
                        has drifted about it for half a century."

  communication_note: "What would the piano playing world do without the music of Frederic
                        Chopin? We can hardly think of the piano without thinking of Chopin,
                        since he wrote almost exclusively for the universal instrument. His
                        music touches the heart always rather than the head, the emotional
                        message far outweighs the intellectual meaning. It is vital
                        music--love music, winning the heart by its tenderness, voicing the
                        highest sentiments by its refinement, its purity, its perfection of
                        detail and finish.
                        \x22I began to laugh, both with pleasure at having discovered such a
                        treasure, and with annoyance at finding how narrow human judgment is.
                        Here I counted five themes, all of them plastic and expressive of
                        personality; of admirable workmanship, varied in form, working up by
                        degrees to a climax, and then finishing with strong effect. And this
                        from a composer who was said by critics and the public to be devoid of
                        creative power! From that day on there has been for me another great
                        citizen in the republic of art.\x22[74]
                        But this may be the result of growing older; and if I do not recognise
                        the Wagner of other days, it is perhaps because I do not recognise my
                        former self. A work of art, and above all a work of musical art, changes
                        with ourselves. _Siegfried_, for example, is for me no longer full of
                        mystery. The qualities in it that strike me to-day are its cheerful
                        vigour, its clearness of form, its virile force and freedom, and the
                        extraordinary healthiness of the hero, and, indeed, of the whole work."

                        power, he began at once with reforms. Finding that Palestrina and two
                        other singers were married men, he put all three out, though granting

                        dimmed its brilliancy. One would like to end with _Siegfried_, and
                        escape the gloomy _Goetterdaemmerung_. For those who have sensitive
                        feelings the fourth day of the Tetralogy has a depressing effect. I
                        remember the tears I have seen shed at the end of the _Ring_, and the
                        words of a friend, as we left the theatre at Bayreuth and descended the
                        hill at night: \x22I feel as though I were coming away from the burial of
                        someone I dearly loved.\x22 It was truly a time of mourning. Perhaps there
                        was something incongruous in building such a structure when it had
                        universal death for its conclusion--or at least in making the whole an
                        object of show and instruction. _Tristan_ achieves the same end with
                        much more power, as the action is swifter. Besides that, the end of
                        _Tristan_ is not without comfort, for life there is terrible. But it is
                        not the same in _Goetterdaemmerung_; for in spite of the absurdity of the
                        spell which is set upon the love of Siegfried and Bruennhilde, life with
                        them is happy and desirable, since they are beings capable of love, and
                        death appears to be a splendid but awful catastrophe. And one cannot say
                        the _Ring_ breathes a spirit of renunciation and sacrifice like
                        _Parsifal_; renunciation and sacrifice are only talked about in the
                        _Ring_; and, in spite of the last transports which impel Bruennhilde to
                        the funeral pyre, they are neither an inspiration nor a delight. One has
                        the impression of a great gulf yawning at ones feet, and the anguish of
                        seeing those one loves fall into it.
                        For the next few years there were many \x22ups and downs\x22 in Carls life.
                        From Breslau he went to Carlsruhe, and entered the service of Prince
                        Eugene. For about a year he was a brilliant figure at the Court. Then
                        war clouds gathered and the gay Court life came to an end. Music
                        under the present conditions could no longer support him, as the whole
                        social state of Germany had altered. The young composer was forced to
                        earn his livelihood in some way, and now became private secretary to
                        Prince Ludwig of Wurtemburg, whose Court was held at Stuttgart. The
                        gay, dissolute life at the Court was full of temptation for our young
                        composer, yet he found considerable time for composition; his opera
                        \x22Sylvana\x22 was the result, besides several smaller things. During the
                        Stuttgart period, his finances became so low, that on one occasion he
                        had to spend several days in prison for debt. Determined to recruit
                        his fortunes, he began traveling to other towns to make known his art.
                        In Mannheim, Darmstadt and Baden, he gave concerts, bringing out
                        in each place some of his newer pieces, and earning enough at each
                        concert to last a few weeks, when another concert would keep the wolf
                        from the door a little longer."

  communication_note: "The Mendelssohn family originally lived in Hamburg. Their house faced
                        one of the fine squares of the city, with a handsome church on
                        the opposite side. The building is still there and well preserved,
                        although the principal story is used as public dining rooms. A large
                        tablet has been placed above the doorway, with a likeness of the
                        composer encircled by a wreath of laurel. Here little Felix was born,
                        February 3, 1809. There were other children, Fanny a year or two
                        older, then after Felix came Rebekka and little Paul. When French
                        soldiers occupied the town in 1811, life became very unpleasant for
                        the German residents, and whoever could, sought refuge in other cities
                        and towns. Among those who successfully made their escape was the
                        Mendelssohn-Bartholdy family, the second name belonged to the family
                        and was used to distinguish their own from other branches of the
                        Mendelssohn family. With his wife and children, Abraham Mendelssohn
                        fled to Berlin, and made his home for some years with the grandmother,
                        who had a house on the Neue Promenade, a fine broad street, with
                        houses only on one side, the opposite side descended in a grassy slope
                        to the canal, which flowed lazily by."

                        musical than France, should recognise the grandeur and originality of
                        Berliozs music before France, it is doubtful whether the German nature
                        could ever fully understand a soul so French in its essence. It is,
                        perhaps, what is exterior in Berlioz, his positive originality, that the
                        Germans appreciate. They prefer the _Requiem_ to _Romeo_. A Richard
                        Strauss would be attracted by an almost insignificant work like the
                        _Ouverture du roi Lear_; a Weingartner would single out for notice
                        works like the _Symphonic fantastique_ and _Harold_, and exaggerate
                        their importance. But they do not feel what is intimate in him. Wagner
                        said over the tomb of Weber, \x22England does you justice, France admires
                        you, but only Germany loves you; you are of her own being, a glorious
                        day of her life, a warm drop of her blood, a part of her heart....\x22 One
                        might adapt his words to Berlioz; it is as difficult for a German really
                        to love Berlioz as it is for a Frenchman to love Wagner or Weber. One
                        must, therefore, be careful about accepting unreservedly the judgment of
                        Germany on Berlioz; for in that would lie the danger of a new
                        misunderstanding. You see how both the followers and opponents of
                        Berlioz hinder us from getting at the truth. Let us dismiss them.
                        The boy Franz Liszt had now demonstrated that already at eleven years
                        old, he was one of the leading virtuosi of the time; indeed his great
                        reputation as a pianist dates from this third Vienna concert. The
                        press praised him highly, and many compared him to the wonderful
                        genius, Mozart. Adam Liszt wished him now to see more of the world,
                        and make known his great talents, also to study further. He decided
                        to take the boy to Paris, for there lived the celebrated composer,
                        Cherubini, at that time Director of the Paris Conservatoire."

  communication_note: "The young musician had plenty of work to do, more than most boys
                        of thirteen. For, besides the concerts he had to give, he was set
                        difficult problems by the various professors who wished to test his
                        powers. The fame of his playing constantly spread, so the further he
                        traveled into Italy there were more demands to hear him. At Roveredo,
                        where it was announced he would play the organ in St. Thomass Church,
                        the crowd was so great he could scarcely get to the organ-loft. The
                        vast audience listened spellbound, and then refused to disperse till
                        they had caught a glimpse of the boy player. At Verona he had another
                        triumph; one of his symphonies was performed, and his portrait was
                        ordered to be painted.
                        The prelude to Johanns artistic life was successfully completed. Then
                        came a period of quiet study and inward growth. A deeper activity was
                        to succeed. It opened early in the year 1859, when the young musician
                        traveled to Hanover and Leipsic, bringing out his Concerto in D minor.
                        He performed it in the first named city, while Joachim conducted the
                        orchestra. It was said the work \x22with all its serious striving,
                        its rejection of the trivial, its skilled instrumentation, seemed
                        difficult to understand; but the pianist was considered not merely a
                        virtuoso but a great artist of piano playing.\x22
                        _Menschen waren wir ja auch,
                        Froh und traurig, so wie Ihr.
                        Und nun sind wir leblos hier,
                        Sind nur Erde, wie Ihr sehet_.[191]
                        Johannes was at this time deeply engaged on his piano Sonata in F
                        minor, Op. 5. He had already written two other piano sonatas, as yet
                        little known. The Op. 5, is now constantly heard in concert rooms,
                        played by the greatest artists of our time."

  communication_note: "In the second act, the princes celebrate their victory in the Dukes
                        castle. After some pompous talk on the part of the official
                        _Minnesaenger_, Guntram is invited to sing. Discouraged beforehand by the
                        wickedness of his audience, and feeling that he can sing to no purpose,
                        he hesitates and is on the point of leaving them. But Freihilds sadness
                        holds him back, and for her sake he sings. His song is at first calm and
                        measured, and expresses the melancholy that fills him in the midst of a
                        feast which celebrates triumphant power. He then loses himself in
                        dreams, and sees the gentle figure of Peace moving among the company. He
                        describes her lovingly and with youthful tenderness, which approaches
                        ecstasy as he draws a picture of the ideal life of humanity made free.
                        Then he paints War and Death, and the disorder and darkness that they
                        spread over the world. He addresses himself directly to the Prince; he
                        shows him his duty, and how the love of his people would be his
                        recompense; he threatens him with the hate of the unhappy who are driven
                        to despair; and, finally, he urges the nobles to rebuild the towns, to
                        liberate their prisoners, and to come to the aid of their subjects. His
                        song is ended amid the profound emotion of his audience. Duke Robert,
                        feeling the danger of these outspoken words, orders his men to seize the
                        singer; but the vassals side with Guntram. At this juncture news is
                        brought that the peasants have renewed the attack. Robert calls his men
                        to arms, but Guntram, who feels that he will be supported by those
                        around him, orders Roberts arrest. The Duke draws his sword, but
                        Guntram kills him. Then a sudden change comes over Guntrams spirit,
                        which is explained in the third act. In the scene that follows he speaks
                        no word, his sword falls from his hand, and he lets his enemies again
                        assume their authority over the crowd; he allows himself to be bound and
                        taken to prison, while the band of nobles noisily disperses to fight
                        against the rebels. But Freihild is full of an unaffected and almost
                        savage joy at her deliverance by Guntrams sword. Love for Guntram fills
                        her heart, and her one desire is to save him.
                        Wolf got a little respite from his miseries by going to stay a few weeks
                        in his own country with his brother-in-law, Strasser, an inspector of
                        taxes.[186] He took with him his books, his poets, and began to set them
                        to music.

                        whom I had long been intimate, proposed to introduce me to Debussy;
                        but the rumors I had heard about the composers preferred seclusion
                        always made me refuse in spite of my great desire to know him. I
                        now had a desire to express the feelings awakened in me, and
                        to communicate to others, by means of articles and lectures, my
                        admiration for, and my belief in, the composer and his work. The
                        result was that one day, in 1906, Debussy let me know through
                        a friend, that he would like to see me. From that day began our
                        friendship.\x22

                        the priest repeated the call. Still the child, who was listening to
                        the music, did not hear. \x22Water,\x22 said the priest a third time and
                        gave Giuseppe such a sharp kick that he fell down the steps of the
                        altar, hitting his head on the stone floor, and was taken unconscious
                        into the sacristy."

                        musicians until the _Association des Chanteurs de Saint-Gervais_ was
                        founded in 1892 by Charles Bordes, the choirmaster of the church of
                        Saint-Gervais. The immediate success and the noisy renown of the Society
                        were due to other things besides the talent of its conductor, who
                        combined with a lively artistic intelligence both common-sense and
                        energy and a remarkable gift for organisation--it was due partly to the
                        help of favourable circumstances, partly to the surfeit of Wagnerism, of
                        which I have just spoken, and partly to the birth of a new religious
                        art, which had sprung up since the death of Cesar Franck round the
                        memory of that great musician.
                        Bach began to realize that the Cethen post, while it gave him plenty
                        of leisure for his work, did not give him the scope he needed for his
                        art. The Prince had lately married, and did not seem to care as much
                        for music as before.
                        [Footnote 237: The name, _La Trompette_, was also the pretext for
                        embellishing chamber-music, by introducing the trumpet among the other
                        instruments. To this end M. Saint-Saens wrote his fine septette for
                        piano, trumpet, two violins, viola, violoncello, and double bass; and M.
                        Vincent dIndy his romantic suite in D for trumpet, two flutes, and
                        string instruments.]"

  communication_note: "The musical weakness of that time was a very curious thing, and has
                        given many people the impression that France has never been a musical
                        nation. Historically speaking, nothing could be more wrong. Certainly
                        there are races more gifted in music than others; but often the seeming
                        differences of race are really the differences of time; and a nation
                        appears great or little in its art according to what period of its
                        history we consider. England was a musical nation until the Revolution
                        of 1688; France was the greatest musical nation in the sixteenth
                        century; and the recent publications of M. Henry Expert have given us a
                        glimpse of the originality and perfection of the Franco-Belgian art
                        during the Renaissance. But without going back as far as that, we find
                        that Paris was a very musical town at the time of the Restoration, at
                        the time of the first performance of Beethovens symphonies at the
                        Conservatoire, and the first great works of Berlioz, and the Italian
                        Opera. In Berliozs _Memoires_ you can read about the enthusiasm, the
                        tears, and the feeling, that the performances of Glucks and Spontinis
                        operas aroused; and in the same book one sees clearly that this musical
                        warmth lasted until 1840, after which it died down little by little, and
                        was succeeded by complete musical apathy in the second Empire--an apathy
                        from which Berlioz suffered cruelly, so that one may even say he died
                        crushed by the indifference of the public. At this time Meyerbeer was
                        reigning at the Opera. This incredible weakening of musical feeling in
                        France, from 1840 to 1870, is nowhere better shown than in its romantic
                        and realistic writers, for whom music was an hermetically sealed door.
                        All these artists were \x22_visuels_,\x22 for whom music was only a noise.
                        Hugo is supposed to have said that Germanys inferiority was measured by
                        its superiority in music.[204] \x22The elder Dumas detested,\x22 Berlioz says,
                        \x22even bad music.\x22[205] The journal of the Goncourts calmly reflects the
                        almost universal scorn of literary men for music. In a conversation
                        which took place in 1862 between Goncourt and Theophile Gautier,
                        Goncourt said:
                        The political revolution of 1848, was the cause of many refugees
                        crowding into Hamburg on their way to America. One of these was the
                        violinist, Edward Remenyi, a German Hungarian Jew, whose real name
                        was Hofmann. But it seemed Remenyi was really in no haste to leave
                        Hamburg. Johannes, engaged as accompanist at the house of a wealthy
                        patron, met the violinist and was fascinated by his rendering of
                        national Hungarian music. Remenyi, on his side, saw the advantage of
                        having such an accompanist for his own use. So it happened the two
                        played together frequently for a time, until the violinist disappeared
                        from Germany, for several years. He reappeared in Hamburg at the close
                        of the year 1852. He was then twenty-two, while Brahms was nineteen.
                        It was suggested that the two musicians should do a little concert
                        work together. They began to plan out the trip which became quite
                        a tour by the time they had included all the places they wished to
                        visit."

                        Nicholas Rubinstein. His life was of the simplest, his fare always so.
                        Later on when money was more abundant, and he had his own house in the
                        country, he lived with just the same simplicity. One would think that
                        all this care and thought for expense would have taught him the value
                        of money. Not at all. He never could seem to learn its value, never
                        cared for it, and never could keep it. He liked to toss his small
                        change among groups of street boys, and it is said he once spent his
                        last roubles in sending a cablegram to von Below in America, to thank
                        him for his admirable performance of his first Piano Concerto. Often
                        his friends protested against this prodigality, but it was no use to
                        protest, and at last they gave up in despair.
                        Thus the poem of the Tetralogy was written with doubts, as he said, as
                        to whether he should abandon art and all belonging to it and become a
                        healthy, normal man--a son of nature. He began to compose the music of
                        the poem while in a state of suffering, which every day became more
                        acute.
                        Berlioz, who was welcomed with many humorous and friendly jests on his
                        appearance among the other students, had just settled down to work,
                        when he learned that his Ariel--otherwise Marie Moke--had forsaken him
                        and had married Pleyel. In a wild state of frenzy he would go to Paris
                        at once and seek revenge. He started, got as far as Nice, grew calmer,
                        remained at Nice for a month, during which time the Overture to \x22King
                        Lear\x22 was written, then returned to Rome by the way of Genoa and
                        Florence."

                        a favorable time, as his friends there assured him of a warm
                        welcome. The pleasure he felt on reaching London was increased by the
                        enthusiastic greeting he received at the hands of the musical public.
                        He first appeared at a Philharmonic concert on May 25, when his
                        Symphony in C minor was played. The next day he wrote to Fanny: \x22The
                        success of the concert last night was beyond all I had ever dreamed.
                        It began with my Symphony. I was led to the desk and received an
                        immense applause. The Adagio was encored, but I went on; the Scherzo
                        was so vigorously applauded that I had to repeat it. After the Finale
                        there was lots more applause, while I was thanking the orchestra and
                        shaking hands, till I left the room.\x22
                        The growing success of \x22Armide\x22 only added fuel to the flame of
                        controversy which had been stirred up. To cap the climax, Piccini
                        had finished his opera, which was duly brought out and met with a
                        brilliant reception. Indeed its success was greater than that won by
                        \x22Armide,\x22 much to the delight of the Piccinists. Of course the natural
                        outcome was that the other party should do something to surpass the
                        work of their rivals. Marie Antoinette was besought to prevail on
                        Gluck to write another opera."

  communication_note: "One morning, early in the year 1837, Liszt called on his brother
                        artist and found him in good spirits over some new compositions. He
                        wished to play them to some friends, so it was arranged that a party
                        of them should come to his rooms that evening. Liszt came with his
                        special friend, Mme. dAgoult and George Sand. Afterwards these
                        meetings were frequently repeated. Liszt poetically describes one such
                        evening, in his \x22Life of Chopin.\x22
                        What Tolstoys raillery is really aimed at is not Wagners work, but the
                        way in which his work was represented. The splendours of the setting do
                        not hide the childishness of the ideas behind them: the dragon Fafna,
                        Frickas rams, the bear, the serpent, and all the Valhalla menagerie
                        have always been ridiculous. I will only add that the dragons failure
                        to be terrifying was not Wagners fault, for he never attempted to
                        depict a terrifying dragon. He gave it quite clearly, and of his own
                        choice, a comic character. Both the text and the music make Fafner a
                        sort of ogre, a simple creature, but, above all, a grotesque one."

                        the rules of composition. The first of these efforts, a set of little
                        dances, were written during his seventh or eighth year. It was soon
                        discovered that he could improvise on the piano; indeed he could
                        sketch the disposition of his companions by certain figures on the
                        piano, so exactly and comically that every one burst out laughing
                        at the portraits. He was fond of reading too, much to his fathers
                        delight, and early tried his hand at authorship. He wrote robber
                        plays, which he staged with the aid of the family and such of his
                        youthful friends as were qualified. The father now began to hope
                        his favorite son would become an author or poet; but later Roberts
                        increasing love for music put this hope to flight.

                        1896, in the Salle Pleyel, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of his
                        _debut_, which he made in 1846. It was in this same Salle Pleyel that he
                        gave his first concert.]

                        He had to be very careful, gave fewer lessons during the season, and
                        spent his vacations at Nohant. He played rarely in public, though
                        there were two public concerts in 1841 and 42 at Pleyels rooms. From
                        1843 to 1847 he lived quietly and his life was apparently happy. He
                        was fond of the Sand children, and amused himself with them when at
                        Nohant.

                        equals. Bach, Schubert, Chopin, Schumann, Wagner and Liszt. In
                        rhythmic invention and combination he is inexhaustible, and as

                        which has its source in a rather bitter feeling of the futility of
                        life;[129] and this is accompanied by fits of weariness which are not
                        altogether healthy, followed by capricious moods and nervous gaiety, and
                        a freakish liking for burlesque and mimicry. It is his eager, restless
                        spirit that makes him rush about the world writing Breton and Auvergnian
                        rhapsodies, Persian songs, Algerian suites, Portuguese barcarolles,
                        Danish, Russian, or Arabian caprices, souvenirs of Italy, African
                        fantasias, and Egyptian concertos; and, in the same way, he roams
                        through the ages, writing Greek tragedies, dance music of the sixteenth
                        and seventeenth centuries, and preludes and fugues of the eighteenth.
                        But in all these exotic and archaic reflections of times and countries
                        through which his fancy wanders, one recognises the gay, intelligent
                        countenance of a Frenchman on his travels, who idly follows his
                        inclinations, and does not trouble to enter very deeply into the spirit
                        of the people he meets, but gleans all he can, and then reproduces it
                        with a French complexion--after the manner of Montaigne in Italy, who
                        compared Verona to Poitiers, and Padua to Bordeaux, and who, when he was
                        in Florence, paid much less attention to Michelangelo than to \x22a very
                        strangely shaped sheep, and an animal the size of a large mastiff,
                        shaped like a cat and striped with black and white, which they called a
                        tiger.\x22
                        The next day, Good Friday, the Miserere was performed for the second
                        time. Wolfgang, the boy of fourteen, who had performed the wonderful
                        feat of writing this work out after one hearing, again attended the
                        service, keeping the score in his hat, and found his work was nearly
                        perfect, needing but a couple of trifling corrections.
                        \x22Berliozs harmonies, in spite of the diversity of their effect,
                        obtained from very scanty material, are distinguished by a sort of
                        simplicity, and even by a solidity and conciseness, which one only
                        meets with in Beethoven.... One may find here and there harmonies
                        that are commonplace and trivial, and others that are incorrect--at
                        least according to the old rules. In some places his harmonies have
                        a fine effect, and in others their result is vague and
                        indeterminate, or it sounds badly, or is too elaborate and
                        far-fetched. Yet with Berlioz all this somehow takes on a certain
                        distinction. If one attempted to correct it, or even slightly to
                        modify it--for a skilled musician it would be childs play--the
                        music would become dull\x22 (Article on the _Symphonie fantastique_)."

  communication_note: "The fame of young Mozart, who was acclaimed everywhere as a marvelous
                        prodigy, had naturally reached the fathers ears. He decided to train
                        the little Ludwig as a pianist, so that he should also be hailed as
                        a prodigy and win fame and best of all money for the poverty-stricken
                        family. So the tiny child was made to practice scales and finger
                        exercises for hours together. He was a musically gifted child, but how
                        he hated those everlasting tasks of finger technic, when he longed to
                        join his little companions, who could run and play in the sunshine. If
                        he stopped his practice to rest and dream a bit, the stern face of his
                        father would appear at the doorway, and a harsh voice would call out,
                        \x22Ludwig! what are you doing? Go on with your exercises at once. There
                        will be no soup for you till they are finished.\x22

  communication_note: "Surrounded by refined, cultivated people, in an atmosphere at once
                        moral and intellectual, little Frederic passed a fortunate childhood.
                        He soon manifested such fondness for music, especially for the piano,
                        that his parents allowed him to have lessons, his teacher being
                        Adalbert Zywny, the best-known master of the city. It is related that
                        Zywny only taught his little pupil first principles, for the childs
                        progress was so extraordinary that before long he had mastered all
                        his teacher could impart, and at twelve he was left to shape his own
                        musical destiny.
                        The friend took him to a little place in the Village. The moment Mr.
                        Toscanini entered, the proprietor dashed forward, bowed almost to the
                        ground and said: \x22Maestro, I am greatly honored ... Ill never forget
                        this hour ...\x22 Then he led the party to the most conspicuous spot in
                        the room.
                        No; it was the director of the _Schola Cantorum_, addressing the
                        students in an inaugural speech, or giving them a lecture on
                        Composition.[140]
                        More baneful even than the influence of the theatre is the influence of
                        success. These musicians have nowadays too many facilities for having
                        their music played. A work is played almost before it is finished, and
                        the musician has no time to live with his work in solitude and silence.
                        Besides this, the works of the chief German musicians are supported by
                        tremendous booming of some kind or another: by their _Musikfeste_, by
                        their critics, their press, and their \x22Musical Guides\x22 (_Musikfuehrer_),
                        which are apologetic explanations of their works, scattered abroad in
                        millions to set the fashion for the sheep-like public. And with all this
                        a musician grows soon contented with himself, and comes to believe any
                        favourable opinion about his work. What a difference from Beethoven,
                        who, all his life, was hammering out the same subjects, and putting his
                        melodies on the anvil twenty times before they reached their final form.
                        That is where Mahler is so lacking. His subjects are a rather vulgarised
                        edition of some of Beethovens ideas in their unfinished state. But
                        Mahler gets no further than the rough sketch."

  communication_note: "Franz had soon made such progress on the violin, that he began to take
                        the first violin parts and when the conductor was absent he was asked
                        to lead the orchestra. Indeed by his deep earnestness and sincerity,
                        as well as ability, the gifted boy had become a power in the school.
                        When he went home to see his people, which could only be on Sundays
                        and holidays, it was a happy reunion for all. If he brought home a
                        new string quartet, the father would get out his cello, Ignaz and
                        Ferdinand would take first and second violins and the young composer
                        the viola. After it had been played through, then all the players
                        discussed it and offered their criticism. Indeed Franz was composing
                        at such an astonishing rate, that it was difficult to keep him
                        supplied with music paper. One of his works of this time was a
                        fantasia for four hands, in twelve movements. Then came a first
                        attempt at song writing, a long affair which also contained twelve
                        movements, and was in melancholy mood.
                        After the childrens Album came the music to Byrons \x22Manfred.\x22 This
                        consists of an overture and fifteen numbers. The whole work, with one
                        exception, is deep in thought and masterly in conception. The
                        overture especially is one of his finest productions, surpassing other
                        orchestral works in intellectual grandeur.
                        Of course his nature is too dignified to let the quarrel be shown
                        openly. His heart obeys the commands of his reason, or compromises with
                        it, and by seeming respectful of authority saves appearances. His
                        reason, represented here by the poet, likes simple, realistic, and
                        relevant action, together with moral or even religious teaching. His
                        heart, represented by the musician, is romantic; and if he followed it
                        altogether he would wander off to any subject that enabled him to
                        indulge in his love of the picturesque, such as the descriptive
                        symphony, or even the old form of opera."

  communication_note: "When he was six years old piano lessons began. Mme. Grieg proved a
                        strict teacher, who did not allow any trifling; the dreamy child found
                        he could not idle away his time. As he wrote later: \x22Only too soon it
                        became clear to me I had to practise just what was unpleasant. Had I
                        not inherited my mothers irrepressible energy as well as her musical
                        capacity, I should never have succeeded in passing from dreams to
                        deeds.\x22
                        Beethoven began his lessons with Haydn, but they did not seem to get
                        on well together. The pupil thought the master did not give him enough
                        time and attention. When Haydn went to England, about a year after the
                        lessons began, Beethoven studied with several of the best musicians
                        of the city, both in playing and composition. Albrechtsberger, one of
                        these, was a famous contrapuntist of his time, and the student gained
                        much from his teaching. The young musician was irresistible when he
                        seated himself at the piano to extemporize. \x22His improvisating was
                        most brilliant and striking,\x22 wrote Carl Czerny, a pupil of Beethoven.
                        \x22In whatever company he might be, he knew how to produce such an
                        effect upon the listeners that frequently all eyes would be wet,
                        and some listeners would sob; there was something wonderful in his
                        expressive style, the beauty and originality of his ideas and his
                        spirited way of playing.\x22 Strange to say the emotion he roused in
                        his hearers seemed to find no response in Beethoven himself. He would
                        sometimes laugh at it, at other times he would resent it, saying, \x22We
                        artists dont want tears, we want applause.\x22 These expressions however
                        only concealed his inner feelings--for he was very sympathetic
                        with those friends he loved. His anger, though sharp, was of short
                        duration, but his suspicions of those whose confidence he had won by
                        his genius and force of character, were the cause of much suffering to
                        himself and others.
                        \x22It was thus,\x22 he says,[68] \x22that I began to get familiar with the
                        use of the orchestra, and to know its expression and timbre, as
                        well as the range and mechanism of most of the instruments. By
                        carefully comparing the effect produced with the means used to
                        produce it, I learned the hidden bond which unites musical
                        expression to the special art of instrumentation; but no one put me
                        in the way of this. The study of the methods of the three modern
                        masters, Beethoven, Weber, and Spontini, the impartial examination
                        of the traditions of instrumentation and of little-used forms and
                        combinations, conversations with virtuosi, and the effects I made
                        them try on their different instruments, together with a little
                        instinct, did the rest for me.\x22[69]"

                        childhood. At the Kreuzschule, where his education began, he developed
                        an ardent love for the Greek classics, and translated the first twelve
                        books of the Odyssey, outside of school hours. He devoured all stories
                        of mythology he could lay hands on, and soon began to create vast
                        tragedies. He revelled in Shakespeare, and finally began to write
                        a play which was to combine the ideas of both Hamlet and King Lear.
                        Forty-two persons were killed off in the course of the play and had
                        to be brought back as ghosts, as otherwise there would have been no
                        characters for the last act. He worked on this play for two years.

                        were the result. These did not trouble him in the least, for he
                        merely rubbed his hand over the offending blot and proceeded with his

                        escape the gloomy _Goetterdaemmerung_. For those who have sensitive
                        feelings the fourth day of the Tetralogy has a depressing effect. I
                        remember the tears I have seen shed at the end of the _Ring_, and the
                        words of a friend, as we left the theatre at Bayreuth and descended the
                        hill at night: \x22I feel as though I were coming away from the burial of
                        someone I dearly loved.\x22 It was truly a time of mourning. Perhaps there
                        was something incongruous in building such a structure when it had
                        universal death for its conclusion--or at least in making the whole an
                        object of show and instruction. _Tristan_ achieves the same end with
                        much more power, as the action is swifter. Besides that, the end of
                        _Tristan_ is not without comfort, for life there is terrible. But it is
                        not the same in _Goetterdaemmerung_; for in spite of the absurdity of the
                        spell which is set upon the love of Siegfried and Bruennhilde, life with
                        them is happy and desirable, since they are beings capable of love, and
                        death appears to be a splendid but awful catastrophe. And one cannot say
                        the _Ring_ breathes a spirit of renunciation and sacrifice like
                        _Parsifal_; renunciation and sacrifice are only talked about in the
                        _Ring_; and, in spite of the last transports which impel Bruennhilde to
                        the funeral pyre, they are neither an inspiration nor a delight. One has
                        the impression of a great gulf yawning at ones feet, and the anguish of
                        seeing those one loves fall into it.
                        While this movement was going on in the artistic world, scholars were
                        taking their share in it, and music was beginning to invade the
                        University."

  communication_subject: "The wonderful Sixth Symphony, Op."
  communication_note: "And this is how the work of Richard Strauss appears to me up to the
                        present. Guntram kills Duke Robert, and immediately lets fall his sword.
                        The frenzied laugh of Zarathustra ends in an avowal of discouraged
                        impotence. The delirious passion of Don Juan dies away in nothingness.
                        Don Quixote when dying forswears his illusions. Even the Hero himself
                        admits the futility of his work, and seeks oblivion in an indifferent
                        Nature. Nietzsche, speaking of the artists of our time, laughs at \x22those
                        Tantaluses of the will, rebels and enemies of laws, who come, broken in
                        spirit, and fall at the foot of the cross of Christ.\x22 Whether it is for
                        the sake of the Cross or Nothingness, these heroes renounce their
                        victories in disgust and despair, or with a resignation that is sadder
                        still. It was not thus that Beethoven overcame his sorrows. Sad adagios
                        make their lament in the middle of his symphonies, but a note of joy and
                        triumph is always sounded at the end. His work is the triumph of a
                        conquered hero; that of Strauss is the defeat of a conquering hero. This
                        irresoluteness of the will can be still more clearly seen in
                        contemporary German literature, and in particular in the author of _Die
                        versunkene Glocke_. But it is more striking in Strauss, because he is
                        more heroic. And so we get all this display of superhuman will, and the
                        end is only \x22My desire is gone!\x22
                        It is said of Palestrina that he became the \x22savior of church music,\x22
                        at a time when it had almost been decided to banish all music from the
                        service except the chant, because so many secular subjects had been
                        set to music and used in church. Things had come to a very difficult
                        pass, until at last the fathers turned to Palestrina, desiring him
                        to compose a mass in which sacred words should be heard throughout.
                        Palestrina, deeply realizing his responsibility, wrote not only one
                        but three, which, on being heard, pleased greatly by their piety,
                        meekness, and beautiful spirit. Feeling more sure of himself,
                        Palestrina continued to compose masses, until he had created
                        ninety-three in all. He also wrote many motets on the Song of Solomon,
                        his Stabat Mater, which was edited two hundred and fifty years later
                        by Richard Wagner, and his lamentations, which were composed at the
                        request of Sixtus V.
                        Inspired by these studies he tried his hand at music making in
                        earnest. First came some arrangements of trios and quartettes. Then
                        finally he was emboldened to write a quintette for flute, two violins,
                        viola and cello. Two months later he had produced another quintette,
                        which proved to be a little better. At this time Hector was twelve
                        and a half. His father had set his heart on the boys following his
                        footsteps and becoming a doctor; the time was rapidly approaching when
                        a decision had to be made. Doctor Berlioz promised if his son would
                        study anatomy and thoroughly prepare himself in this branch of the
                        profession, he should have the finest flute that could be bought. His
                        cousin Robert shared these anatomical lessons; but as Robert was a
                        good violinist, the two boys spent more time over music than over
                        osteology. The cousin, however, really worked over his anatomy, and
                        was always ready at the lessons with his demonstrations, while Hector
                        was not, and thus drew upon himself many a reprimand. However he
                        managed to learn all his father could teach him, and when he was
                        nineteen consented to go to Paris, with Robert, and--though much
                        against his will--become a doctor.
                        Let us take one more glimpse of our beloved composer. It was the
                        morning of August 26, 1846. The Town Hall of Birmingham, England,
                        was filled with an expectant throng, for today the composer of the
                        \x22Elijah\x22 was to conduct his greatest work, for the first time before
                        an English audience. When Mendelssohn stepped upon the platform, he
                        was greeted by a deafening shout; the reception was overwhelming, and
                        at the close the entire audience sprang to its feet in a frenzy of
                        admiration. He wrote to his brother Paul that evening: \x22No work of
                        mine ever went so admirably at the first performance, or was received
                        with such enthusiasm both by musicians and public.\x22 During April the
                        following year, four performances of the \x22Elijah\x22 took place in Exeter
                        Hall, the composer conducting, the Queen and Prince Albert being
                        present on the second occasion. This visit to England which was to be
                        his last, had used his strength to the limit of endurance, and there
                        was a shadow of a coming breakdown. Soon after he rejoined his family
                        in Frankfort, his sister Fanny suddenly passed away in Berlin.
                        The news was broken to him too quickly, and with a shriek he fell
                        unconscious to the floor."

  communication_note: "That made a total of three thousand francs, hardly gained on which he
                        had to keep a wife and child--\x22_meme deux_,\x22 as M. Tiersot says. He
                        attempted a festival at the Opera; the result was three hundred and
                        sixty francs loss. He organised a festival at the 1844 Exhibition; the
                        receipts were thirty-two thousand francs, out of which he got eight
                        hundred francs. He had the _Damnation de Faust_ performed; no one came
                        to it, and he was ruined. Things went better in Russia; but the manager
                        who brought him to England became bankrupt. He was haunted by thoughts
                        of rents and doctors bills. Towards the end of his life his financial
                        affairs mended a little, and a year before his death he uttered these
                        sad words: \x22I suffer a great deal, but I do not want to die now--I have
                        enough to live upon.\x22
                        This fine and intelligent eclecticism was likely to develop a critical
                        spirit, but was rather less adapted to form original personalities. In
                        any case, however, it was excellent discipline in the formation of
                        musical taste; and, in truth, the _Ecole Superieure de musique_ of the
                        Rue Saint-Jacques became a new Conservatoire, both more modern and more
                        learned than the old Conservatoire, and freer, and yet less free,
                        because more self-satisfied. The school developed very quickly. From
                        having twenty-one pupils in 1896, it had three hundred and twenty in
                        1908. Eminent musicians and professors learned in the history and
                        science of music taught there, and M. dIndy himself took the
                        Composition classes.[231] And in its short career the _Schola_ may
                        already be credited with the training of young composers, such as MM.
                        Roussel, Deodat de Severac, Gustave Bret, Labey, Samazeuilh, R. de
                        Castera, Serieyx, Alquier, Coindreau, Estienne, Le Flem, and Groz; and
                        to these may be added M. dIndys private pupils, Witkowski, and one of
                        the foremost of modern composers, Alberic Magnard.
                        And thus a number of years slipped away amid these happy surroundings.
                        Little Josef was now a likely lad of about fifteen years. It was
                        arranged that his younger brother Michael was to come to the Cantorei.
                        Josef looked eagerly forward to this event, planning how he would help
                        the little one over the beginning and show him the pleasant things
                        that would happen to him in the new life. But the elder brother could
                        not foresee the sorrow and privation in store for him. From the moment
                        Michaels pure young voice filled the vast spaces of the cathedral, it
                        was plain that Josefs singing could not compete with it. His soprano
                        showed signs of breaking, and gradually the principal solo parts,
                        which had always fallen to him, were given to the new chorister. On
                        a special church day, when there was more elaborate music, the \x22Salve
                        Regina,\x22 which had always been given to Josef, was sung so beautifully
                        by the little brother, that the Emperor and Empress were delighted,
                        and they presented the young singer with twenty ducats.
                        Johannes was now engaged as conductor of a Choral Society in Detmold,
                        also as Court Pianist and teacher in the royal family. The post
                        carried with it free rooms and living, and he was lodged at the Hotel
                        Stadt Frankfort, a comfortable inn, exactly opposite the Castle, and
                        thus close to the scene of his new labors."

                        To Mozart the thought of settling down in Salzburg under the
                        conditions stated in his fathers letter was distasteful, but he had
                        not the heart to withstand his fathers appeal. He set out from Paris
                        at once, promising himself just one indulgence before entering the
                        bondage which lay before him, a visit to his friends the Webers at
                        Mannheim. When he arrived there he found they had gone to Munich to
                        live. Therefore he pushed on to Munich. The Weber family received him
                        as warmly as of old, but in Aloysias eyes there was only a friendly
                        greeting, nothing more. A few short months had cooled her fickle
                        attachment for the young composer. This discovery was a bitter
                        trial to Wolfgang and he returned to his Salzburg home saddened by
                        disappointed love and ambition.

                        Another of his admirations was for Ole Bull, the famous Norwegian
                        violinist. One day in summer, probably in 1858, when Edward was
                        about fifteen, this \x22idol of his dreams\x22 rode up to the Grieg home on
                        horseback. The family had lived for the past five years at the fine
                        estate of Landaas, near Bergen. The great violinist had just returned
                        from America and was visiting his native town, for he too was born in
                        Bergen. That summer he came often to the Griegs and soon discovered
                        the great desire of young Edward for a musical career. He got the boy
                        to improvise at the piano, and also to show him the little pieces he
                        had already composed. There were consultations with father and mother,
                        and then, finally, the violinist came to the boy, stroked his cheek
                        and announced; \x22You are to go to Leipsic and become a musician.\x22"

  communication_note: "In March, 1895, Wolf lived once more, and in three months had written
                        the piano score of _Corregidor_. For many years he had been attracted
                        towards the stage, and especially towards light opera. Enthusiast though
                        he was for Wagners work, he had declared openly that it was time for
                        musicians to free themselves from the Wagnerian _Musik-Drama_. He knew
                        his own gifts, and did not aspire to take Wagners place. When one of
                        his friends offered him a subject for an opera, taken from a legend
                        about Buddha, he declined it, saying that the world did not yet
                        understand the meaning of Buddhas doctrines, and that he had no wish to
                        give humanity a fresh headache. In a letter to Grohe, on 28 June, 1890,
                        he says:
                        But Berlioz was already getting old. His daily cares and stormy domestic
                        life,[61] his disappointments and passions, his commonplace and often
                        degrading work, soon wore him out and, finally, exhausted his power.
                        \x22Would you believe it?\x22 he wrote to his friend Ferrand, \x22that which used
                        to stir me to transports of musical passion now fills me with
                        indifference, or even disdain. I feel as if I were descending a mountain
                        at a great rate. Life is so short; I notice that thoughts of the end
                        have been with me for some time past.\x22 In 1848, at forty-five years old,
                        he wrote in his _Memoires_: \x22I find myself so old and tired and lacking
                        inspiration.\x22 At forty-five years old, Wagner had patiently worked out
                        his theories and was feeling his power; at forty-five he was writing
                        _Tristan_ and _The Music of the Future_. Abused by critics, unknown to
                        the public, \x22he remained calm, in the belief that he would be master of
                        the musical world in fifty years time.\x22[62]
                        The progress of musical criticism was just as rapid. Professors of
                        faculties, old pupils of the Ecole Normale Superieure, or the Ecole des
                        Chartes, such as Henri Lichtenberger, Louis Laloy, and Pierre Aubrey,
                        examined works of the past, and even of the present, by the exact
                        methods of historical criticism. Choir-masters and organists of great
                        erudition, such as Andre Pirro and Gastoue, and composers like Vincent
                        dIndy, Dukas, Debussy, and some others, analysed their art with the
                        confidence that the intimate knowledge of its practice brings. A
                        perfect efflorescence of works on music appeared. A galaxy of
                        distinguished writers and a public were found to support two separate
                        collections of Biographies of Musicians (which were issued at the same
                        time by different publishers), as well as five or six good musical
                        journals of a scientific character, some of which rivalled the best in
                        Germany. And, finally, the French section of the _Societe Internationale
                        de Musique_, which was founded in 1899 in Berlin to establish
                        communication between the scholars of all countries, found so favourable
                        a ground with us that the number of its adherents in Paris alone is now
                        over one hundred.

  communication_note: "Shortly afterward, the Philadelphia Orchestra and its blond, romantic
                        conductor invaded New York. Their Tuesday night concerts at Carnegie
                        Hall became the rage. The uninhibited music lovers of this town not
                        only applauded Stoky but cheered, yelled and stamped to express their
                        frenzied approval. He never lectured THEM.
                        On June 18, 1821, came the first performance of Webers masterpiece,
                        \x22Der Freischetz.\x22 The theater was beseiged for hours by eager crowds,
                        and when the doors were at last opened, there was a grand rush to
                        enter. The whole house from pit to galleries was soon filled, and
                        when the composer entered the orchestra, there was a roar of applause,
                        which it seemed would never end. As the performance proceeded, the
                        listeners became more charmed and carried away, and at the close there
                        was a wild scene of excitement. The success had been tremendous, and
                        the frequent repetitions demanded soon filled the treasury of the
                        theater. Everybody was happy, the composer most of all. The melodies
                        were played on every piano in Germany and whistled by every street
                        urchin. Its fame spread like lightning over Europe, and quickly
                        reached England. In London the whole atmosphere seemed to vibrate with
                        its melodies. In Paris, however, it did not please on first hearing,
                        perhaps because it was so thoroughly German. But somewhat later, when
                        renamed \x22Robin des Bois,\x22--\x22Robin of the Forest,\x22--it was performed
                        some three hundred and fifty times before being withdrawn.
                        At the time when I was feeling Wagners seductiveness so strongly there
                        were always some carping people among my elders ready to quench my
                        admiration and say with a superior smile: \x22That is nothing. One cant
                        judge Wagner at a concert. You must hear him in the opera-house at
                        Bayreuth.\x22 Since then I have been several times to Bayreuth; I have seen
                        Wagners works performed in Berlin, in Dresden, in Munich, and in other
                        German towns, but I have never again felt the old intoxication. People
                        are wrong to pretend that closer acquaintance with a fine work adds to
                        ones enjoyment of it. It may throw light upon it, but it nips ones
                        imagination and dispels the mystery. The puzzling fragments one hears at
                        concerts will take on splendid proportions on account of all the mind
                        adds to them. That epic poem of the _Niebelungen_ was once like a forest
                        in our dreams, where strange and awful beings flashed before our vision
                        and then vanished. Later on, when we had explored all its paths, we
                        discovered that order and reason reigned in the midst of this apparent
                        jungle; and when we came to know the least wrinkle on the faces of its
                        inhabitants, the confusion and emotion of other days no longer filled
                        us."

  communication_note: "Little Franz was born in the eventful year of 1811,--the \x22year of the
                        comet.\x22 The night of October 21, the night of his birth, the tail
                        of the meteor seemed to light up the roof of the Liszt home and was
                        regarded as an omen of destiny. His mother used to say he was always
                        cheerful, loving, never naughty but most obedient. The child seemed
                        religious by nature, which feeling was fostered by his good mother. He
                        loved to go to church on Sundays and fast days. The midnight mass on
                        Christmas eve, when Adam Liszt, carrying a lantern, led the way to
                        church along the country road, through the silent night, filled the
                        childs thoughts with mystic awe.
                        Then, in 1890, there were signs of a movement that was in revolt against
                        its despotism. The great wind from the East began to drop, and veered to
                        the North. Scandinavian and Russian influences were making themselves
                        felt. An exaggerated infatuation for Grieg, though limited to a small
                        number of people, was an indication of the change in public taste. In
                        1890, Cesar Franck died in Paris. Belgian by birth and temperament, and
                        French in feeling and by musical education, he had remained outside the
                        Wagnerian movement in his own serene and fecund solitude. To his
                        intellectual greatness and the charm his personal genius held for the
                        little band of friends who knew and revered him he added the authority
                        of his knowledge. Unconsciously he brought back to us the soul of
                        Sebastian Bach, with its infinite richness and depth; and through this
                        he found himself the head of a school (without having wished it) and the
                        greatest teacher of contemporary French music. After his death, his
                        name was the means of rallying together the younger school of
                        musicians. In 1892, the _Chanteurs de Saint-Gervais_, under the
                        direction of M. Charles Bordes, reinstated to honour and popularised
                        Gregorian and Palestrinian music; and, following the initiative of their
                        director, the _Schola Cantorum_ was founded in 1894 for the revival of
                        religious music. Ambition grew with success; and from the _Schola_
                        sprang the _Ecole Superieure de Musique_, under the direction of
                        Francks most famous pupil, M. Vincent dIndy. This school, founded on a
                        solid knowledge, not only of the classics, but of the primitives in
                        music, took from its very beginning in 1900 a frankly national
                        character, and was in some ways opposed to German art. At the same time,
                        performances of Bach and seventeenth-and eighteenth-century music became
                        more and more frequent; and more intimate relationship with the artists
                        of other countries, repeated visits of the great _Kapellmeister_,
                        foreign virtuosi and composers (especially Richard Strauss), and,
                        lastly, of Russian composers, completed the education of the Parisian
                        musical public, who, after repeated rebukes from the critics, became
                        conscious of the awakening of a national personality, and of an
                        impatient desire to free itself from German tutelage. By turns it
                        gratefully and warmly received M. Bruneaus _Le Reve_ (1891), M.
                        dIndys _Fervaal_ (1898), M. Gustave Charpentiers _Louise_ (1900)--all
                        of which seemed like works of liberation. But, as a matter of fact,
                        these lyric dramas were by no means free from foreign influences, and
                        especially from Wagnerian influences. M. Debussys _Pelleas et
                        Melisande_, in 1902, seemed to mark more truly the emancipation of
                        French music. From this time on, French music felt that it had left
                        school, and claimed to have founded a new art, which reflected the
                        spirit of the race, and was freer and suppler than the Wagnerian art.
                        These ideas, which were seized upon and enlarged by the press, brought
                        about rather quickly a conviction in French artists of Frances
                        superiority in music. Is that conviction justified? The future alone can
                        tell us. But one may see by this brief outline of events how real is the
                        evolution of the musical spirit in France since 1870, in spite of the
                        apparent contradictions of fashion which appear on the surface of art.
                        It is the spirit of France that is, after long oppression and by a
                        patient but eager initiation, realising its power and wishing to
                        dominate in its turn."

                        and eager hearts. \x22There are two qualities,\x22 says M. dIndy, on the last
                        page of _Cours de Composition_, \x22which a master should try to encourage
                        and develop in the spirit of the pupil, for without them science is
                        useless; these qualities are an unselfish love of art and enthusiasm for

                        as they do from his writings; that is his power.
                        And that is why one should applaud the enterprise of Victor Charpentier,
                        who, in March, 1905, founded a Symphonic Society of amateurs called
                        _LOrchestre_, to give free hearings for the benefit of the people. And
                        in that Paris, where forty years ago one would have had a good deal of
                        trouble to get together two or three amateur quartettes, Victor
                        Charpentier has been able to count on one hundred and fifty good
                        performers,[240] who under his direction, or that of Saint-Saens or
                        Gabriel Faure, have already given seventeen free concerts, of which ten
                        were given at the Trocadero.[241] It is to be hoped that the State will
                        help forward such a generous work for the people in a rather more
                        practical way than it has done up till now.[242]"

  communication_note: "In his comfortable Weimar home the musician had the quiet and
                        leisure that he needed to perfect his art on all sides, not only in
                        composition but in organ and harpsichord playing. He felt that he had
                        conquered all difficulties of both instruments, and one day boasted
                        to a friend that he could play any piece, no matter how difficult, at
                        sight, without a mistake. In order to test this statement the friend
                        invited him to breakfast shortly after. On the harpsichord were
                        several pieces of music, one of which, though apparently simple,
                        was really very difficult. His host left the room to prepare the
                        breakfast, while Bach began to try over the music. All went well until
                        he came to the difficult piece which he began quite boldly but stuck
                        in the middle. It went no better after several attempts. As his friend
                        entered, bringing the breakfast, Bach exclaimed:--\x22You are right. One
                        cannot play everything perfectly at sight,--it is impossible!\x22
                        In 1717, on his return from Dresden, Bach was appointed Capellmeister
                        to the young Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cethen. The Prince was an
                        enthusiastic lover of music, and at Cethen Bach led a happy, busy
                        life. The Prince often journeyed to different towns to gratify his
                        taste for music, and always took Bach with him. On one of these trips
                        he was unable to receive the news that his wife had suddenly passed
                        away, and was buried before he could return to Cethen. This was a
                        severe blow to the whole family.
                        Before 1870, French music had already in the Opera and the Opera-Comique
                        (without counting the various endeavours of the Theatre Lyrique) an
                        outlet which was nearly enough for the needs of her dramatic
                        productions. Even when musical taste was most decadent, the works of
                        Gounod, Ambroise Thomas, and Masse, had always upheld the name of French
                        _opera-comique_. But what was almost entirely lacking was an outlet for
                        symphonic music and chamber-music. \x22Before 1870,\x22 wrote M. Saint-Saens
                        in _Harmonie et Melodie_, \x22a French composer who was foolish enough to
                        venture on to the ground of instrumental music had no other means of
                        getting his works performed than by himself arranging a concert for
                        them.\x22 Such was Berliozs case; for he had to gather together an
                        orchestra and hire a room each time he wished to get a hearing for his
                        great symphonies. The financial result was often disastrous: the
                        performance of the _Damnation de Faust_ in 1846 was, for example, a
                        complete failure, and he had to give it up. The Conservatoire, which was
                        formerly more hospitable, rather reluctantly performed a portion of
                        _LEnfance du Christ_; but it gave young composers no encouragement.
                        His passion for drawing was liable to break out at any moment. During
                        one of the lesson hours he was varying the monotony by drawing,
                        behind his book, a picture of his teacher, whose special facial
                        characteristic was a very large nose. Just as the sketch was finished
                        he was detected and was asked to show the result. The professor,
                        instead of being angry, considered it a remarkable likeness and asked
                        to keep it. Shortly after this the professor called on Mrs. MacDowell,
                        telling her he had shown the drawing to an eminent painter, also
                        an instructor at the ecole des Beaux Arts. The painter had been so
                        greatly impressed with the boys talent that he offered him a three
                        years course of free instruction, under his own supervision. He also
                        promised to be responsible for Edwards support during that time."

                        The following year he returned to Moscow and seemed quite his natural
                        self. A fever of energy for work took possession of him. He began a
                        new opera, \x22Eugen Onegin,\x22 and completed his Fourth Symphony, in F
                        minor. The score of the opera was finished in February, 1878, and
                        sent at once to Moscow, where the first performance was given in March
                        1879. In the beginning the opera had only a moderate success, but
                        gradually grew in favor till, after five years, it was performed
                        in St. Petersburg and had an excellent reception. It is considered
                        Tschaikowskys most successful opera, sharing with Glinkas \x22Life of
                        the Tsar\x22 the popularity of Russian opera. In 1881 he was invited
                        to compose an orchestral work for the consecration of the Temple of
                        Christ in Moscow. The \x22Solemn Overture 1812,\x22 Op. 49, was the outcome
                        of this. Later in the year he completed the Second Piano Concerto.
                        The Piano Trio in A minor, \x22To the memory of a great artist,\x22 Op.
                        50, refers to his friend and former master, Nicholas Rubinstein, who
                        passed away in Paris, in 1881.
                        The growing success of \x22Armide\x22 only added fuel to the flame of
                        controversy which had been stirred up. To cap the climax, Piccini
                        had finished his opera, which was duly brought out and met with a
                        brilliant reception. Indeed its success was greater than that won by
                        \x22Armide,\x22 much to the delight of the Piccinists. Of course the natural
                        outcome was that the other party should do something to surpass the
                        work of their rivals. Marie Antoinette was besought to prevail on
                        Gluck to write another opera.
                        He now claimed the hand of his chosen love and established in the book
                        business, labored so unceasingly, that the business increased. Then
                        he moved to a more favorable location, choosing the mining town of
                        Zwickau, in Saxony."

                        At Oxford, in July, he received the honorary degree of Doctor of
                        Music, and three great concerts were given in his honor, with special
                        performers brought from London. In fact the whole visit to England had
                        been such a success that he repeated the trip in 1794, and received
                        even greater honors. His symphonies were heard on all London
                        programs. He was the lion of the season, and was frequently invited to
                        Buckingham Palace to play for the King and Queen, who always urged
                        him to live in England. Haydn was now sixty-five; he had composed
                        quantities of music, but his greatest work, \x22The Creation,\x22 was not
                        yet written. While in London, Salomon had shown him a poem founded on
                        \x22Paradise Lost,\x22 written years before in the hope that Handel would
                        use it for an oratorio. Haydn decided to try his hand at oratorio on
                        this subject. As he went on, it grew to be a labor of love and prayer.
                        It was finished and performed in Vienna, March 19, 1799, and made
                        a profound impression. The composer at once began work on a second
                        oratorio, founded on Thompsons \x22Seasons.\x22 The desire for work was
                        strong within, but his health was failing. \x22The Seasons gave me my
                        finishing stroke,\x22 he often remarked to friends.
                        Little Josef was born March 31, 1732. The mother had a secret desire
                        that the boy should join the priesthood, but the father, as we have
                        seen, hoped he would make a musical career, and determined, though
                        poor in this worlds goods, to aid him in every possible way.
                        In speaking of the moral reasons of the success of _Pelleas et
                        Melisande_, I would like to draw your attention to a form of thought
                        which is not confined to France, but which is common nowadays in a
                        section of the more distinguished members of European society, and which
                        has found expression in _Pelleas et Melisande_. The atmosphere in which
                        Maeterlincks drama moves makes one feel the melancholy resignation of
                        the will to Fate. We are shown that nothing can change the order of
                        events; that, despite our proud illusions, we are not master of
                        ourselves, but the servant of unknown and irresistible forces, which
                        direct the whole tragicomedy of our lives. We are told that no man is
                        responsible for what he likes and what he loves--that is if he knows
                        what he likes and loves--and that he lives and dies without knowing why."

                        a year among them. For it was not till March 23, 1743, that the
                        \x22Messiah\x22 was performed in London. The King was one of the great
                        audience who heard it. All were so deeply impressed by the Hallelujah

                        feet, and remained standing through the entire chorus. From that time
                        to this it has always been the custom to stand during this chorus,
                        whenever it is performed.

                        reminiscences and an atmosphere of classicism. I cannot help thinking
                        that Mahlers position as director of the Opera, and his consequent
                        saturation in the music that his calling condemns him to study, is the
                        cause of this. There is nothing more fatal to a creative spirit than too
                        much reading, above all when it does not read of its own free will, but
                        is forced to absorb an excessive amount of nourishment, the larger part
                        of which is indigestible. In vain may Mahler try to defend the sanctuary
                        of his mind; it is violated by foreign ideas coming from all parts, and
                        instead of being able to drive them away, his conscience, as conductor
                        of the orchestra, obliges him to receive them and almost embrace them.
                        With his feverish activity, and burdened as he is with heavy tasks, he
                        works unceasingly and has no time to dream. Mahler will only be Mahler
                        when he is able to leave his administrative work, shut up his scores,
                        retire within himself, and wait patiently until he has become himself
                        again--if it is not too late.
                        The boy had his first piano lessons when he was about eight years old,
                        from a family friend, Mr. Juan Buitrago, a native of Bogota, South
                        America. Mr. Buitrago became greatly interested in Edward and asked
                        permission to teach him his notes. At that time the boy was not
                        considered a prodigy, or even precocious, though he seemed to have
                        various gifts. He was fond of covering his music and exercise books
                        with little drawings, which showed he had the innate skill of a born
                        artist. Then he liked to scribble bits of verses and stories and
                        invent fairy tales. He could improvise little themes at the piano, but
                        was not fond of technical drudgery at the instrument in those early
                        days.
                        Genius has a right to be what it will--to trample underfoot, if it
                        wishes, taste and morals and the whole of society. But when those who
                        are not geniuses wish to do the same thing they only make themselves
                        ridiculous and odious. There have been too many monkey Wagners in
                        France. During the last ten or twenty years scarcely one French musician
                        has escaped Wagners influence. One understands only too well the revolt
                        of the French mind, in the name of naturalness and good taste, against
                        exaggerations and extremes of passion, whether sincere or not. _Pelleas
                        et Melisande_ came as a manifestation of this revolt. It is an
                        uncompromising reaction against over-emphasis and excess, and against
                        anything that oversteps the limits of the imagination. This distaste of
                        exaggerated words and sentiments results in what is like a fear of
                        showing the feelings at all, even when they are most deeply stirred.
                        With Debussy the passions almost whisper; and it is by the imperceptible
                        vibrations of the melodic line that the love in the hearts of the
                        unhappy couple is shown, by the timid \x22Oh, why are you going?\x22 at the
                        end of the first act, and the quiet \x22I love you, too,\x22 in the last scene
                        but one. Think of the wild lamentations of the dying Ysolde, and then of
                        the death of Melisande, without cries and without words.
                        But M. Buchor did not remain content to be a poet of popular song.
                        During the last twelve years he has made, with untiring energy, a tour
                        of all the Ecoles Normales in France, returning several times to places
                        where he found signs of good vocal ability. In each school he made the
                        pupils sing his songs--in unison, or in two or three parts, sometimes
                        massing the boys and girls schools of one town together. His ambition
                        grew with his success; and to the folk-song melodies[245] he began
                        gradually to add pieces of classical music. And to impress the music
                        better on the singers he changed the existing words, and tried to find
                        others, which by their moral and poetic beauty more exactly translated
                        the musical feeling.[246]"

  communication_note: "\x22He was a most unusual looking young musician, hardly more than a boy,
                        in his short summer coat, with his high-pitched voice and long fair
                        hair. Especially fine was his energetic, characteristic mouth, and his
                        earnest, deep gaze. His constitution was thoroughly healthy; the most
                        strenuous mental exercise hardly fatigued him and he could go to sleep
                        at any hour of the day he pleased. He was apt to be full of pranks,
                        too. At the piano he dominated by his characteristic, powerful, and
                        when necessary, extraordinarily tender playing.\x22 Schumann, whom he now
                        came to know in Desseldorf, called him the \x22young eagle--one of the
                        elect.\x22 In fact Schumann, in his musical journal, praised the young
                        musician most highly. And his kindness did not stop there. He wrote to
                        Hannes father, Jakob Brahms, in Hamburg, commending in glowing terms
                        his sons compositions. This letter was sent to Johannes and the
                        result was the offering of some of his compositions to Breitkopf and
                        Hertel for publication. He had already written two Sonatas, a Scherzo,
                        and a Sonata for piano and violin. The Sonata in C, now known as Op.
                        I, although not his first work, was the one in which he introduced
                        himself to the public. For, as he said: \x22When one first shows ones
                        self, it is to the head and not to the heels that one wishes to draw
                        attention.\x22
                        But the musical part of _Tristan_ is not free either from the faults of
                        the work as a whole, for it, too, lacks unity. Wagners music is made up
                        of very diverse styles: one finds in it Italianisms and Germanisms and
                        even Gallicisms of every kind; there are some that are sublime, some
                        that are commonplace; and at times one feels the awkwardness of their
                        union and the imperfections of their form. Then again, perhaps two ideas
                        of equal originality come together and spoil each other by making too
                        strong a contrast. The fine lamentation of King Mark--that
                        personification of a knight of the Grail--is treated with such
                        moderation and with so noble a scorn for outward show, that its pure,
                        cold light is entirely lost after the glowing fire of the duet.
                        Richard Strauss is both a poet and a musician. These two natures live
                        together in him, and each strives to get the better of the other. The
                        balance is not always well maintained; but when he does succeed in
                        keeping it by sheer force of will the union of these two talents,
                        directed to the same end, produces an effect more powerful than any
                        known since Wagners time. Both natures have their source in a mind
                        filled with heroic thoughts--a rarer possession, I consider, than a
                        talent for either music or poetry. There are other great musicians in
                        Europe; but Strauss is something more than a great musician, for he is
                        able to create a hero.
                        On one of these tours he arrived in Dresden in time to learn of a
                        French player who had just come to town. Jean Marchand had won a great
                        reputation in France, where he was organist to the King at Versailles,
                        and regarded as the most fashionable musician of the day. All this had
                        made him very conceited and overbearing. Every one was discussing the
                        Frenchmans wonderful playing and it was whispered he had been offered
                        an appointment in Dresden."

  communication_note: "He remained some time in Florence and composed the opera \x22Rodrigo,\x22
                        which was performed with great success. While in Venice he brought
                        out another opera, \x22Agrippina,\x22 which had even greater success. Rome
                        delighted him especially and he returned for a second time in 1709.
                        Here he composed his first oratorio, the \x22Resurrection,\x22 which was
                        produced there. Handel returned to Germany the following year. The
                        Elector of Hanover was kind to him, and offered him the post of
                        Capellmeister, with a salary of about fifteen hundred dollars. He
                        had long desired to visit England, and the Elector gave him leave of
                        absence. First, however, he went to Halle to see his mother and his
                        old teacher. We can imagine the joy of the meeting, and how proud and
                        happy both were at the success of the young musician. After a little
                        time spent with his dear ones, he set out for England.

                        pilgrimage to Meylan, near Grenoble, to see her. He was then sixty-one
                        years old and she was nearly seventy. \x22The past! the past! O Time!

  communication_note: "In the autumn of this year, Johann paid his third visit to Detmold,
                        and found himself socially as well as musically the fashion. It was
                        the correct thing to have lessons from him and his presence gave
                        distinction to any assemblage. But Johann did not wish to waste his
                        time at social functions; when obliged to be present at some of these
                        events he would remain silent the entire evening, or else say sharp
                        or biting things, making the hosts regret they had asked him. His
                        relations with the Court family, however, remained very pleasant.
                        Yet he began to chafe under the constant demands on his time, and the
                        rigid etiquette of the little Court. The next season he definitely
                        declined the invitation to revisit Detmold, the reason given was that
                        he had not the time, as he was supervising the publication of a number
                        of his works. Brahms had become interested in writing for the voice,
                        and had already composed any number of beautiful vocal solos and part
                        songs.
                        Richard Strauss is thirty-four years old.[167] He was born in Munich on
                        11 June, 1864. His father, a well-known virtuoso, was first horn in the
                        Royal orchestra, and his mother was a daughter of the brewer Pschorr. He
                        was brought up among musical surroundings. At four years old he played
                        the piano, and at six he composed little dances, _Lieder_, sonatas, and
                        even overtures for the orchestra. Perhaps this extreme artistic
                        precocity has had something to do with the feverish character of his
                        talents, by keeping his nerves in a state of tension and unduly exciting
                        his mind. At school he composed choruses for some of Sophocles
                        tragedies. In 1881, Hermann Levi had one of the young collegians
                        symphonies performed by his orchestra. At the University he spent his
                        time in writing instrumental music. Then Buelow and Radecke made him play
                        in Berlin; and Buelow, who became very fond of him, had him brought to
                        Meiningen as _Musikdirector_. From 1886 to 1889 he held the same post at
                        the _Hoftheater_ in Munich. From 1889 to 1894 he was _Kapellmeister_ at
                        the _Hoftheater_ in Weimar. He returned to Munich in 1894 as
                        _Hofkapellmeister_, and in 1897 succeeded Hermann Levi. Finally, he left
                        Munich for Berlin, where at present he conducts the orchestra of the
                        Royal Opera.
                        [Footnote 79: It is amusing to find Wagner comparing Berlioz with Auber,
                        as the type of a true French musician--Auber and his mixed Italian and
                        German opera. That shows how Wagner, like most Germans, was incapable of
                        grasping the real originality of French music, and how he saw only its
                        externals. The best way to find out the musical characteristics of a
                        nation is to study its folk-songs. If only someone would devote himself
                        to the study of French folk-song (and there is no lack of material),
                        people would realise perhaps how much it differs from German folk-song,
                        and how the temperament of the French race shows itself there as being
                        sweeter and freer, more vigorous and more expressive.]
                        Things were going from bad to worse in the Beethoven home, and in the
                        hope of bettering these unhappy conditions, Frau Beethoven undertook
                        a trip through Holland with her boy, hoping that his playing in the
                        homes of the wealthy might produce some money. The tour was successful
                        in that it relieved the pressing necessities of the moment, but the
                        sturdy, independent spirit of the boy showed itself even then. \x22The
                        Dutch are very stingy, and I shall take care not to trouble them
                        again,\x22 he remarked to a friend."

                        The popular art that he extols is not an art belonging to the people,
                        but that of an aristocracy interested in the people. He wishes to
                        enlighten them, to mould them, to direct them, by means of art. Art is
                        the source of life; it is the spirit of progress; it gives the most
                        precious of possessions to the soul--liberty. And no one enjoys this
                        liberty more than the artist. In a lecture to the _Schola_ he said:

                        forward the growth of art? It is interesting to know the ideas,
                        even the erroneous ideas, of geniuses and men of great talent, such
                        as Goethe, Schumann, Wagner, Sainte-Beuve, and Michelet, when they
                        wish to indulge in criticism; but it is of no interest at all to

  communication_note: "Finally, this Gothic spirit shows itself--in a less original way, it is
                        true--in M. dIndys religious antipathies, which, in spite of the
                        authors goodness of heart and great personal tolerance, constantly
                        break out against the two faiths that are rivals to his own; and to them
                        he attributes all the faults of art and all the vices of humanity. Each
                        has its offence. Protestantism is made responsible for the extremes of
                        individualism;[146] and Judaism, for the absurdities of its customs and
                        the weakness of its moral sense.[147] I do not know which of the two is
                        the more soundly belaboured; the second has the privilege of being so,
                        not only in writing, but in pictures.[148] The worst of it is, these
                        antipathies are apt to spoil the fairness of M. dIndys artistic
                        judgment. It goes without saying that the Jewish musicians are treated
                        with scant consideration; and even the great Protestant musicians,
                        giants in their art, do not escape rebuke. If Goudimel is mentioned, it
                        is because he was Palestrinas master, and his achievement of \x22turning
                        the Calvinist psalms into chorales\x22 is dismissed as being of little
                        importance.[149]
                        One day in February 1854, his physician made a noon call upon him.
                        They sat chatting when suddenly Schumann left the room without a word.
                        The doctor and his friends supposed he would return. His wife went in
                        search of him. It seems he had left the house in dressing-gown, gone
                        to the Rhine bridge and thrown himself into the river. Some sailors
                        rescued him.
                        On June 18, 1821, came the first performance of Webers masterpiece,
                        \x22Der Freischetz.\x22 The theater was beseiged for hours by eager crowds,
                        and when the doors were at last opened, there was a grand rush to
                        enter. The whole house from pit to galleries was soon filled, and
                        when the composer entered the orchestra, there was a roar of applause,
                        which it seemed would never end. As the performance proceeded, the
                        listeners became more charmed and carried away, and at the close there
                        was a wild scene of excitement. The success had been tremendous, and
                        the frequent repetitions demanded soon filled the treasury of the
                        theater. Everybody was happy, the composer most of all. The melodies
                        were played on every piano in Germany and whistled by every street
                        urchin. Its fame spread like lightning over Europe, and quickly
                        reached England. In London the whole atmosphere seemed to vibrate with
                        its melodies. In Paris, however, it did not please on first hearing,
                        perhaps because it was so thoroughly German. But somewhat later, when
                        renamed \x22Robin des Bois,\x22--\x22Robin of the Forest,\x22--it was performed
                        some three hundred and fifty times before being withdrawn."

                        hundred and thirty provincial towns; more than one hundred and fifty
                        concerts in Paris, of which fifty were of orchestral and choral music,
                        sixty of organ music, and forty of chamber-music. These concerts have
                        been well attended by enthusiastic and appreciative audiences, and have
                        been a school for public taste. One does not look for perfect execution

                        fuller knowledge of the great works of the past. They have revived
                        Monteverdes _Orfeo_ and his _Incoronazione di Poppea_, which had been
                        forgotten these three centuries; and it was following an interest
                        created by repeated performances of Rameau at the _Schola_[233] that
                        _Dardanus_ was performed at Dijon under M. dIndys direction, _Castor
                        et Pollux_ at Montpellier under M. Charles Bordes direction, and that
                        in 1908 the Opera at Paris gave _Hippolyte et Aricie_. Branches of the
                        _Schola_ have, been started at Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Avignon,
                        Montpellier, Nancy, Epinal, Montlucon, Saint-Chamond, and
                        Saint-Jean-deLuz.[234] A publishing house has been associated with the
                        School at Paris; and from this we get Reviews, such as the _Tribune de
                        Saint-Gervais_; publications of old music, such as the _Anthologie des
                        maitres religieux primitifs des XVe, XVIe, et XVIIe siecles_, edited by
                        Charles Bordes; the _Archives des maitres de lorgue des XVIe, XVIIe, et

                        _Concerts spirituels de la Schola_, the new editions of _Orfeo_, and the
                        _Incoronazione di Poppea_, edited by M. Vincent dIndy; and publications
                        of modern music, such as the _Collection du chant populaire_, the
                        _Repertoire moderne de musique vocale et dorgue_, and, notably, the
                        _Edition mutuelle_, published by the composers themselves, whose
                        property it is.

                        a girl to provide for, and as there was nothing to depend on but
                        the school-masters pay, it is easy to see the family was in poor
                        circumstances, though the wife managed most carefully to make ends
                        meet. They were a very devoted family altogether. Little Franz early
                        showed a decided fondness for music, and tried to pick out bits
                        of tunes of his own by ear on an old dilapidated piano the family
                        possessed. He made friends with a young apprentice who took him
                        sometimes to a piano wareroom in the city, where he was allowed to
                        play his little tunes on a fine piano."

                        working on the \x22Damnation of Faust.\x22 In the fall he returned to Paris.
                        The vision of his Ophelia, as he used to call Miss Smithson, was
                        seldom long absent from his thoughts, and he now went to the house
                        where she used to live, thinking himself very lucky to be able to find
                        lodging there. Meeting the old servant, he learned Miss Smithson was
                        again in Paris, and would manage a new English theater, which was
                        to open in a few days. But Berlioz was planning a concert of his own
                        compositions, and did not trust himself to see the woman he had so
                        long adored until this venture was over. It happened, however, that
                        some friends induced her to attend the concert, the success of which
                        is said to have been tremendous. The composer had the happiness of
                        meeting the actress the same evening. The next day he called on her.
                        Their engagement lasted nearly a year, opposed by her mother and
                        sister, and also by Hectors family. The following summer Henrietta
                        Smithson, all but ruined from her theatrical ventures, and weak from
                        a fall, which made her a cripple for some years, was married to Hector
                        Berlioz, in spite of the opposition of their two families.
                        Little Robert at six was sent to a popular private school and now for
                        the first time mingled with a number of children of his own age.
                        The first symptoms of ambition, the source of much of his later
                        achievement, began to show itself, though quite unconsciously. It made
                        him the life of all childish games. If the children played \x22soldiers,\x22
                        little Robert was always captain. The others loved his good nature and
                        friendliness, and always yielded to him.
                        After a summer spent quietly with his parents at Landaas, he began
                        to prepare for coming musical activities. The next season he gave
                        his first concert in Bergen, at which the piano pieces of Op. 1, Four
                        Songs for Alto, and a String Quartet were played. With the proceeds
                        of this concert he bought orchestral and chamber music, and began to
                        study score, which he had not previously learned to do. In the spring
                        of 1863--he was hardly twenty then--he left home and took up his
                        residence in Copenhagen, a much larger city, offering greater
                        opportunities for an ambitious young musician. It was also the home of
                        Niels W. Gade, the foremost Scandinavian composer.
                        Of course his nature is too dignified to let the quarrel be shown
                        openly. His heart obeys the commands of his reason, or compromises with
                        it, and by seeming respectful of authority saves appearances. His
                        reason, represented here by the poet, likes simple, realistic, and
                        relevant action, together with moral or even religious teaching. His
                        heart, represented by the musician, is romantic; and if he followed it
                        altogether he would wander off to any subject that enabled him to
                        indulge in his love of the picturesque, such as the descriptive
                        symphony, or even the old form of opera."

  communication_subject: "But the rancour of his failure at the theatre still remained with Strauss, and he turned his attention again to the symphonic poem, in which he showed more and more marked dramatic tendencies, and a soul which grew daily prouder and more scornful."
  communication_note: "I shall not say much about the four first works, where the mind and
                        manner of the artist is taking shape. The _Wanderers Sturmlied_ (the
                        song of a traveller during a storm, op. 14) is a vocal sextette with an
                        orchestral accompaniment, whose subject is taken from a poem of
                        Goethes. It was written before Strauss met Ritter, and its construction
                        is after the manner of Brahms, and shows a rather affected thought and
                        style. _Aus Italien_ (op. 16) is an exuberant picture of impressions of
                        his tour in Italy, of the ruins at Rome, the seashore at Sorrento, and
                        the life of the Italian people. _Macbeth_ (op. 23) gives us a rather
                        undistinguished series of musical interpretations of poetical subjects.
                        _Don Juan_ (op. 20) is much finer, and translates Lenaus poem into
                        music with bombastic vigour, showing us the hero who dreams of grasping
                        all the joy of the world, and how he fails, and dies after he has lost
                        faith in everything.
                        The parents listened to their wonder-child with ever increasing
                        astonishment, mingled with tears of emotion. It was plain to be seen
                        that Wolfgang must have lessons as well as Nannerl. And what joy it
                        would be to teach them both.
                        Up to the age of fifteen, Frederic was taught at home, in his fathers
                        school. He now entered the Warsaw Lyceum, and proved a good student,
                        twice carrying off a prize. With this studiousness was joined a gaiety
                        and sprightliness that manifested itself in all sorts of fun and
                        mischief. He loved to play pranks on his sisters, comrades and others,
                        and had a fondness for caricature, taking off the peculiarities of
                        those about him with pose and pen. Indeed it was the opinion of a
                        clever member of the profession, that the lad was born to become a
                        great actor. All the young Chopins had a great fondness for literature
                        and writing; they occasionally tried their hand at poetry, and the
                        production of original one-act plays, written for birthday fetes and
                        family parties.
                        The boys name was George Frederick Handel, and he was born in the
                        German town of Halle, February 23, 1685. Almost from infancy he showed
                        a remarkable fondness for music. His toys must be able to produce
                        musical sounds or he did not care for them. The child did not inherit
                        a love for music from his father, for Dr. Handel, who was a surgeon,
                        looked on music with contempt, as something beneath the notice of a
                        gentleman. He had decided his son was to be a lawyer, and refused
                        to allow him to attend school for fear some one might teach him his
                        notes. The mother was a sweet gentle woman, a second wife, and much
                        younger than her husband, who seemed to have ruled his household with
                        a rod of iron."

                        secluded in his drawing room, perhaps asleep, but more likely trying
                        to digest three helpings of creamed oysters in which he had indulged

                        days couldnt let creamed oysters alone, but neither could he take
                        them.
                        Above all, one must not make the mistake of contrasting Berlioz with
                        Wagner, either by sacrificing Berlioz to that Germanic Odin, or by
                        forcibly trying to reconcile one to the other. For there are some who
                        condemn Berlioz in the name of Wagners theories; and others who, not
                        liking the sacrifice, seek to make him a forerunner of Wagner, or kind
                        of elder brother, whose mission was to clear a way and prepare a road
                        for a genius greater than his own. Nothing is falser. To understand
                        Berlioz one must shake off the hypnotic influence of Bayreuth. Though
                        Wagner may have learnt something from Berlioz, the two composers have
                        nothing in common; their genius and their art are absolutely opposed;
                        each one has ploughed his furrow in a different field.
                        \x22The discouragement of work, the weakening of character, the
                        sharing of ones goods under pain of death--this is the Gospel
                        teaching on the foundation of society.\x22
                        But the main thing was that Wolfs creative genius had returned. In
                        April, 1896, he wrote straight away the twenty-two songs of the second
                        volume of the _Italienisches-Liederbuch_. At Christmas his friend Mueller
                        sent him some of Michelangelos poems, translated into German by Walter
                        Robert-Tornow; and Wolf, deeply moved by their beauty, decided at once
                        to devote a whole volume of _Lieder_ to them. In 1897 he composed the
                        first three melodies. At the same time he was also working at a new
                        opera, _Manuel Venegas_, a poem by Moritz Hoernes, written after the
                        style of Alarcon. He seemed full of strength and happiness and
                        confidence in his renewed health. Mueller was speaking to him of the
                        premature death of Schubert, and Wolf replied, \x22A man is not taken away
                        before he has said all he has to say.\x22"

                        the Symphony in E flat in five parts, a great work, equal to any of

                        was carefully brought up, well-bred and well-educated. When a friend

                        came to Warsaw in 1787. It was a time of unrest, when the nation was
                        struggling for liberty and independence. The young man applied himself
                        to master the language, and study the character and needs of his
                        adopted country, that he might be well informed. During the period of
                        insecurity in political affairs, the tobacco factory had to be closed
                        and Nicholas Chopin looked for other activity. A few years later we
                        find him in the household of Countess Skarbek, as a tutor to her son,
                        Frederic. Here he met his bride, Justina de Krzyzanowska, a young
                        lady of noble but poor family, whom he married in 1806. She became the
                        mother of his four children, three girls and a boy."

  communication_note: "After having sought the libretto of an opera from the whole world, from
                        poets ancient and modern,[189] and after having tried to write one
                        himself, he finally took that of Madame Rosa Mayreder, an adaptation of
                        a Spanish novelette of Don Pedro de Alarcon. This was _Corregidor_,
                        which, after having been refused by other theatres, was played in June,
                        1896, at Mannheim. The work was not a success in spite of its musical
                        qualities, and the poorness of the libretto helped on its failure.
                        The injustice of this refusal fired Sebastian with the determination
                        to get possession of the coveted book at all costs. One moonlight
                        night, long after every one had retired, he decided to put into
                        execution a project he had dreamed of for some time.
                        He felt at home in Vienna from the start, and very soon met the
                        leading lights of the Austrian capital. On November 16, he gave his
                        first concert, with the Helmesberger Quartet, and before a crowded
                        house. It was a real success for \x22Schumanns young prophet.\x22 Although
                        concert giving was distasteful, he appeared again on December 20, and
                        then gave a second concert on January 6, 1863, when he played Bachs
                        Chromatic Fantaisie, Beethovens Variations in C minor, his own Sonata
                        Op. 5, and Schumanns Sonata OP. 11."

                        articles at this time was called \x22The End of a Musician in Paris,\x22
                        and he makes the poor musician die with the words; \x22I believe in
                        God--Mozart and Beethoven.\x22 It was almost as bad as this for Wagner
                        himself. He determined to turn his back on all the intrigues and
                        hardships he had endured for over two years, and set out for the
                        homeland, which seemed the only desirable spot on earth.
                        Besides, I cannot help feeling that scenic reality takes away rather
                        than adds to the effect of these great philosophical fairylands. Malwida
                        von Meysenbug told me that at the Bayreuth festival of 1876, while she
                        was following one of the _Ring_ scenes very attentively with her
                        opera-glasses, two hands were laid over her eyes, and she heard Wagners
                        voice say impatiently: \x22Dont look so much at what is going on. Listen!\x22
                        It was good counsel. There are dilettanti who pretend that at a concert
                        the best way to enjoy Beethovens last works--where the sonority is
                        defective--is to stop the ears and read the score. One might say with
                        less of a paradox that the best way to follow a performance of Wagners
                        operas is to listen with the eyes shut. So perfect is the music, so
                        powerful its hold on the imagination, that it leaves nothing to be
                        desired; what it suggests to the mind is infinitely finer than what the
                        eyes may see. I have never shared the opinion that Wagners works may
                        be best appreciated in the theatre. His works are epic symphonies. As a
                        frame for them I should like temples; as scenery, the illimitable land
                        of thought; as actors, our dreams."

  communication_note: "Not many years have passed since then; yet the sky is already a little
                        clouded, the light not quite so bright. Hope has not failed; but it has
                        not been fulfilled. France is waiting, and is getting a little
                        impatient. But the impatience is unnecessary; for to found an art we
                        must bring time to our aid; art must ripen tranquilly. Yet tranquillity
                        is what is most lacking in Parisian art. The artists, instead of working
                        steadily at their own tasks and uniting in a common aim, are given up to
                        sterile disputes. The young French school hardly exists any longer, as
                        it has now split up into two or three parties. To a fight against
                        foreign art has succeeded a fight among themselves: it is the
                        deep-rooted evil of the country, this vain expenditure of force. And
                        most curious of all is the fact that the quarrel is not between the
                        conservatives and the progressives in music, but between the two most
                        advanced sections: the _Schola_ on the one hand, who, should it gain the
                        victory, would through its dogmas and traditions inevitably develop the
                        airs of a little academy; and, on the other hand, the independent party,
                        whose most important representative is M. Debussy. It is not for us to
                        enter into the quarrel; we would only suggest to the parties in question
                        that if any profit is to result from their misunderstanding, it will be
                        derived by a third party--the party in favour of routine, the party that
                        has never lost favour with the great theatre-going public,--a party
                        that will soon make good the place it has lost if those who aim at
                        defending art set about fighting one another. Victory has been
                        proclaimed too soon; for whatever the optimistic representatives of the
                        young school may say, victory has not yet been gained; and it will not
                        be gained for some time yet--not until public taste is changed, not
                        while the nation lacks musical education, nor until the cultured few are
                        united to the people, through whom their thoughts shall be preserved.
                        For not only--with a few rare and generous exceptions--do the more
                        aristocratic sections of society ignore the education of the people, but
                        they ignore the very existence of the peoples soul. Here and there, a
                        composer--such as Bizet and M. Saint-Saens, or M. dIndy and his
                        disciples--will build up symphonies and rhapsodies and very difficult
                        pieces for the piano on the popular airs of Auvergne, Provence, or the
                        Cevennes; but that is only a whim of theirs, a little ingenious pastime
                        for clever artists, such as the Flemish masters of the fifteenth century
                        indulged in when they decorated popular airs with polyphonic
                        elaborations. In spite of the advance of the democratic spirit, musical
                        art--or at least all that counts in musical art--has never been more
                        aristocratic than it is to-day. Probably the phenomenon is not peculiar
                        to music, and shows itself more or less in other arts; but in no other
                        art is it so dangerous, for no other has roots less firmly fixed in the
                        soil of France. And it is no consolation to tell oneself that this is
                        according to the great French traditions, which have nearly always been
                        aristocratic. Traditions, great and small, are menaced to-day; the axe
                        is ready for them. Whoever wishes to live must adapt himself to the new
                        conditions of life. The future of art is at stake. To continue as we are
                        doing is not only to weaken music by condemning it to live in unhealthy
                        conditions, but also to risk its disappearing sooner or later under the
                        rising flood of popular misconceptions of music. Let us take warning by
                        the fact that we have already had to defend music[260] when it was
                        attacked at some of the parliamentary assemblies; and let us remember
                        the pitifulness of the defence. We must not let the day come when a
                        famous speech will be repeated with a slight alteration--\x22The Republic
                        has no need of musicians.\x22
                        The title rele was taken by Henrietta Sontag, a young girl, still in
                        her teens, though giving high promise of the great things she achieved
                        a few years later. Strange to say, a short time after its first
                        appearance, \x22Euryanthe\x22 failed to draw. One reason might have been
                        laid to the poor libretto, another to the rumor, started, it is said,
                        by no less an authority than the great master Beethoven, that the
                        music of the opera was \x22only a collection of diminished sevenths.\x22
                        Later on, he achieved success by a long and painful struggle, in which
                        he had to fight against the kind of stupid criticism that condemned him
                        \x22to listen to one of Beethovens symphonies as a penance likely to give
                        him the most excruciating torture.\x22[111] And yet after this, and after
                        his admission to the Academy, after _Henry VIII_ and the _Symphonie avec

                        not been lost upon Richard Strauss, who has just published a German
                        edition of the work, and some of whose most famous orchestral effects
                        are realisations of Berliozs ideas.]"

  communication_subject: "This then was the birthplace of the \x22most poetical composer who ever lived,\x22 as Liszt said of him; the man who created over six hundred songs, eight symphonies, operas, masses, chamber works and much beautiful piano music, and yet only lived to be thirty-one."
  communication_note: "I have dwelt rather at length on this drama on account of the real value
                        of its thought and, above all, on account of what one may call its
                        autobiographical interest. It was at this time that Strausss mind began
                        to take more definite form. His further experience will develop that
                        form still more, but without making any important change in it.
                        To this pair was born, probably in 1526, a boy whom they named
                        Giovanni Pierluigi, which means John Peter Louis. This boy, from a
                        tiniest child, loved beauty of sight and sound. And this is not at
                        all surprising, for a child surrounded from infancy by the natural
                        loveliness and glory of old Palestrina, would unconsciously breathe in
                        a sense of beauty and grandeur.
                        One music drama remained to be written--his last. Failing health
                        prevented the completion of the drama until 1882. The first
                        performance of this noble work was given on July 26, followed by
                        fifteen other hearings. After the exertions attending these, Wagner
                        and his wife, their son Siegfried, Liszt and other friends, went to
                        Italy and occupied the Vendramin Palace, on the Grand Canal, Venice.
                        Here he lived quietly and comfortably, surrounded by those he loved.
                        His health failed more and more, the end coming February 13, 1883."

                        thrilling performances of that wizard of the violin, Paganini,
                        who appeared in Paris in 1831. This style of playing made a deep
                        impression on Liszt. He now tried to do on the piano what Paganini
                        accomplished on the violin, in the matter of tone quality and
                        intensity. He procured the newly published Caprices for violin and
                        tried to learn their tonal secrets, also transcribing the pieces for

  communication_note: "When Ludwig was nine his father, regarding him with satisfaction and
                        some pride, declared he could teach him no more--and another master
                        must be found. Those childhood years of hard toil had resulted in
                        remarkable progress, even with the sort of teaching he had received.
                        The circumstances of the family had not improved, for poverty had
                        become acute, as the father became more and more addicted to drink.
                        Just at this time, a new lodger appeared, who was something of a
                        musician, and arranged to teach the boy in part payment for his room.
                        Ludwig wondered if he would turn out to be a more severe taskmaster
                        than his father had been. The times and seasons when his instruction
                        was given were at least unusual. Tobias Pfeiffer, as the new lodger
                        was called, soon discovered that father Beethoven generally spent his
                        evenings at the tavern. As an act of kindness, to keep his drunken
                        landlord out of the way of the police, Tobias used to go to the tavern
                        late at night and bring him safely home. Then he would go to the
                        bedside of the sleeping boy, and awake him by telling him it was time
                        for practice. The two would go to the living room, where they would
                        play together for several hours, improvising on original themes and
                        playing duets. This went on for about a year; meanwhile Ludwig studied
                        Latin, French, Italian and logic. He also had organ lessons."

  communication_subject: "I admit I cannot read this delightful criticism without laughing; and it does not affect me painfully like Nietzsches pernicious and morbid irony."
  communication_note: "He is an idealist with unbounded faith in the power of the mind and the
                        liberating virtue of art. This idealism is at first religious, as in
                        _Tod und Verklaerung_, and tender and compassionate as a woman, and full
                        of youthful illusions, as in _Guntram_. Then it becomes vexed and
                        indignant with the baseness of the world and the difficulties it
                        encounters. Its scorn increases, and becomes sarcastic _(Till
                        Eulenspiegel)_; it is exasperated with years of conflict, and, in
                        increasing bitterness, develops into a contemptuous heroism. How
                        Strausss laugh whips and stings us in _Zarathustra_! How his will
                        bruises and cuts us in _Heldenleben_! Now that he has proved his power
                        by victory, his pride knows no limit; he is elated and is unable to see
                        that his lofty visions have become realities. But the people whose
                        spirit he reflects see it. There are germs of morbidity in Germany
                        to-day, a frenzy of pride, a belief in self, and a scorn for others that
                        recalls France in the seventeenth century. \x22_Dem Deutschen gehoert die
                        Welt_\x22 (\x22Germany possesses the world\x22) calmly say the prints displayed
                        in the shop windows in Berlin. But when one arrives at this point the
                        mind becomes delirious. All genius is raving mad if it comes to that;
                        but Beethovens madness concentrated itself in himself, and imagined
                        things for his own enjoyment. The genius of many contemporary German
                        artists is an aggressive thing, and is characterised by its destructive
                        antagonism. The idealist who \x22possesses the world\x22 is liable to
                        dizziness. He was made to rule over an interior world. The splendour of
                        the exterior images that he is called upon to govern dazzles him; and,
                        like Caesar, he goes astray. Germany had hardly attained the position of
                        empire of the world when she found Nietzsches voice and that of the
                        deluded artists of the _Deutsches Theater_ and the _Secession_. Now
                        there is the grandiose music of Richard Strauss.
                        In the _Third Symphony_, known as _Ein Sommermorgentraum_ (\x22A Summer
                        Mornings Dream\x22), the first and the last parts are for the orchestra
                        alone; the fourth part contains some of the best of Mahlers music, and
                        is an admirable setting of Nietzsches words:
                        \x22The hero of the evening was unquestionably Mr. Grieg, the heroine
                        being Madame Grieg, who sang in her own unique and most artistic
                        fashion, a selection of her husbands songs, he accompanying with
                        great delicacy and poetic feeling. Grieg is so popular in London, both
                        as composer and pianist, that when he gave his last concert, people
                        were waiting in the street before the doors from eleven in the
                        morning, quite as in the old Rubinstein days.\x22"

                        of a family of ardent musicians, who devoted themselves to his

                        of _Don Juan_;[114] as a little boy
                        From the rocky heights on which their town was built, the people
                        of Palestrina could look across the Campagna--the great plain
                        between--and see the walls and towers of Rome. At the time of our
                        story, Saint Peters had withstood the sack of the city, which
                        happened a dozen years before, and Bramantes vast basilica had
                        already begun to rise. The artistic life of Rome was still at high
                        tide, for Raphael had passed away but twenty years before, and Michael
                        Angelo was at work on his Last Judgment."

                        artlessly in the unknown man; they love each other though they do not
                        admit it. The Stranger tries to repress his feelings; for Vita is young
                        and already affianced, and he thinks that he has no right to claim her.
                        But Vita, offended by his coldness, seeks to wound him, and succeeds.
                        In the end he betrays himself. \x22Yes, he loves her, and she knew it well.
                        But now that he has told her so, he will never see her again; and he
                        bids her good-bye.\x22
                        And now Verdi fell in love with the beautiful Margherita, the oldest
                        daughter of Barezzi, who did not mind giving his daughter to a poor
                        young man, for Verdi possessed something worth far more than money,
                        and that was great musical talent. The young people were married in
                        1836, and the whole Philharmonic Society attended.
                        Koussevitzky and his players starved for weeks on end. The boss
                        conducted in mittens. The men wore mittens, too, but they had holes in
                        them, so they could finger the strings and keys of their instruments."

                        healthy, normal man--a son of nature. He began to compose the music of

  communication_note: "The general public were not really interested in the art of the old
                        musicians until the _Association des Chanteurs de Saint-Gervais_ was
                        founded in 1892 by Charles Bordes, the choirmaster of the church of
                        Saint-Gervais. The immediate success and the noisy renown of the Society
                        were due to other things besides the talent of its conductor, who
                        combined with a lively artistic intelligence both common-sense and
                        energy and a remarkable gift for organisation--it was due partly to the
                        help of favourable circumstances, partly to the surfeit of Wagnerism, of
                        which I have just spoken, and partly to the birth of a new religious
                        art, which had sprung up since the death of Cesar Franck round the
                        memory of that great musician.
                        He went again the next year to London, but the state of his health
                        prevented his going anywhere else. For a malady, which finally proved
                        fatal, seemed to attack the composer when in his prime, and eventually
                        put an end to his work. We cannot guess what other art works he might
                        have created. But there must be some that have not yet seen the light.
                        It is known that he was wont to keep a composition for some time in
                        his desk, correcting and letting it ripen, until he felt it was ready
                        to be brought out."

  communication_note: "Do you remember Goethes ballad of _Der Zauberlehrling_ (_LApprenti
                        Sorcier_) which Dukas so cleverly made into music? There, in the absence
                        of his master, an apprentice set working some magic spells, and so
                        opened sluice-gates that no one could shut; and the house was flooded.
                        But it is quite another affair with the Opera-Comique. This theatre has
                        taken a very active part in the development of modern music. Without
                        renouncing its classic traditions, or its delightful repertory of the
                        old _opera-comiques_, it has had understanding enough, under the
                        judicious management of M. Albert Carre, to hold itself open for any
                        interesting productions in dramatic music. It takes no side among the
                        different schools; and the representatives of the old-fashioned light
                        opera with their songs elbow the leaders of the advanced school. No
                        association has done more important work, among musical dramas as well
                        as musical comedies, during the last twenty years. In this theatre,
                        which produced _Carmen_ in 1875, _Manon_ in 1884, and the _Roi dYs_ in
                        1888, were played the principal dramas of M. Bruneau, as well as M.
                        Charpentiers _Louise_, M. Debussys _Pelleas et Melisande_, and M.
                        Dukass _Ariane et Barbebleue_. It may seem astonishing that such works
                        should have found a place at the Opera-Comique and not at the Opera. But
                        if two musical theatres of different kinds exist, one of which pretends
                        to have the monopoly of great art, while the other with a simpler and
                        more intimate character seeks only to please, it is always the latter
                        that has a better chance of development and of making new discoveries;
                        for the first is oppressed by traditions that become ever stiffer and
                        more pedantic, while the other with its simplicity and lack of
                        pretension is able to accommodate itself to any manner of life. How many
                        artists have revolutionised their times while they were merely looked
                        upon as people who amused! Frescobaldi and Philipp Emanuel Bach brought
                        fresh life to art, but were scorned by the so-called representatives of
                        fine art; Mozarts _opere buffe_ have more of truth and life in them
                        than his _opere serie_; and there is as much dramatic power in an
                        _opera-comique_ like _Carmen_ as in all the repertory of grand Opera
                        to-day. And so the Opera-Comique theatre has become the home of the
                        boldest experiments in musical drama. The most daring or the most
                        violent ventures into musical realism, after the manner of Charpentier
                        or Bruneau, and the subtle fantasies of a delicate art of dreams, like
                        that of Debussy, have found a welcome there. It has also been open to
                        various kinds of foreign art: Humperdincks _Haensel und Gretel_, Verdis
                        _Falstaff_, the works of Puccini, Mascagni, and the young Italian
                        school, Richard Strausss _Feuersnot_, Rimsky-Korsakows
                        _Snegourotchka_, have all been played. And they have even given the
                        classic masterpieces of opera there: _Fidelio_, _Orfeo_, _Alceste_, the
                        two _Iphigenies_; and taken more pains with them and mounted them with
                        more pious zeal than they do at the Opera. The operas themselves are
                        more at home there, too, for the size of the theatre is more like that
                        of the eighteenth-century theatres. It is true that the stage rather
                        lacks depth; but the ingenuity of the director and the admirable scenic
                        artists he employs has succeeded in making one forget this defect, and
                        accomplished marvels. No theatre in Paris has more artistic staging, and
                        some of the scenery that has been designed lately is a masterpiece of
                        its kind. The Opera-Comique has also the advantage of excellent
                        conductors, and one of them, M. Messager, who is now Director, has, by
                        his clever interpretations, greatly contributed to the success of the
                        works of the new school."

  communication_note: "His most characteristic mental trait seems to be a languid melancholy,
                        which has its source in a rather bitter feeling of the futility of
                        life;[129] and this is accompanied by fits of weariness which are not
                        altogether healthy, followed by capricious moods and nervous gaiety, and
                        a freakish liking for burlesque and mimicry. It is his eager, restless
                        spirit that makes him rush about the world writing Breton and Auvergnian
                        rhapsodies, Persian songs, Algerian suites, Portuguese barcarolles,
                        Danish, Russian, or Arabian caprices, souvenirs of Italy, African

                        and seventeenth centuries, and preludes and fugues of the eighteenth.

                        of the people he meets, but gleans all he can, and then reproduces it
                        with a French complexion--after the manner of Montaigne in Italy, who
                        compared Verona to Poitiers, and Padua to Bordeaux, and who, when he was

                        cheerful fire and warm bread and milk were luxuries to the starving
                        lad. Best of all was it to curl up on the floor, beside the dying
                        embers and fall into refreshing slumber. The next morning the world
                        looked brighter. He had made up his mind not to try and see his
                        brother; he would support himself by music. He did not know just how
                        he was going to do this, but determined to fight for it _and never
                        give in_.
                        Nowhere is Wagner nearer to Beethoven than in _Siegfried_. In _Die
                        Walkuere_ certain characters, certain phrases of Wotan, of Bruennhilde,
                        and, especially, of Siegmund, bear a close relationship to Beethovens
                        symphonies and sonatas. I can never play the recitative _con espressione
                        e semplice_ of the seventeenth sonata for the piano (Op. 31, No. 2)
                        without being reminded of the forests of _Die Walkuere_ and the fugitive
                        hero. But in _Siegfried_ I find, not only a likeness to Beethoven in
                        details, but the same spirit running through the work--both the poem and
                        the music. I cannot help thinking that Beethoven would perhaps have
                        disliked _Tristan_, but would have loved _Siegfried_; for the latter is
                        a perfect incarnation of the spirit of old Germany, virginal and gross,
                        sincere and malicious, full of humour and sentiment, of deep feeling, of
                        dreams of bloody and joyous battles, of the shade of great oak-trees and
                        the song of birds.
                        It was evening and father Liszt, after the labors of the day were
                        over, could call these precious hours his own. He was now at the old
                        piano, for with him music was a passion. He used all his leisure time
                        for study and had some knowledge of most instruments. He had taught
                        himself the piano, indeed under the circumstances had become quite
                        proficient on it. To-night he was playing something of Haydn, for he
                        greatly venerated that master. Adam Liszt made a striking figure as
                        he sat there, his fine head, with its mass of light hair, thrown back,
                        his stern features softened by the music he was making.
                        His devotion and his faith have not been in vain. The name of M. dIndy
                        will be associated in history, not only with fine works, but with great
                        works: with the _Societe Nationale de Musique_, of which he is
                        president; with the _Schola Cantorum_, which he founded with Charles
                        Bordes, and which he directs; with the young French school of music, a
                        group of skilful artists and innovators, to whom he is a kind of elder
                        brother, giving them encouragement by his example and helping them
                        through the first hard years of struggle; and, lastly, with an awakening
                        of music in Europe, with a movement which, after the death of Wagner and
                        Franck, attracted the interest of the world by its revival of the art of
                        the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. M. dIndy has been the chief
                        representative of all this artistic evolution in France. By his deeds,
                        by his example, and by his spirit, he was among the first to stir up
                        interest in the musical education of France to-day. He has done more
                        for the advancement of our music than the entire official teaching of
                        the Conservatoires A day will come when, by the force of things and in
                        spite of all resistance, such a man will take the place that belongs to
                        him at the head of the organisation of music in France."

  communication_note: "What was to be done? His family was ruined, for a fire had demolished
                        their little possessions. He felt the silent reproaches of his father
                        already weighing upon him--for he loved his father dearly, and
                        remembered the sacrifices he had made for him. He did not wish to return
                        to his own province; indeed he could not return--that would have been
                        death. It was necessary that this boy of seventeen should find some
                        means of earning a livelihood and be able to instruct himself at the
                        same time. After his expulsion from the Conservatoire he attended no
                        other school; he taught himself. And he taught himself wonderfully; but
                        at what a cost! The suffering he went through from that time until he
                        was thirty, the enormous amount of energy he had to expend in order to
                        live and cultivate the fine spirit of poetry that was within him--all
                        this effort and toil was, without doubt, the cause of his unhappy death.
                        He had a burning thirst for knowledge and a fever for work which made
                        him sometimes forget the necessity for eating and drinking.
                        Wolf and Wagner did not see each other again. But Wolf fought
                        unceasingly on Wagners behalf. He went several times to Bayreuth,
                        though he had no personal intercourse with the Wagner family; but he met
                        Liszt, who, with his usual goodness, wrote him a kind letter about a
                        composition that he had sent him, and showed him what alterations to
                        make in it.
                        Such people are destined to unhappiness; and if they make other people
                        suffer, one may be sure that it is only half of what they suffer
                        themselves. They have a peculiar gift for attracting and gathering up
                        trouble; they savour sorrow like wine, and do not lose a drop of it.
                        Life seemed desirous that Berlioz should be steeped in suffering; and
                        his misfortunes were so real that it would be unnecessary to add to them
                        any exaggerations that history has handed down to us.
                        His compositions were heard in the best musical circles in Vienna, and
                        the future was bright with promise. A wealthy music patron persuaded
                        him to write a string quartet, the first of many to follow. Through
                        this man he received, in 1759, an appointment of music director to a
                        rich Bohemian, Count Morzin, who had a small orchestra at his country
                        seat. In the same year the first Symphony was composed."

  communication_note: "The work of the early period shows Debussy developing freely and
                        naturally. The independence of his thinking is unmistakable, but it
                        does not run into wilfulness. There is no violent break with the past,
                        but simply the quickening of certain French qualities by the infusion
                        of a new personality. It seemed as if a new and charming miniaturist
                        had appeared, who was doing both for piano and song what had never
                        been done before. The style of the two Arabesques and the more
                        successful of the Ariettes oubliees is perfect. A liberator seemed to
                        have come into music, to take up, half a century later, the work of
                        Chopin--the work of redeeming the art from the excessive objectivity
                        of German thought, of giving it not only a new soul but a new body,
                        swift, lithe and graceful. And that this exquisitely clear, pellucid
                        style could be made to carry out not only gaiety and whimsicality but
                        emotion of a deeper sort, is proved by the lovely \x22Clair de Lune.\x22
                        The composer of _Heldenleben_ is no longer unknown to Parisians. Every
                        year at Colonnes or Chevillards we see his tall, thin silhouette
                        reappear in the conductors desk. There he is with his abrupt and
                        imperious gestures, his wan and anxious face, his wonderfully clear
                        eyes, restless and penetrating at the same time, his mouth shaped like a
                        childs, a moustache so fair that it is nearly white, and curly hair
                        growing like a crown above his high round forehead.
                        Before Franz was six, as we have seen, he had already begun his
                        musical studies. If not sitting at the piano, he would scribble
                        notes--for he had learned without instruction how to write them long
                        before he knew the letters of the alphabet, or rudiments of writing.
                        His small hands were a source of trouble to him, and he resorted to
                        all kinds of comical expedients, such as sometimes playing extra notes
                        with the tip of his nose. Indeed his ingenuity knew no bounds, when it
                        came to mastering some musical difficulty."

                        kept on a stand a few feet from the Maestro. From time to time he

                        The nature of Paris is so complex and unstable that one feels it is
                        presumptuous to try to define it. It is a city so highly-strung, so
                        ingrained with fickleness, and so changeable in its tastes, that a book
                        that truly describes it at the moment it is written is no longer
                        accurate by the time it is published. And then, there is not only one
                        Paris; there are two or three Parises--fashionable Paris, middle-class
                        Paris, intellectual Paris, vulgar Paris--all living side by side, but
                        intermingling very little. If you do not know the little towns within
                        the great Town, you cannot know the strong and often inconsistent life
                        of this great organism as a whole."

  communication_note: "\x22The next scene represented a forest. Wotan was waking up the
                        dragon. At first the dragon said, I want to go to sleep; but
                        eventually he came out of his grotto. The dragon was represented by
                        two men clothed in a green skin with some scales stuck about it. At
                        one end of the skin they wagged a tail, and at the other end they
                        opened a crocodiles mouth, out of which came fire. The dragon,
                        which ought to have been a frightful beast--and perhaps he would
                        have frightened children about five years old--said a few words in
                        a bass voice. It was so childish and feeble that one was astonished
                        to see grown-up people present; even thousands of so-called
                        cultured people looked on and listened attentively, and went into
                        raptures. Then Siegfried arrived with his horn. He lay down during
                        a pause, which is reputed to be very beautiful; and sometimes he
                        talked to himself, and sometimes he was quite silent. He wanted to
                        imitate the song of the birds, and cut a rush with his horn, and
                        made a flute out of it. But he played the flute badly, and so he
                        began to blow his horn. The scene is intolerable, and there is not
                        the least trace of music in it. I was annoyed to see three thousand
                        people round about me, listening submissively to this absurdity
                        and dutifully admiring it.
                        [Footnote 164: Act III, scene 3. The power of that evocation is so
                        strong that it carries the poet along with it. It would seem that part
                        of the action had only been conceived with a view to the final effect of
                        the sudden colouring of the waves.]
                        He had a great admiration for Goethe, and was infatuated by Heinrich von
                        Kleist, whom he rather resembles both in his gifts and in his life; he
                        was an enthusiast about Grillparzer and Hebbel at a time when they were
                        but little appreciated; and he was one of the first Germans to discover
                        the worth of Moerike, whom, later on, he made popular in Germany. Besides
                        this, he read English and French writers. He liked Rabelais, and was
                        very partial to Claude Tillier, the French novelist of the provinces,
                        whose _Oncle Benjamin_ has given pleasure to so many German provincial
                        families, by bringing before them, as Wolf said, the vision of their own
                        little world, and helping them by his own jovial good humour to bear
                        their troubles with a smiling face. And so little Wolf, with hardly
                        enough to eat, found the means of learning both French and English, in
                        order better to appreciate the thoughts of foreign artists.

                        conductor invaded New York. Their Tuesday night concerts at Carnegie
                        Hall became the rage. The uninhibited music lovers of this town not

                        frenzied approval. He never lectured THEM.
                        A publisher of music, Georges Hartmann, feeling the forces that were
                        drawing together in French art, gathered about him the greater part of
                        the talented men of the young school--Franck, Bizet, Saint-Saens,
                        Massenet, Delibes, Lalo, A. de Castillon, Th. Dubois, Guiraud, Godard,
                        Paladilhe, and Joncieres--and undertook to produce their works in
                        public. He rented the Odeon theatre, and got together an orchestra, the
                        conductorship of which he entrusted to M. Edouard Colonne. And on 2
                        March, 1873, the _Concert National_ was inaugurated in a musical
                        matinee, where M. Saint-Saens played his _Concerto in G minor_ and Mme.
                        Viardot sang Schuberts _Roi des Aulnes_. In the first year six ordinary
                        concerts were given, and, besides that, two sacred concerts with choirs,
                        at which Cesar Francks _Redemption_ and Massenets _Marie-Magdeleine_
                        were performed. In 1874 the Odeon was abandoned for the Chatelet. This
                        venture attracted some attention, and the concerts were patronised by
                        the public; but the financial results were not great.[216] Hartmann was
                        discouraged and wished to give the whole thing up. But M. Edouard
                        Colonne conceived the idea of turning his orchestra into a society, and
                        of continuing the work under the name of _Association Artistique_. Among
                        the artist-founders were MM. Bruneau, Benjamin Godard, and Paul
                        Hillemacher. Its early days were full of struggle; but owing to the
                        perseverance of the Association all obstacles were finally overcome. In
                        1903 a festival was held to celebrate its thirtieth anniversary. During
                        these thirty years it had given more than eight hundred concerts, and
                        had performed the works of about three hundred composers, of which half
                        were French. The four composers most frequently heard at the Chatelet
                        were Saint-Saens, Wagner, Beethoven, and Berlioz.[217]"

                        would set off the other. He set to work, and soon became so absorbed
                        in this interweaving of melodies that the improvisation extended to
                        unaccustomed lengths, which bewildered the examiners and they decided
                        to award nothing to such a tiresome boy. Benoist, teacher of this
                        ingenious pupil, explained matters with the result that Cesar was
                        awarded a second prize for organ."

                        When the Conservatoire examinations of 1827, came on, Hector tried
                        again, and this time passed the preliminary test. The task set for
                        the general competition was to write music for Orpheus torn by the

                        Conservatoire, voted against the aspirant, and he was thrown out a

                        at Leipsic, attended by crowds of musicians and students, one of the

                        Now followed years of a busy musical life. Brahms made his
                        headquarters in Vienna, and while there did much composing. The
                        wonderful Piano Quintette, one of his greatest works, the German
                        Requiem, the Cantata Rinaldo and many beautiful songs came into being
                        during this period. Every little while concert tours and musical
                        journeys were undertaken, where Brahms often combined with other
                        artists in giving performances of his compositions. A series of three
                        concerts in Vienna in February and March, 1869, given by Brahms and
                        Stockhausen, were phenomenally successful, the tickets being sold
                        as soon as the concerts were announced. The same series was given in
                        Budapest with equal success.
                        Mozarts happy nature was jubilant over the journey. He watched
                        eagerly the peasants as they danced on the vine-clad terraces,
                        overlooking the deep blue lakes,--or listened as they sang at their
                        work in the sunny fields. He gazed at the wonderful processions of
                        priests through narrow streets of the towns, but above all there was
                        the grand music in the cathedrals."

                        dreamed he was destined to become a great musician. He married in
                        1548, when he was about twenty-two. If he had wished to secure one of
                        the great musical appointments in Rome, it was a very unwise thing for
                        him to marry, for single singers were preferred in nine cases out of
                        ten. Palestrina did not seem to realize this danger to a brilliant
                        career, and took his bride, Lucrezia, for pure love. She seems to have
                        been a person after his own heart, besides having a comfortable dowry
                        of her own. They had a happy union, which lasted for more than thirty
                        years.

                        dinner. Coming suddenly into the living-room, they found the tiny elf
                        busily writing at his fathers desk.
                        On the way to Paris, concerts were given in various cities. In Munich

                        But whatever may be the educational value of the theatre and concerts,
                        they are not complete enough in themselves for the people. To make their

                        Bachs prospects were now so much improved that he thought he might
                        make a home for himself. He had fallen in love with a cousin, Maria

                        Jakob Brahms, who as we have seen was in very poor circumstances, was
                        ready to exploit Hannes gift whenever occasion offered. He had the

  communication_note: "Already, as a young man, symptoms of deafness began to appear, and
                        the fear of becoming a victim of this malady made the composer more
                        sensitive than ever. He was not yet thirty when this happened, and
                        believing his life work at an end, he became deeply depressed. Various
                        treatments were tried for increasing deafness; at one time it seemed
                        to be cured by the skill of Dr. Schmidt, to whom out of gratitude he
                        dedicated his Septet, arranged as a Trio. By his advice the composer
                        went for the summer of 1820 to the little village of Heiligenstadt
                        (which means Holy City) in the hope that the calm, sweet environment
                        would act as a balm to his troubled mind. During this period of rest
                        and quiet his health improved somewhat, but from now on he had to give

                        Thus in twelve years, or at the age of twenty-two, the young
                        musician was thoroughly furnished for a career. He had worked through
                        carefully, from the beginning to the top, with thoroughness and
                        completeness, gaining his honors, slowly, step by step. All this
                        painstaking care, this overcoming of the technical difficulties of his
                        art, is what gave him such complete command and freedom in using the
                        medium of tone and harmony, in his unique manner.
                        But the Wagners, alas, were starving in Paris. One of Richards
                        articles at this time was called \x22The End of a Musician in Paris,\x22
                        and he makes the poor musician die with the words; \x22I believe in
                        God--Mozart and Beethoven.\x22 It was almost as bad as this for Wagner
                        himself. He determined to turn his back on all the intrigues and
                        hardships he had endured for over two years, and set out for the
                        homeland, which seemed the only desirable spot on earth.
                        The story of Chopins attraction for Marie Wodzinski and his reported
                        engagement to her, is soon told. During his visit in Dresden, after
                        leaving his parents in Carlsbad, he saw much of his old friends, Count
                        Wodzinski and his family. The daughter, Marie, aged nineteen, was
                        tall and slender, not beautiful but charming, with soft dark hair and
                        soulful eyes. Chopin spent all his evenings at their home and saw much
                        of Marie. The last evening the girl gave him a rose, and he composed a
                        valse for her."

                        acquaintance, which resulted in the musicians introduction to the
                        poets favorite pupil, Marianne Martinez. Also through Metastasio,
                        Haydn met Nicolo Porpora, an eminent teacher of singing and

                        persons. A manager of one of the principal theaters in Vienna, Felix
                        Kurz, had recently married a beautiful woman, whose loveliness was
                        much talked of. It occurred to Haydn to take a couple of companions
                        along and serenade the lady, playing some of his own music. Soon after
                        they had begun to play the house door opened and Kurz himself stood

                        playing?\x22 he asked. \x22My own,\x22 was the answer. \x22Indeed; then just step
                        inside.\x22 The three entered, wondering. They were presented to Madame,
                        then were given refreshments. \x22Come and see me to-morrow,\x22 said Kurz
                        when the boys left; \x22I think I have some work for you.\x22

                        has not capitulated. Not many years ago he wrote to a German journalist:
                        \x22I take very little notice of either praise or censure, not because I
                        have an exalted idea of my own merits (which would be foolish), but
                        because in doing my work, and fulfilling the function of my nature, as
                        an apple-tree grows apples, I have no need to trouble myself with other
                        peoples views.\x22[113]
                        In the spring of 1834 Chopin had been persuaded by Ferdinand Hiller
                        to accompany him to Aix-la-Chapelle, to attend the Lower Rhine Music
                        Festival. Before they started Chopin found he had not the money to go,
                        as it had been spent or given to some needy countryman. Hiller did not
                        like to go alone, and asked if his friend could think of no way out of
                        the dilemma. At last Chopin took the manuscript of the E flat Valse,
                        Op. 18, went with it to Pleyel the publisher, and returned with five
                        hundred francs. They could now go and enjoy the trip they had planned.
                        \x22When ones hair is white one must leave dreams--even those of
                        friendship.... Of what use is it to form ties which, though they
                        hold to-day, may break to-morrow?\x22
                        The boy Felix had a wonderful gift for making friends. One day he
                        suddenly caught sight of Carl Maria von Weber walking along the
                        streets of Berlin, near his home. He recognized the famous composer at
                        once, as he had lately visited his parents. The boys dark eyes glowed
                        with pleasure at the recognition, and tossing back his curls, he
                        sprang forward and threw his arms about Webers neck, begging him to
                        go home with him. When the astonished musician recovered himself, he
                        presented the boy to Jules Benedict, his young friend and pupil who
                        walked at his side, saying, \x22This is Felix Mendelssohn.\x22 For response
                        Felix, with a bright look, seized the young mans hand in both his
                        own. Weber stood by smiling at the boys enthusiasm. Again Felix
                        besought them to come home with him, but Weber had to attend a
                        rehearsal. \x22Is it for the opera?\x22 the boy cried excitedly."

                        Berlioz was the first to be astonished when he heard them for the first

                        fell sobbing on the kettledrums. At the performance of his _Tuba mirum_,

                        of its nervous brilliance and dreaming poetry. Above all, Weber is much
                        more mundane and more of a classicist; he lacks Berliozs revolutionary
                        passion and plebeian force; he is less expressive and less grand.
                        That page makes one shudder. Suicide is less distressing. Neither

                        on a like occasion? He would have written the symphony without
                        doubt--and he would have been right. But poor Berlioz, who was weak
                        enough to sacrifice his duty to love, was, alas! also heroic enough to
                        sacrifice his genius to duty.[24]
                        In 1723, his opera \x22Ottone\x22 was to be produced. The great singer
                        Cuzzoni had been engaged, but the capricious lady did not arrive in
                        England till the rehearsals were far advanced, which of course did not
                        please the composer. When she did appear she refused to sing the aria
                        as he had composed it. He flew into a rage, took her by the arm and
                        threatened to throw her out of the window unless she obeyed. The
                        singer was so frightened by his anger that she sang as he directed,
                        and made a great success of the aria."

  communication_note: "It seems however, that the Sistine singers resented the appointment
                        of a new member, and complained about it. Several changes in the Papal
                        chair occurred at this time, and when Paul IV, as Pope, came into
                        power, he began at once with reforms. Finding that Palestrina and two
                        other singers were married men, he put all three out, though granting
                        an annuity of six scudi a month for each.
                        But one must forget this unwise programme, which borders on bad taste
                        and at times on something even worse. When one has succeeded in
                        forgetting it one discovers a well-proportioned symphony in four
                        parts--Allegro, Scherzo, Adagio, and Finale in fugue form--and one of
                        the finest works in contemporary music. It has the passionate
                        exuberance of Strausss preceding symphony, _Heldenleben_, but it is
                        superior in artistic construction; one may even say that it is Strausss
                        most perfect work since _Tod und Verklaerung_ (\x22Death and
                        Transfiguration\x22), with a richness of colouring and technical skill that
                        _Tod und Verklaerung_ did not possess. One is dazzled by the beauty of an
                        orchestration which is light and pliant, and capable of expressing
                        delicate shades of feeling; and this struck me the more after the solid
                        massiveness of Mahlers orchestration, which is like heavy unleavened
                        bread. With Strauss everything is full of life and sinew, and there is
                        nothing wasted. Possibly the first setting-out of his themes has rather
                        too schematic a character; and perhaps the melodic utterance is rather
                        restricted and not very lofty; but it is very personal, and one finds it
                        impossible to disassociate his personality from these vigorous themes
                        that burn with youthful ardour, and cut the air like arrows, and twist
                        themselves in freakish arabesques. In the adagio depicting night, there
                        is, though in very bad taste, much seriousness and reverie and stirring
                        emotion. The fugue at the end is of astonishing sprightliness; and is a
                        mixture of colossal jesting and heroic pastoral poetry worthy of
                        Beethoven, whose style it recalls in the breadth of its development. The
                        final apotheosis is filled with life; its joy makes the heart beat. The
                        most extravagant harmonic effects and the most abominable discords are
                        softened and almost disappear in the wonderful combination of _timbres_.
                        It is the work of a strong and sensual artist, the true heir of the
                        Wagner of the _Meistersinger_.

                        Adversaries, The Heros Companion, The Field of Battle, The Peaceful
                        Labours of the Hero, The Heros Retirement from the World, and the
                        Achievement of His Ideal. It is an extraordinary work, drunken with
                        heroism, colossal, half barbaric, trivial, and sublime. An Homeric hero
                        struggles among the sneers of a stupid crowd, a herd of brawling and
                        hobbling ninnies. A violin solo, in a sort of concerto, describes the
                        seductions, the coquetry, and the degraded wickedness of woman. Then
                        strident trumpet-blasts sound the attack; and it is beyond me to give an
                        idea of the terrible charge of cavalry that follows, which makes the
                        earth tremble and our hearts leap; nor can I describe how an iron
                        determination leads to the storming of towns, and all the tumultuous din
                        and uproar of battle--the most splendid battle that has ever been
                        painted in music. At its first performance in Germany I saw people
                        tremble as they listened to it, and some rose up suddenly and made
                        violent gestures quite unconsciously. I myself had a strange feeling of
                        giddiness, as if an ocean had been upheaved, and I thought that for the
                        first time for thirty years Germany had found a poet of Victory.

  communication_subject: "The young enthusiast began life anew in Paris, by being very economical, as he must pay back the loan made for his mass."
  communication_note: "At length, as a result of these individual efforts, the State began to
                        show an interest in this educational movement, although it had for so
                        long stood apart from it.[251] It discovered, in its turn, the
                        educational value of singing. A musical test was instituted at the
                        examination for the _Brevet superieur_[252] which made the study of
                        solfeggio a more serious matter in the Ecoles Normales. In 1903 an
                        endeavour was made to organise the teaching of music in the schools and
                        colleges in a more rational way.[253]
                        Before starting on the trip to Italy just mentioned, he felt that a
                        decision must be reached about his music. It had become as the breath
                        of life to him. He wrote his mother and laid bare his heart to her.
                        \x22My whole life has been a twenty years struggle between poetry and
                        prose, or let us say--between music and law. If I follow my own bent,
                        it points, as I believe correctly, to music. Write yourself to Wieck
                        at Leipsic and ask him frankly what he thinks of me and my plan. Beg
                        him to answer at once and decisively.\x22 The letter was duly written to
                        Wieck, who decided in favor of Robert and his plans.
                        By the next year Schumann had suffered a deep sorrow in the loss of
                        his mother, and also his love for Ernestine began to cool, until the
                        partial bond was amicably dissolved. Meanwhile his affection for
                        Clara Wieck, who was just budding into womanhood, began to ripen into
                        devoted love. This, too, was the beginning of the long struggle for
                        the possession of his beloved, since the father had opposed such a
                        connection from beginning to end. Schumann wrote a friend in 1839:
                        \x22Truly from the struggle Clara has cost me, much music has been caused
                        and created; the Concerto, Sonatas, Davidsbendler Dances, Kreisleriana
                        and Novellettes are the result.\x22 Beyond the compositions just
                        mentioned, he relieved his oppressed heart by a composition rich in
                        meaning--nothing less than the great Fantaisie, Op. 17. He meant to
                        contribute the profits from its sale to the fund for the erection of a
                        monument to Beethoven. The titles to the three movements were \x22Ruins,\x22
                        \x22Triumphal Arch,\x22 \x22Starry Crown.\x22 He afterwards gave up the whole
                        idea, and dedicated the work to Franz Liszt."

                        \x22But it is a very curious thing that all other writers of our time
                        are like this. Balzac hated music. Hugo could not stand it. Even
                        Lamartine, who himself is like a piano to be hired or sold, holds
                        it in horror!\x22
                        \x22It was thus,\x22 he says,[68] \x22that I began to get familiar with the
                        use of the orchestra, and to know its expression and timbre, as
                        well as the range and mechanism of most of the instruments. By
                        carefully comparing the effect produced with the means used to
                        produce it, I learned the hidden bond which unites musical
                        expression to the special art of instrumentation; but no one put me
                        in the way of this. The study of the methods of the three modern
                        masters, Beethoven, Weber, and Spontini, the impartial examination
                        of the traditions of instrumentation and of little-used forms and
                        combinations, conversations with virtuosi, and the effects I made
                        them try on their different instruments, together with a little
                        instinct, did the rest for me.\x22[69]"

  communication_subject: "I have quoted this rather long passage to show how the impression made by one of Rameaus operas on his contemporaries resembled that made by Wagner on his enemies."
  communication_note: "In spite of appearances, Wagner is a classicist compared with Berlioz;
                        he carried on and perfected the work of the German classicists; he made
                        no innovations; he is the pinnacle and the close of one evolution of
                        art. Berlioz began a new art; and one finds in it all the daring and
                        gracious ardour of youth. The iron laws that bound the art of Wagner are
                        not to be found in Berliozs early works, which give one the illusion of
                        perfect freedom.[92]
                        How simple and modest was this great master, in face of his mighty
                        achievements! He wrote to a friend in 1824: \x22I feel as if I had
                        scarcely written more than a few notes.\x22 These later years had been
                        more than full of work and anxiety. Totally deaf, entirely thrown in
                        upon himself, often weak and ill, the master kept on creating work
                        after work of the highest beauty and grandeur.
                        A new generation was growing up, however,--a generation that was serious
                        and thoughtful, that was more attracted by pure music than by the
                        theatre, that was filled with a burning desire to found a national art.
                        To this generation M. Saint-Saens and M. Vincent dIndy belong. The war
                        of 1870 strengthened these ideas about music, and, while the war was
                        still raging, there sprang from them the _Societe Nationale de Musique_."

  communication_note: "The Overture was first to spring into being. When it was written
                        out, Felix and Fanny often played it as a duet. In this form the
                        composer-pianist Moscheles heard it and was impressed by its beauty.
                        The fascinating Scherzo and dreamy Nocturne followed. When all were
                        elaborated and perfected, the complete work was performed by the
                        garden house orchestra for a crowded audience, who abundantly
                        expressed their delight. Sir G. Macfarren has said of it: \x22No one
                        musical work contains so many points of harmony and orchestration that
                        are novel yet none of them have the air of experiment, but all seem to
                        have been written with a certainty of their success.\x22
                        The greatest work of Mendelssohns career was his oratorio of
                        \x22Elijah\x22 which had long grown in his mind, until it was on the eve
                        of completion in the spring of 1846. In a letter to the famous singer
                        Jenny Lind, an intimate friend, he writes: \x22I am jumping about my
                        room for joy. If my work turns out half as good as I fancy it is, how
                        pleased I shall be.\x22

  communication_note: "With all this music study and intercourse with musical friends there
                        was very little time left for the study of law. Yet he still kept
                        up appearances by attending the lectures, and had intended for some
                        months to enter the Heidelberg University. This decision was put into
                        execution in May 1829, when he started by coach for Heidelberg.
                        M. dIndy claims that this system may be applied as successfully to
                        instrumentalists and singers as to future composers. \x22For it is as
                        profitable for them to know,\x22 he says, \x22how to sing a liturgic monody
                        properly, or to be able to play a Corelli sonata in a suitable style, as
                        it is for composers to study the structure of a motet or a suite.\x22 M.
                        dIndy, moreover, obliged all students, without distinction, to attend
                        the lectures on vocal music; and, besides that, he instituted a special
                        class to teach the conducting of orchestras--which was something quite
                        new to France. His object, as he clearly said, was to give a new form to
                        modern music by means of a knowledge of the music of the past.
                        Edwards knowledge of French was very uncertain, and while he could
                        get along fairly well in the piano class, he had considerable trouble
                        in following the lessons in theory. He determined to make a special
                        study of the language, and a teacher was engaged to give him private
                        lessons."

  communication_note: "The new opera, \x22La Clemenza di Tito,\x22 was finished in time and
                        performed, but was received somewhat indifferently. Mozart returned to
                        Vienna with spirits depressed and body exhausted by overwork. However,
                        he braced himself anew, and on September 30th, the new fairy opera,
                        the \x22Magic Flute,\x22 was produced, and its success increased with each
                        performance.
                        The hopes Leopold Mozart had built on Wolfgangs success in Paris were
                        not to be realized. The enthusiasm he had aroused as a child prodigy
                        was not awarded to the matured musician. Three months passed away in
                        more or less fruitless endeavor. Then the mother, who had been his
                        constant companion in these trials and travels, fell seriously ill. On
                        July 3, 1778, she passed away in her sons arms.
                        This state continued for over two years, until his final release,
                        January 23, 1908, as he had just entered his forty-seventh year. The
                        old Westminster Hotel had been the MacDowell home through the long
                        illness. From here is but a step to St. Georges Episcopal Church,
                        where a simple service was held. On the following day the composer was
                        taken to Peterboro, his summer home, a spot destined to play its part,
                        due to the untiring efforts of Mrs. MacDowell, in the development of
                        music in America.
                        The orchestra men, too, learned to like him. They discovered that,
                        with all his public histrionics, he was on the level as a musician.
                        He is a merciless task master, but in rehearsals he gives himself no
                        airs. Dressed in an old pair of pants and a disreputable brown woolen
                        sweater, which he has worn in private since the day he landed in
                        Boston, he works like a stevedore. When he, the pants and the sweater
                        had been with the Symphony ten years, the men gave him a testimonial
                        dinner."

  communication_note: "A new director was now in charge of the Opera House. He conceived the
                        bright idea of setting the two composers at work on the same subject,
                        which was to be \x22Iphigenie en Tauride.\x22 This plan made great commotion
                        in the ranks of the rival factions, as each wished to have their
                        composers work performed first. The director promised that Piccinis
                        opera should be first placed in rehearsal. Gluck soon finished his
                        and handed it in, but the Italian, trusting to the directors word of
                        honor, was not troubled when he heard the news, though he determined
                        to complete his as soon as possible. A few days later, when he went to
                        the Opera House with his completed score, he was horrified to find the
                        work of his rival already in rehearsal. There was a lively scene, but
                        the manager said he had received orders to produce the work of Gluck
                        at once, and he must obey. On the 18th of May, 1779, the Gluck opera
                        was first performed. It produced the greatest excitement and had a
                        marvelous success. Even Piccini succumbed to the spell, for the music
                        made such an impression on him that he did not wish his own work to be
                        brought out.
                        \x22But it is a very curious thing that all other writers of our time
                        are like this. Balzac hated music. Hugo could not stand it. Even
                        Lamartine, who himself is like a piano to be hired or sold, holds
                        it in horror!\x22
                        From this shock he never seemed to rally, though at intervals for a
                        while, he still composed. His death occurred November 4, 1847. It
                        can be said of him that his was a beautiful life, in which \x22there was
                        nothing to tell that was not honorable to his memory and profitable to
                        all men.\x22"

  communication_note: "This has bolstered the popular notion--based on the fact that he
                        conducts from memory--that his sight is so poor as to amount almost to
                        blindness.
                        Natalya, the daughter of a wealthy merchant and a rich girl in her own
                        right, promised him anything he wanted for a wedding gift. \x22Give me a
                        symphony orchestra.\x22 was Koussevitzkys startling request. The bride
                        was taken aback, for it was with the bull fiddle that he had wooed and
                        won her and she hated to see him give it up, but she kept her word.
                        But it is especially by the manner in which they conceive the respective
                        relationships of poetry and music to opera that the two composers
                        differ. With Wagner, music is the kernel of the opera, the glowing
                        focus, the centre of attraction; it absorbs everything, and it stands
                        absolutely first. But that is not the French conception. The musical
                        stage, as we conceive it in France (if not what we actually possess),
                        should present such a combination of the arts as go to make an
                        harmonious whole. We demand that an equal balance shall be kept between
                        poetry and music; and if their equilibrium must be a little upset, we
                        should prefer that poetry was not the loser, as its utterance is more
                        conscious and rational. That was Glucks aim; and because he realised it
                        so well he gained a reputation among the French public which nothing
                        will destroy. Debussys strength lies in the methods by which he has
                        approached this ideal of musical temperateness and disinterestedness,
                        and in the way he has placed his genius as a composer at the service of
                        the drama. He has never sought to dominate Maeterlincks poem, or to
                        swallow it up in a torrent of music; he has made it so much a part of
                        himself that at the present time no Frenchman is able to think of a
                        passage in the play without Debussys music singing at the same time
                        within him."

                        brightest anticipations. On his arrival in Vienna he went at once to
                        Mozarts house. He was received most kindly and asked to play, but
                        Mozart seemed preoccupied and paid but little attention. Ludwig,
                        seeing this stopped playing and asked for a theme on which to
                        improvise. Mozart gave a simple theme, and Beethoven, taking the
                        slender thread, worked it up with so much feeling and power, that
                        Mozart, who was now all attention and astonishment, stepped into the
                        next room, where some friends were waiting for him, and said, \x22Pay

                        Europe in 1888. On his return to St. Petersburg he conducted a program
                        of his own compositions for the Philharmonic Society, which was
                        also successful, in spite of the intense nervousness which he always
                        suffered. As a result of his concert he received offers to conduct
                        concerts in Hamburg, Dresden, Leipsic, Vienna, Copenhagen and London,
                        many of which he accepted."

                        example. Berlioz says in his _Memoires_ (I, 229): \x22One day when Crispino
                        was lacking in respect I made-him a present of two shirts, a pair of
                        trousers, and three good kicks behind.\x22 In a note he added, \x22This is a

                        kicked Crispino.\x22 But Berlioz took care afterwards to omit this note.
                        One attaches as little importance to his other small boasts as to this
                        one. The errors in the _Memoires_ have been greatly exaggerated; and
                        besides, Berlioz is the first to warn his readers that he only wrote
                        what pleased him, and in his preface says that he is not writing his
                        Confessions. Can one blame him for that?]"

                        for the choir. \x22I can find you one at least,\x22 said the pastor; \x22he is
                        a scholar of Frankh, the schoolmaster, and has a sweet voice.\x22
                        Soon after this Count Borromes engaged Verdi to write a Cantata for
                        chorus and orchestra, to honor the occasion of a marriage in the
                        family. Verdi did so but was never paid a sou for his work. The next
                        request was from Masini, who urged Verdi to compose an opera for
                        the Teatro Filodramatico, where he was conductor. He handed him a
                        libretto, which with a few alterations here and there became \x22Oberto,
                        Conte di San Bonifacio.\x22 Verdi accepted the offer at once, and being
                        obliged to move to Busseto, where he had been appointed organist,
                        remained there nearly three years, during which time the opera was
                        completed. On returning to Milan he found Masini no longer conductor,
                        and lost all hope of seeing the new opera produced. After long waiting
                        however, the impressario sent for him, and promised to bring out the
                        work the next season, if the composer would make a few changes. Young
                        and as yet unknown, Verdi was quite willing. \x22Oberto\x22 was produced
                        with a fair amount of success, and repeated several times. On the
                        strength of this propitious beginning, the impressario, Merelli, made
                        the young composer an excellent offer--to write three operas, one
                        every eight months, to be performed either in Milan or in Vienna,
                        where he was impressario of both the principal theaters. He promised
                        to pay four thousand lire--about six hundred and seventy dollars--for
                        each, and share the profits of the copyright. To young Verdi this
                        seemed an excellent chance and he accepted at once. Rossi wrote a
                        libretto, entitled \x22Proscritto,\x22 and work on the music was about to
                        begin. In the spring of 1840, Merelli hurried from Vienna, saying he
                        needed a comic opera for the autumn season, and wanted work begun on
                        it at once. He produced three librettos, none of them very good. Verdi
                        did not like them, but since there was no time to lose, chose the
                        least offensive and set to work.
                        \x22Water,\x22 said the priest to the altar boy. Giuseppe, not hearing him,
                        the priest repeated the call. Still the child, who was listening to
                        the music, did not hear. \x22Water,\x22 said the priest a third time and
                        gave Giuseppe such a sharp kick that he fell down the steps of the
                        altar, hitting his head on the stone floor, and was taken unconscious
                        into the sacristy.
                        Theres also an anecdote to the effect that, much earlier, when Serge
                        was still a little boy in his small native town in the province of
                        Tver, in northern Russia, he would arrange the parlor chairs in rows
                        and, with some score open in front of him, conduct them. Once in
                        a while hed stop short and berate the chairs. Then little Serges
                        language was something awful."

  communication_note: "Leopold Mozart was distracted at news of this project. He at once
                        wrote, advising his son to go to Paris and try there to make a name
                        and fame for himself. The son dutifully yielded at once. With a heavy
                        heart he prepared to leave Mannheim, where he had spent such a happy
                        winter, and his love dream came to an end. It was a sad parting with
                        the Weber household, for they regarded Wolfgang as their greatest
                        benefactor.
                        While the aim has been to make the story-sketches interesting to
                        young people, the author hopes that they may prove valuable to musical
                        readers of all ages. Students of piano, violin or other instruments
                        need to know how the great composers lived their lives. In every
                        musical career described in this book, from the old masters
                        represented by Bach and Beethoven to the musical prophets of our own
                        day, there is a wealth of inspiration and practical guidance for the
                        artist in any field. Through their struggles, sorrows and triumphs,
                        divine melody and harmony came into being, which will bless the world
                        for all time to come.

  communication_subject: "The many letters which passed between Wagner and Liszt, which fill two large volumes, show how Liszt clearly recognized the brilliant genius of his friend, and stood ready to help him over financial difficulties, and how Wagner came to lean more and more on Liszts generosity."
  communication_note: "There were Victor Hugo. King of the romanticists, Heine, poet and
                        novelist; De Musset, Flaubert, Zola, Lamartine, Chateaubriand,
                        Baudelaire, Ary Scheffer, Merimee, Gautier, Berlioz, Balzac, Rossini,
                        Meyerbeer, Hiller, Nourrit, to mention a few. Liszt was there too, and
                        George Sand, Mendelssohn and Kalkbrenner. Chopin called on the last
                        named, who was considered the first pianist of the day, and played for
                        him. Kalkbrenner remarked he had the style of Cramer and the touch of
                        Field. He proposed that Chopin should study three years with him,
                        and he would then become a great virtuoso. Of course the young artist
                        might have learned something-on the mechanical side, but at the risk
                        of injuring the originality and style of his playing. His old friend
                        and teacher Elsner, kept him from doing this.
                        In the autumn of this year, Johann paid his third visit to Detmold,
                        and found himself socially as well as musically the fashion. It was
                        the correct thing to have lessons from him and his presence gave
                        distinction to any assemblage. But Johann did not wish to waste his
                        time at social functions; when obliged to be present at some of these
                        events he would remain silent the entire evening, or else say sharp
                        or biting things, making the hosts regret they had asked him. His
                        relations with the Court family, however, remained very pleasant.
                        Yet he began to chafe under the constant demands on his time, and the
                        rigid etiquette of the little Court. The next season he definitely
                        declined the invitation to revisit Detmold, the reason given was that
                        he had not the time, as he was supervising the publication of a number
                        of his works. Brahms had become interested in writing for the voice,
                        and had already composed any number of beautiful vocal solos and part
                        songs.
                        Richard Nordraak was a young Norwegian composer of great talent, who,
                        in his brief career, created a few excellent works. The two musicians
                        met in the winter of 1864 and were attracted to each other at once.
                        Nordraak visited Grieg in his home, where they discussed music and
                        patriotism to their hearts content. Nordraak was intensely patriotic,
                        and wished to see the establishment of Norse music. Grieg, who had
                        been more or less influenced by German ideas, since Leipsic days,
                        now cast off the fetters and placed himself on the side of Norwegian
                        music. To prove this he composed the Humoresken, Op. 6, and dedicated
                        them to Nordraak. From now on he felt free to do as he pleased in
                        music--to be himself."

  communication_note: "Johann had been doing some piano teaching when not occupied with
                        composition. But now, on the advice of his musical friends, he decided
                        to try his luck again as a concert pianist. He began by joining Frau
                        Clara and Joachim in a concert at Danzig. Each played solos. Johanns
                        were Bachs \x22Chromatic Fantaisie\x22 and several manuscript pieces of
                        his own. After this the young artist went his own way. He played with
                        success in Bremen, also in Hamburg. It is said he was always nervous
                        before playing, but especially so in his home city. However all passed
                        off well. He now settled definitely in Hamburg, making musical trips
                        to other places when necessary."

                        the one supreme achievement in the lyric drama. As one of his critics
                        writes: \x22The reading of the score of Pelleas and Melisande remains
                        for me one of the most marvelous lessons in French art: it would be

                        The music, which seems so complicated, is in reality very simple. It
                        sounds so shadowy and impalpable, but it is really built up with
                        as sure control as the most classic work. It is indeed music which
                        appeals to refined and sensitive temperaments.
                        Felix was at this time but little more than twelve years old. He had
                        within the last year composed fifty or sixty pieces, including a trio
                        for piano and strings, containing three movements, several sonatas for
                        the piano, some songs and a musical comedy in three scenes, for
                        piano and voices. All these were written with the greatest care and
                        precision, and with the date of each neatly added. He collected his
                        pieces into volumes; and the more work he did the more neatly he
                        wrote.
                        The playing began, when before long it was seen the boy was actually
                        playing the second violin part and doing it correctly. The second
                        violin ceased bowing in amazement and allowed Wolfgang to go on alone.
                        After this he was permitted to play all the second violin part of
                        the whole six pieces. Emboldened by this success, he volunteered
                        to attempt the first violin part, an offer which was greeted with
                        laughter; but nothing daunted, he took up his violin and began. There
                        were mistakes here and there, of course, but he persisted to the end,
                        to the astonishment of all.
                        [Footnote 250: Mention must especially be made of little groups of young
                        students, pupils of the Universities or the larger schools, who are

                        the people. Such an effort, made more than a year ago at Vaugirard,

                        from one church to another singing Gregorian and Palestrinian music.]"

                        libretto entitled \x22The Farmers Man.\x22 As he must keep constantly at
                        his teaching during the day, he devoted the greater part of the night
                        to composition. He worked so hard that the opera, begun in December
                        1851, was finished in two years, but he paid dearly for all this extra
                        labor. He fell ill--a state of nervous prostration--and was unable for
                        some time to compose at all.
                        All was not a life of sunshine for Palestrina, for he suffered many
                        domestic sorrows. His three promising sons died one after another.
                        They were talented young men, who might have followed in the footsteps
                        of their distinguished father. In 1580 his wife died also. Yet neither
                        poignant sorrow, worldly glory nor ascetic piety blighted his homely
                        affections. At the Jubilee of Pope Gregory XIII, in 1575, when 1500
                        pilgrims from the town of Palestrina descended the hills on the way
                        to Rome, it was their old townsman, Giovanni Pierluigi, who led their
                        songs, as they entered the Eternal City, their maidens clad in white
                        robes, and their young men bearing olive branches.
                        When Gluck arrived in Paris, he brought with him the finished opera of
                        \x22Armide,\x22 which was produced at the Paris Grand Opera on September
                        23, 1777. At first it was merely a _succes destime_, but soon became
                        immensely popular. On the first night many of the critics were against
                        the opera, which was called too noisy. The composer, however, felt he
                        had done some of his best work in \x22Armide\x22; that the music was written
                        in such style that it would not grow old, at least not for a long
                        time. He had taken the greatest pains in composing it, and declared
                        that if it were not properly rehearsed at the Opera he would not let
                        them have it at all, but would retain the work himself for his own
                        pleasure. He wrote to a friend: \x22I have put forth what little strength
                        is left in me, into Armide; I confess I should like to finish my
                        career with it.\x22
                        Nowhere is Wagner nearer to Beethoven than in _Siegfried_. In _Die
                        Walkuere_ certain characters, certain phrases of Wotan, of Bruennhilde,
                        and, especially, of Siegmund, bear a close relationship to Beethovens
                        symphonies and sonatas. I can never play the recitative _con espressione
                        e semplice_ of the seventeenth sonata for the piano (Op. 31, No. 2)
                        without being reminded of the forests of _Die Walkuere_ and the fugitive
                        hero. But in _Siegfried_ I find, not only a likeness to Beethoven in
                        details, but the same spirit running through the work--both the poem and
                        the music. I cannot help thinking that Beethoven would perhaps have
                        disliked _Tristan_, but would have loved _Siegfried_; for the latter is
                        a perfect incarnation of the spirit of old Germany, virginal and gross,
                        sincere and malicious, full of humour and sentiment, of deep feeling, of
                        dreams of bloody and joyous battles, of the shade of great oak-trees and
                        the song of birds."

  communication_note: "Without doubt, the enormous stage at the Opera does not lend itself well
                        to modern musical dramas, which are intimate and concentrated, and would
                        be lost in its immense space, which is more adapted for formal
                        processions like the marches in the _Prophete_ and _Aida_. Besides this,
                        there is the conventional acting of the majority of the singers, the
                        dull lifelessness of the choruses, the defective acoustics, and the
                        exaggerated utterance and gestures of the actors, demanded by the great
                        dimensions of the place--all of which is a serious obstacle to the
                        conception of a living and simple art. But the chief obstacle will
                        always lie in the very nature of such a theatre--a theatre of luxury and
                        vanity, created for a set of snobs, whose least interest is the music,
                        who have not enough intellect to create a fashion, but who servilely
                        follow every fashion after it is thirty years old. Such a theatre no
                        longer counts in the history of French music; and its next directors
                        will need a vast amount of ingenuity and energy to get a semblance of
                        life into such a dead colossus.
                        Poor Josef! He realized that his place was virtually taken by the
                        brother he had welcomed so joyously only a short time before. No one
                        was to blame of course; it was one of those things that could not be
                        avoided. But what actually caused him to leave St. Stephens was a
                        boyish prank played on one of the choir boys, who sat in front of
                        him. Taking up a new pair of shears lying near, he snipped off, in a
                        mischievous moment, the boys pigtail. For this jest he was punished
                        and then dismissed from the school. He could hardly realize it, in his
                        first dazed, angry condition. Not to enjoy the busy life any more, not
                        to see Michael and the others and have a comfortable home and sing
                        in the Cathedral. How he lived after that he hardly knew. But several
                        miserable days went by. One rainy night a young man whom he had known
                        before, came upon him near the Cathedral, and was struck by his
                        white, pinched face. He asked where the boy was living. \x22Nowhere--I am
                        starving,\x22 was the reply. Honest Franz Spangler was touched at once.
                        Before he was quite eleven years old, his father took him on a tour of
                        Belgium. It looked then as though he had started on a virtuoso career,
                        as the wonder children--Mozart, Chopin, Thalberg, Liszt and others who
                        had preceded him, had done. The future proved, however, that Cesars
                        life work was to be composing, teaching and organ playing, with a
                        quiet life, even in busy Paris, instead of touring the world to make
                        known his gifts."

  communication_note: "Franz Liszt passed away August 1, 1886, in the house of his friend,
                        Herr Frohlich, near Wagners Villa Wahnfried, Bayreuth, at the age of
                        seventy-five. As was his custom every summer, Liszt was in Bayreuth,
                        assisting in the production of Wagners masterpieces, when he
                        succumbed to pneumonia. Thus passed a great composer, a world famous
                        piano virtuoso, and a noble and kindly spirit.
                        His memory is, of course, phenomenal. Anything he has once seen,
                        read and particularly, heard, he not only remembers but is unable to
                        forget. The other day he and a friend were discussing the concerto
                        played by a certain pianist on his American debut in 1911. Mr.
                        Toscanini remembered it as Beethovens Fourth Piano Concerto; the
                        friend maintained it was the Second."

  communication_note: "At the period of musical history in which the gifted boy lived, a
                        musicians education was not complete unless he went to Italy, for
                        this country stood first as the home of music. Leopold Mozart had made
                        a couple of trips to Vienna with his children, the account of which
                        need not detain us here. He had decided that Wolfgang must go to
                        Italy, and breathe in the atmosphere of that land of song. And so in
                        December, 1769, father and son set out for the sunny south, with high
                        hopes for success.
                        Who does not feel the infectious warmth and beauty of these spirited
                        words? How this force of enthusiasm and sincerity must grip all young
                        and eager hearts. \x22There are two qualities,\x22 says M. dIndy, on the last
                        page of _Cours de Composition_, \x22which a master should try to encourage
                        and develop in the spirit of the pupil, for without them science is
                        useless; these qualities are an unselfish love of art and enthusiasm for
                        good work.\x22 And these two virtues radiate from M. dIndys personality
                        as they do from his writings; that is his power.
                        Haydn called next day and learned the manager had written a libretto
                        of a comic opera which he called \x22The Devil on two Sticks,\x22 and was
                        looking for some one to compose the music. In one place there was to
                        be a tempest at sea, and Haydn was asked how he would represent that.
                        As he had never seen the sea, he was at a loss how to express it. The
                        manager said he himself had never seen the ocean, but to his mind it
                        was like this, and he began to toss his arms wildly about. Haydn tried
                        every way he could think of to represent the ocean, but Kurz was not
                        satisfied. At last he flung his hands down with a crash on each end
                        of the keyboard and brought them together in the middle. \x22Thats it,
                        thats it,\x22 cried the manager and embraced the youth excitedly. All
                        went well with the rest of the opera. It was finished and produced,
                        but did not make much stir, a fact which was not displeasing to the
                        composer, as he was not proud of his first attempt.
                        Wolf never chose commonplace poems for his music--which is more than can
                        be said of Schubert or Schumann. He did not use anything written by
                        contemporary poets, although he was in sympathy with some of them, such
                        as Liliencron, who hoped very much to be translated into music by him.
                        But he could not do it; he could not use anything in the work of a great
                        poet unless he became so intimate with it that it seemed to be a part of
                        him."

                        its wonderful scenery stirred Mendelssohns poetic soul to the depths.
                        Yet, though his passionate love of nature was so impressed by the
                        great mountains, forests and waterfalls, it was the sea which he loved
                        best of all. As he approached Naples, and saw the sea sparkling in
                        the sun lighted bay, he exclaimed: \x22To me it is the finest object in
                        nature! I love it almost more than the sky. I always feel happy when
                        I see before me the wide expanse of water.\x22 Rome, of course, was a
                        center of fascination. Every day he picked out some special object
                        of interest to visit, which made that particular day one never to
                        be forgotten. The tour lasted until the spring of 1832, before
                        Mendelssohn returned to his home in Berlin, only to leave it shortly
                        afterwards to return to London. This great city, in spite of its fogs,
                        noises and turmoil, appealed to him more than the sunshine of Naples,
                        the fascination of Florence or the beauty of Rome.
                        It has taken more than half a century to establish the favor of the
                        Concerto, which still continues on upward wing. The writer heard the
                        composer play this Concerto in Berlin, toward the end of his life.
                        He made an unforgettable figure, as he sat at the piano with his long
                        hair and beard, turning to gray; and while his technic was not of
                        the virtuoso type, he created a powerful impression by his vivid
                        interpretation."

                        a unique composer, but also gained the reputation of being a very
                        unsociable man. Physically it has been said that in his youth he
                        seemed like an Assyrian Prince; through life he retained his somewhat
                        Asiatic appearance. His eyes were slightly narrowed, his black hair
                        curled lightly over an extremely broad forehead. He spoke little
                        and often in brusque phrase. For this reason he was frequently
                        misunderstood, as the irony and sarcasm with which he sometimes spoke
                        did not tend to make friends. But this attitude was only turned toward
                        those who did not comprehend him and his ideals, or who endeavored to
                        falsify what he believed in and esteemed.

  communication_note: "[Footnote 3: The literary work of Berlioz is rather uneven. Beside
                        passages of exquisite beauty we find others that are ridiculous in their
                        exaggerated sentiment, and there are some that even lack good taste. But
                        he had a natural gift of style, and his writing is vigorous, and full of
                        feeling, especially towards the latter half of his life. The _Procession
                        des Rogations_ is often quoted from the _Memoires_; and some of his
                        poetical text, particularly that in _LEnfance du Christ_ and in _Les
                        Troyens_, is written in beautiful language and with a fine sense of
                        rhythm. His _Memoires_ as a whole is one of the most delightful books
                        ever written by an artist. Wagner was a greater poet, but as a prose
                        writer Berlioz is infinitely superior. See Paul Morillots essay on
                        _Berlioz ecrivain_, 1903, Grenoble.] One would think that such an
                        imaginative and skilful writer, accustomed in his profession of critic
                        to express every shade of feeling, would be able to tell us more exactly
                        his ideas of art than a Beethoven or a Mozart. But it is not so. As too
                        much light may blind the vision, so too much intellect may hinder the
                        understanding. Berliozs mind spent itself in details; it reflected
                        light from too many facets, and did not focus itself in one strong beam
                        which would have made known his power. He did not know how to dominate
                        either his life or his work; he did not even try to dominate them. He
                        was the incarnation of romantic genius, an unrestrained force,
                        unconscious of the road he trod. I would not go so far as to say that he
                        did not understand himself, but there are certainly times when he is
                        past understanding himself. He allows himself to drift where chance will
                        take him,[4] like an old Scandinavian pirate laid at the bottom of his
                        boat, staring up at the sky; and he dreams and groans and laughs and
                        gives himself up to his feverish delusions. He lived with his emotions
                        as uncertainly as he lived with his art. In his music, as in his
                        criticisms of music, he often contradicts himself, hesitates, and turns
                        back; he is not sure either of his feelings or his thoughts. He has
                        poetry in his soul, and strives to write operas; but his admiration
                        wavers between Gluck and Meyerbeer. He has a popular genius, but
                        despises the people. He is a daring musical revolutionary, but he
                        allows the control of this musical movement to be taken from him by
                        anyone who wishes to have it. Worse than that: he disowns the movement,
                        turns his back upon the future, and throws himself again into the past.
                        For what reason? Very often he does not know. Passion, bitterness,
                        caprice, wounded pride--these have more influence with him than the
                        serious things of life. He is a man at war with himself.
                        The great composer was a big man, both physically and mentally. A
                        friend describes his countenance as full of fire; \x22when he smiled it
                        was like the sun bursting out of a black cloud. It was a sudden flash
                        of intelligence, wit and good humor, which illumined his countenance,
                        which I have hardly ever seen in any other.\x22 He could relish a joke,
                        and had a keen sense of humor. Few things outside his work interested
                        him; but he was fond of the theater, and liked to go to picture sales.
                        His fiery temper often led him to explode at trifles. No talking among
                        the listeners could be borne by him while he was conducting. He did
                        not hesitate to visit violent abuse on the heads of those who ventured
                        to speak while he was directing and not even the presence of royalty
                        could restrain his anger."

  communication_note: "Ludwig van Beethoven passed from this plane March 26, 1827, having
                        recently completed his fifty-sixth year, and was laid to rest in the
                        Wehring Cemetery near Vienna. Unlike Mozart, he was buried with much
                        honor. Twenty thousand people followed him to his grave. Among them
                        was Schubert, who had visited him on his deathbed, and was one of the
                        torch bearers. Several of the Masters compositions were sung by a
                        choir of male voices, accompanied by trombones. At the grave Hummel
                        laid three laurel wreaths on the casket.
                        \x22I cant understand how a really happy man could think of serving
                        art. If we enjoyed life, we should have no need of art. When the
                        present has nothing more to offer us we cry out our needs by means
                        of art. To have my youth again and my health, to enjoy nature, to
                        have a wife who would love me devotedly, and fine children--for
                        this I would give up _all my art_. Now I have said it--give me what
                        is left.\x22

  communication_note: "Mozart prepared to leave Paris at once, and his father was the
                        more willing, since the Archbishop of Salzburg offered Wolfgang
                        the position of Court organist, at a salary of 500 florins, with
                        permission to absent himself whenever he might be called upon to
                        conduct his own operas. Leopold urged Wolfgangs acceptance, as their
                        joint income would amount to one thousand florins a year--a sum that
                        would enable them to pay their debts and live in comparative comfort.
                        And at last he composed and grouped together twenty-four poems in his
                        _Poeme de la Vie humaine_[247]--fine odes and songs, written for classic
                        airs and choruses, a vast repertory of the peoples joys and sorrows,
                        fitting the momentous hours of family or public life. With a people that
                        has ancient musical traditions, as Germany has, music is the vehicle for
                        the words and impresses them in the heart; but in Frances case it is
                        truer to say that the words have brought the music of Haendel and
                        Beethoven into the hearts of French school-children. The great thing is
                        that the music has really got hold of them, and that now one may hear
                        the provincial Ecoles Normales performing choruses from _Fidelio, The
                        Messiah_, Schumanns _Faust_, or Bach cantatas.[248] The honour of this
                        remarkable achievement, which no one could have believed possible twenty
                        years ago, belongs almost entirely to M. Maurice Buchor.[249]"

  communication_note: "Hardly had he left the school when he was drafted for the army. This
                        meant several years of virtual captivity, for conscription could not
                        be avoided. The only other thing he could do was to return home and
                        become a teacher in his fathers school. He chose the lesser evil and
                        qualified at once to become his fathers assistant, which would also
                        assure him a certain amount of leisure. We can imagine him installed
                        as teacher of the infant class, and realize how distasteful was the
                        daily round of school work, and how he longed to have it over, that he
                        might put on paper all the lovely themes that had come to him through
                        the school day. Other bright spots were the happy hours he spent with
                        the Grob family, who lived also in the district of Lichtenthal.
                        The family consisted of a mother, a son and daughter. They were all
                        musical. Therese Grob had a fine voice and she enjoyed the songs
                        Schubert brought her to sing, while her brother Heinrich could play
                        both piano and cello. Many evenings filled with music were passed by
                        the young people. His friends at the Convict too, welcomed each new
                        piece he wrote. Nor did he forget his old master Holzer, the organist
                        of the little church where the composer himself regularly attended.
                        During 1814, Schubert composed his first mass, which was performed
                        October 16. It excited so much interest that it was repeated ten days
                        later at the Augustine church. Franz conducted, the choir was led
                        by Holzer, Ferdinand sat at the organ, and Therese sang the soprano
                        solos. In the audience sat old Salieri, Court Capellmeister of Vienna,
                        with whom Beethoven had studied. Salieri praised Schubert for his
                        work, and said that he should become his pupil. He kept his word and
                        gave the young composer daily lessons for some time. The father was
                        so proud and happy that he bought a five octave piano for his boy, to
                        celebrate the event.
                        One may see by this short account what a heterogeneous work it is. Two
                        or three quite different worlds are brought into it: the realism of the
                        bourgeois characters of Vitas mother and lover is mixed up with
                        symbolisms of Christianity, represented by the Stranger, and with the
                        fairy-tale of the magic emerald and the voices of the ocean. This
                        complexity, which is evident enough in the poem, is even more evident in
                        the music, where a union of different arts and different ideas is
                        attempted. We get the art of the folk-song, religious art, the art of
                        Wagner, the art of Franck, as well as a note of familiar realism (which
                        is something akin to the Italian _opera-bouffe_) and descriptions of
                        sensation that are quite personal. As there are only two short acts, the
                        rapidity of the action only serves to accentuate this impression. The
                        changes are very abrupt: we are hurried from a world of human beings to
                        a world of abstract ideas, and then taken from an atmosphere of religion
                        to a land of fairies. The work is, however, clear enough from a musical
                        point of view. The more complex the elements that M. dIndy gathers
                        round him the more anxious he is to bring them into harmony. It is a
                        difficult task, and is only possible when the different elements are
                        reduced to their simplest expression and brought down to their
                        fundamental qualities--thus depriving them of the spice of their
                        individuality. M. dIndy puts different styles and ideas on the anvil,
                        and then forges them vigorously. It is natural that here and there we
                        should see the mark of the hammer, the imprint of his determination; but
                        it is only by his determination that he welded the work into a solid
                        whole.
                        And now back in Paris, at the treadmill of writing again. Berlioz had
                        the sort of mentality which could plan, and also execute, big musical
                        enterprises on a grand scale. It was proposed that he and Strauss
                        should give a couple of monster concerts in the Exhibition Building.
                        He got together a body of 1022 performers, all paid except the singers
                        from the lyric theaters, who volunteered to help for the love of
                        music."

                        fitted M. dIndy for this part. By his knowledge and his precise,
                        orderly mind he must be a perfect teacher of composition. If I submit
                        some question of harmony or melodic phrasing to his analysis, the result
                        is the essence of clear, logical reasoning; and if the reasoning is a
                        little dry and simplifies the thing almost too much, it is still very
                        illuminating and from the hand of a master of French prose. And in this
                        I find him exercising the same consistent instinct of good sense and
                        sincerity, the same art of development, the same seventeenth and
                        eighteenth century principles of classic rhetoric that he applies to his
                        music. In truth, M. dIndy could write a musical _Discourse on Style_,
                        if he wished."

  communication_note: "It was the _Symphonie funebre et triomphale_ for two orchestras and a
                        choir, and the _Te Deum_ for orchestra, organ, and three choirs, which
                        Berlioz loved (whose finale _Judex crederis_ seemed to him the most
                        effective thing he had ever written[99]), as well as the _Imperiale_,
                        for two orchestras and two choirs, and the famous _Requiem_, with its
                        \x22four orchestras of brass instruments, placed round the main orchestra
                        and the mass of voices, but separated and answering one another at a
                        distance.\x22 Like the _Requiem_, these compositions are often crude in
                        style and of rather commonplace sentiment, but their grandeur is
                        overwhelming. This is not due only to the hugeness of the means
                        employed, but also to \x22the breadth of the style and to the formidable
                        slowness of some of the progressions--whose final aim one cannot
                        guess--which gives these compositions a strangely gigantic
                        character.\x22[100] Berlioz has left in these compositions striking
                        examples of the beauty that may reveal itself in a crude mass of music.
                        Like the towering Alps, they move one by their very immensity. A German
                        critic says: \x22In these Cyclopean works the composer lets the elemental
                        and brute forces of sound and pure rhythm have their fling.\x22[101] It is
                        scarcely music, it is the force of Nature herself. Berlioz himself calls
                        his _Requiem_ \x22a musical cataclysm.\x22[102]

                        than this continuous defile, for the past ten years, of _Kapellmeister_
                        and foreign virtuosi, and the comparisons that their different styles
                        and interpretations afforded. Nothing has better helped forward the
                        improvement of Parisian orchestras than the emulation brought about by
                        the meetings between Parisian conductors and those of other countries.
                        At present our own conductors are worthy rivals of the best in Germany.
                        The string instruments are good; the wood has kept its old French
                        superiority; and though the brass is still the weakest part of our
                        orchestras, it has made great progress. One may still criticise the
                        grouping of orchestras at concerts, for it is often defective; there is
                        a disproportion between the different families of instruments and, in
                        consequence, between their different sonorities, some of which are too
                        thin and others too dull. But these defects are fairly common all over
                        Europe to-day. Unhappily, more peculiar to France is the insufficiency
                        or poor quality of the choirs, whose progress has been far from keeping
                        pace with that of the orchestras. It is to this side of music that the
                        directors of concerts must now bring their efforts to bear."

  communication_note: "The boy Ludwig could play the organ fairly well, as he had studied it
                        with Christian Neefe, who was organist at the Court church. He also
                        could play the piano with force and finish, read well at sight and
                        knew nearly the whole of Bachs \x22Well Tempered Clavichord.\x22 This was
                        a pretty good record for a boy of 11, who, if he went on as he had
                        begun, it was said, would become a second Mozart.
                        But dreams were turned into deeds before long, for the child tried to
                        set down on paper the little melodies that haunted him. It is said he
                        began to do this at the age of nine. A really serious attempt was
                        made when he was twelve or thirteen. This was a set of variations for
                        piano, on a German melody. He brought it to school one day to show one
                        of the boys. The teacher caught sight of it and reprimanded the young
                        composer soundly, for thus idling his time. It seems that in school he
                        was fond of dreaming away the hours, just as he did at the piano.
                        Leopold Mozart was distracted at news of this project. He at once
                        wrote, advising his son to go to Paris and try there to make a name
                        and fame for himself. The son dutifully yielded at once. With a heavy
                        heart he prepared to leave Mannheim, where he had spent such a happy
                        winter, and his love dream came to an end. It was a sad parting with
                        the Weber household, for they regarded Wolfgang as their greatest
                        benefactor.
                        Berlioz was disheartened. Life had conquered him. It was not that he had
                        lost any of his artistic mastery; on the contrary, his compositions
                        became more and more finished; and nothing in his earlier work attained
                        the pure beauty of some of the pages of _LEnfance du Christ_ (1850-4),
                        or of _Les Troyens_ (1855-63). But he was losing his power; and his
                        intense feeling, his revolutionary ideas, and his inspiration (which in
                        his youth had taken the place of the confidence he lacked) were failing
                        him. He now lived on the past--the _Huit scenes de Faust_ (1828) held
                        the germs of _La Damnation de Faust_ (1846); since 1833, he had been
                        thinking of _Beatrice et Benedict_ (1862); the ideas in _Les Troyens_
                        were inspired by his childish worship of Virgil, and had been with him
                        all his life. But with what difficulty he now finished his task! He had
                        only taken seven months to write _Romeo_, and \x22on account of not being
                        able to write the _Requiem_ fast enough, he had adopted a kind of
                        musical shorthand\x22;[63] but he took seven or eight years to write _Les
                        Troyens_, alternating between moods of enthusiasm and disgust, and
                        feeling indifference and doubt about his work. He groped his way
                        hesitatingly and unsteadily; he hardly understood what he was doing. He
                        admired the more mediocre pages of his work: the scene of the Laocoon,
                        the finale of the last act of the _Les Troyens a Troie_, the last scene
                        with Aeneas in _Les Troyens a Carthage_.[64] The empty pomposities of
                        Spontini mingle with the loftiest conceptions. One might say that his
                        genius became a stranger to him: it was the mechanical work of an
                        unconscious force, like \x22stalactites in a dripping grotto.\x22 He had no
                        impetus. It was only a matter of time before the roof of the grotto
                        would give way. One is struck with the mournful despair with which he
                        works; it is his last will and testament that he is making. And when he
                        has finished it, he will have finished everything. His work is ended; if
                        he lived another hundred years he would not have the heart to add
                        anything more to it. The only thing that remains--and it is what he is
                        about to do--is to wrap himself in silence and die."

                        The new opera \x22Radamisto\x22 was ready early in 1720, and produced at the
                        Royal Academy of Music, as the theater was now called. The success
                        of the production was tremendous. But Handel, by his self-will had
                        stirred up envy and jealousy, and an opposition party was formed,
                        headed by his old enemy from Hamburg, Buononcini, who had come to
                        London to try his fortunes. A test opera was planned, of which Handel
                        wrote the third act, Buononcini the second and a third musician the
                        first. When the new work was performed, the third act was pronounced
                        by the judges much superior to the second. But Buononcinis friends
                        would not accept defeat, and the battle between all parties was
                        violent. Newspapers were full of it, and many verses were written.
                        Handel cared not a whit for all this tempest, but calmly went his way."

  communication_note: "While living in Weimar, Liszt made frequent journeys to Rome and to
                        Paris. In 1861 there was a rumor that the object of his visits to
                        Rome was to gain Papal consent to his marriage with the Princess
                        Sayn-Wittgenstein. During a visit to Rome in 1864, the musician was
                        unable to resist longer the mysticism of the church. He decided to
                        take orders and was made an Abbe.
                        [Footnote 228: The Schola had in mind here the vigorous work of the
                        French Benedictines, which had been done in silence for the past fifty
                        years; it was thinking, too, of the restoration of the Gregorian chant
                        during 1850 and 1860 by Dom Gueranger, the first abbot of Solesmes, a
                        work continued by Dom Jausions and Dom Pothier, the abbot of
                        Saint-Wandrille, who published in 1883 the _Melodies Gregoriennes_, the
                        _Liber Gradualis_, and the _Liber Antiphonarius_. This work was finally
                        brought to a happy conclusion by Dom Schmitt, and Dom Mocqucreau, the
                        prior of Solesmes, who in 1889 began his monumental work, the
                        _Paleo-graphie Musicals_, of which nine volumes had appeared in 1906.
                        This great Benedictine school is an honour to France by the scientific
                        work it has lately done in music. The school is at present exiled from
                        France.]
                        It may seem a paradox to say that no musician is so little known as
                        Berlioz. The world thinks it knows him. A noisy fame surrounds his
                        person and his work. Musical Europe has celebrated his centenary.
                        Germany disputes with France the glory of having nurtured and shaped his
                        genius. Russia, whose triumphal reception consoled him for the
                        indifference and enmity of Paris,[1] has said, through the voice of
                        Balakirew, that he was \x22the only musician France possessed.\x22 His chief
                        compositions are often played at concerts; and some of them have the
                        rare quality of appealing both to the cultured and the crowd; a few have
                        even reached great popularity. Works have been dedicated to him, and he
                        himself has been described and criticised by many writers. He is popular
                        even to his face; for his face, like his music, was so striking and
                        singular that it seemed to show you his character at a glance. No clouds
                        hide his mind and its creations, which, unlike Wagners, need no
                        initiation to be understood; they seem to have no hidden meaning, no
                        subtle mystery; one is instantly their friend or their enemy, for the
                        first impression is a lasting one.
                        Of all the characteristics of Francks fine moral nature, the most
                        remarkable was his religious faith. It must have astonished the artists
                        of his time, who were even more destitute of such a thing than they are
                        now. It made itself felt in some of his followers, especially in those
                        who were near the masters heart, as M. dIndy was. The religious
                        thought of the latter reflects in some degree the thought of his master;
                        though the shape of that thought may have undergone unconscious
                        alteration. I do not know if Franck altogether fits the conception
                        people have of him to-day. I do not want to introduce personal memories
                        of him here. I knew him well enough to love him, and to catch a glimpse
                        of the beauty and sincerity of his soul; but I did not know him well
                        enough to discover the secrets of his mind. Those who had the happiness
                        of being his intimate friends seem always to represent him as a mystic
                        who shut himself away from the spirit of his time. I hope at some future
                        date one of his friends will publish some of the conversations that he
                        had with him, of which I have heard. But this man who had so strong a
                        faith was also very independent. In his religion he had no doubts: it
                        was the mainspring of his life; though faith with him was much more a
                        matter of feeling than a matter of doctrine. But all was feeling with
                        Franck, and reason made little appeal to him. His religious faith did
                        not disturb his mind, for he did not measure men and their works by its
                        rules; and he would have been incapable of putting together a history of
                        art according to the Bible. This great Catholic had at times a very
                        pagan soul; and he could enjoy without a qualm the musical dilettantism
                        of Renan and the sonorous nihilism of Leconte de Lisle. There were no
                        limits to his vast sympathies. He did not attempt to criticise the thing
                        he loved--understanding was already in his heart. Perhaps he was right;
                        and perhaps there was more trouble in the depths of his heart than the
                        valiant serenity of its surface would lead us to believe."

  communication_note: "At SantAgata the master lived a quiet, retired life. The estate was
                        situated about two miles from Busseto, and was very large, with a
                        great park, a large collection of horses and other live stock. The
                        residence was spacious, and the masters special bedroom was on the
                        first floor. It was large, light and airy and luxuriously furnished.
                        Here stood a magnificent grand piano, and the composer often rose in
                        the night to jot down the themes which came to him in the silence of
                        the midnight hours. Here \x22Don Carlos\x22 was written. In one of the upper
                        rooms stood the old spinet that Verdi hacked at as a child.
                        \x22I can never tell you what a really wretched musician I am. In my
                        inmost heart I know I am a bungler and an absolute failure. You
                        should see me when I say to myself, It ought to go now, and sit
                        down to the piano and put together some miserable rubbish, which I
                        fling away again like an idiot. I know quite well the kind of
                        musical trash I produce.... Believe me, it is no good expecting me
                        to do anything decent. Sometimes I really think it was Reissiger
                        who inspired me to write _Tannhaeuser_ and _Lohengrin_.\x22
                        Quite near the old piano stood little Franz, not yet six. He was
                        absolutely absorbed in the music. The fair curls fell about his
                        childish face and his deep blue eyes were raised to his father,
                        as though the latter were some sort of magician, creating all this
                        beauty.
                        It was open war against the metrical art of the last three centuries, in
                        the name of national tradition (more or less freely interpreted), of
                        folk-song, and of Gregorian chant. And \x22the constant and avowed purpose
                        of all this campaign was the triumph of French music, and its
                        cult.\x22[259]"

                        best sense; I know it is the highest praise one can give M. dIndy).
                        This work has not received the attention it deserves. It is a record of
                        the spirit of contemporary art; and if it stands rather apart from other
                        writings, it should not be allowed to pass unnoticed on that account."

                        Singing at the Conservatoire, and M. Camille Saint-Saens. And, following
                        their initiative, Cesar Franck, Ernest Guiraud, Massenet, Garcin,
                        Gabriel Faure, Henri Duparc, Theodore Dubois, and Taffanel, joined
                        forces with them, and at a meeting on 25 February, 1871, agreed to found
                        a musical society that should give hearings to the works of living
                        French composers exclusively. The first meetings were interrupted by the
                        doings of the Commune; but they began again in October, 1871. The
                        Societys early statutes were drawn up by Alexis de Castillon, a
                        military officer and a talented composer, who, after having served in
                        the war of 1870 at the head of the _mobiles_ of Eure-et-Loire, was one
                        of the founders of French chamber-music, and died prematurely in 1873,
                        aged thirty-five. It was these statutes, signed by Saint-Saens,
                        Castillon, and Garcin, that gave the Society its title of _Societe
                        Nationale de Musique_, and its device, \x22_Ars gallica_.\x22 This is what the
                        statutes say about the aims of the Society:"

                        friends, fell deeply in love with Marie Moke, a beautiful, talented
                        girl who, later on, won considerable fame as a pianist. She became
                        interested in the young French composer, through hearing of his mental
                        suffering from Hiller. They were thrown together in a school where
                        both gave lessons, she on the piano and he on the--guitar! Meeting so
                        constantly, her dainty beauty won a warm place in the affections of
                        the impressionable Hector. She was but eighteen, while her admirer was
                        twenty-five.
                        Edward MacDowell has been acclaimed Americas greatest composer. If
                        we try to substitute another name in its place, one of equal potency
                        cannot be found.
                        Hannes was docile, eager and quick to learn. He had a wonderful memory
                        and made rapid progress. In three years a concert was arranged for
                        him, at which he played in chamber music with several other musicians
                        of Hamburg. The concert was both a financial and artistic success. Not
                        long after this, Cossel induced Edward Marxsen, a distinguished master
                        and his own teacher, to take full charge of the lads further musical
                        training. Hannes was about twelve at the time."

                        it were possible to play them. \x22I was so ignorant,\x22 he says, \x22of the

                        feared it would be terribly difficult to play. So I went, very anxious,
                        to one of the trombonists of the Opera orchestra. He looked at the
                        passage and reassured me. The key of D flat is, he said, one of the
                        pleasantest for that instrument; and you can count on a splendid effect

                        We find Robert Schumann at nineteen domiciled in the beautiful city of
                        Heidelberg, and surrounded by a few musical friends, who were kindred
                        spirits. With a good piano in his room, the \x22life of flowers,\x22 as
                        he called it, began. Almost daily they made delightful trips in a
                        one-horse carriage into the suburbs. For longer trips they went to
                        Baden-Baden, Wurms, Spires and Mannheim. Whenever Robert went with
                        his friends he always carried a small \x22dumb piano\x22 on which he
                        industriously practised finger exercises, meanwhile joining in the
                        conversation. During the following August and September, Robert and
                        two or three chosen companions made a delightful journey through
                        Italy, the young man preparing himself by studying Latin, in which he
                        became so fluent that he could translate poems from one language to
                        the other.

                        strict teacher, who did not allow any trifling; the dreamy child found
                        he could not idle away his time. As he wrote later: \x22Only too soon it
                        became clear to me I had to practise just what was unpleasant. Had I
                        not inherited my mothers irrepressible energy as well as her musical
                        capacity, I should never have succeeded in passing from dreams to
                        deeds.\x22"

                        like the rest of the populace. And the simple phrase at the beginning

                        passage, a mere phrase, innumerable times to achieve a certain tonal

                        At Munich where they first halted, Wolfgang sought an engagement
                        at the Electors Court. He had an audience at the Nymphenburg, a
                        magnificent palace on the outskirts of the city. The Elector said
                        there was no vacancy; he did not know but later it might be possible
                        to make one, after Mozart had been to Italy and had made a name for
                        himself. With these words the Elector turned away. Mozart stood as
                        if stunned. To Italy, when he had concertized there for about seven
                        years, and had been showered with honors! It was too much. He shook
                        off the dust of Munich and he and his mother went on to Mannheim.
                        Here was a more congenial atmosphere. The Elector maintained a fine
                        orchestra, and with the conductor, Cannabich, Mozart became great
                        friends, giving music lessons to his daughter. But he could not seem
                        to secure a permanent appointment at Court, worthy his genius and
                        ability. Money became more scarce and the father and sister must make
                        many sacrifices at home to send money to maintain mother and son. With
                        the best of intentions Wolfgang failed to make his way except as a
                        piano teacher. The father had resorted to the same means of securing
                        the extra sums required, and wrote quite sharply to the son to bestir
                        himself and get something settled for the future."

                        taking their share in it, and music was beginning to invade the
                        University.
                        Just after completing his great work, The Art of Fugue, Bach became
                        totally blind, due no doubt, to the great strain he had always put
                        upon his eyes, in not only writing his own music, but in copying out
                        large works of the older masters. Notwithstanding this handicap he
                        continued at work up to the very last. On the morning of the day on
                        which he passed away, July 28, 1750, he suddenly regained his sight. A

                        The next great work undertaken by Berlioz was the Requiem. It seems
                        that, in 1836, the French Minister of the Interior set aside yearly,

                        without Liszt he could not have written _Samson et Dalila_. \x22Not only
                        did Liszt have _Samson et Dalila_ performed at Weimar, but without him
                        that work would never have come into being. My suggestions on the
                        subject had met with such hostility that I had given up the idea of
                        writing it; and all that existed were some illegible notes.... Then at
                        Weimar one day I spoke to Liszt about it, and he said to me, quite
                        trustingly and without having heard a note, Finish your work; I will
                        have it performed here. The events of 1870 delayed its performance for
                        several years.\x22 (_Revue Musicale_, 8 November, 1901).]"

  communication_note: "In Schuberts boyhood, the music of Mozart influenced him most. This
                        is seen in his earlier compositions. Beethoven was a great master
                        to him then, but as time went on the spell of his music always grew
                        stronger. In 1822, he wrote and published a set of variations on a
                        French air, and dedicated them to Beethoven. He greatly desired to
                        present them in person to the master he adored, but was too shy to go
                        alone. Diabelli, the publisher, finally went with him. Beethoven was
                        courteous but formal, pushing paper and pencil toward his guest, as he
                        was totally deaf. Schubert was too shy to write a single word.
                        However he produced his Variations. Beethoven seemed pleased with the
                        dedication, and looked through the music. Soon he found something in
                        it he did not approve of and pointed it out. The young author, losing
                        his presence of mind, fled from the house. But Beethoven really liked
                        the music and often played it to his nephew.
                        The young composer now started work on a second opera, the first,
                        called \x22The Marriage,\x22 was found impracticable. The new work was
                        entitled \x22The Fairies.\x22 This he finished, and the work, performed
                        years later, was found to be imitative of Beethoven, Weber, and
                        Marschner; the music was nevertheless very melodious."

  communication_note: "A new world indeed opened to the six year old boy, but it was not all
                        beautiful. Frankh was a careful and strict teacher; Josef not only was
                        taught to sing well, but learned much about various instruments.
                        He had school lessons also. But his life in other ways was hard
                        and cheerless. The wife of his cousin treated him with the utmost
                        indifference, never looking after his clothing or his well being in
                        any way. After a time his destitute and neglected appearance was
                        a source of misery to the refined, sensitive boy, but he tried to
                        realize that present conditions could not last forever, and he bravely
                        endeavored to make the best of them. Meanwhile the training of his
                        voice was well advanced and when not in school he could nearly always
                        be found in church, listening to the organ and the singing. Not long
                        after, he was admitted to the choir, where his sweet young voice
                        joined in the church anthems. Always before his mind was a great city
                        where he knew he would find the most beautiful music--the music of his
                        dreams. That city was Vienna, but it lay far away. Josef looked down
                        at his ragged clothing and wondered if he would ever see that magical
                        city.
                        Beethoven as a teacher, showed none of the impatience and carelessness
                        that were seen in his personal habits. He insisted on a pupil
                        repeating the passage carefully a number of times, until it could be
                        played to his satisfaction. He did not seem to mind a few wrong notes,
                        but the pupil must not fail to grasp the meaning or put in the right
                        expression, or his anger would be aroused. The first was an accident,
                        the other would be a lack of knowledge of feeling."

                        transcendently beautiful music. His stature as a conductor grew
                        with the years and so did the repertoire of scores he conducted from
                        memory. This feat involved heartbreaking work, for his memory, while
                        good, is not unusually retentive. In the middle years of his career,
                        he devoted from ten to twelve hours a day to studying scores.
                        \x22I am weary of life; and I am forced to see that belief in
                        absurdities is necessary to human minds, and that it is born in
                        them as insects are born in swamps.\x22[40]
                        We are all enslaved by the musical tradition of the past. For
                        generations we have been so accustomed to carry this yoke that we
                        scarcely notice it. And in consequence of Germanys monopoly of music
                        since the end of the eighteenth century, musical traditions--which had
                        been chiefly Italian in the two preceding centuries--now became almost
                        entirely German. We think in German forms: the plan of phrases, their
                        development, their balance, and all the rhetoric of music and the
                        grammar of composition comes to us from foreign thought, slowly
                        elaborated by German masters. That domination has never been more
                        complete or more heavy since Wagners victory. Then reigned over the
                        world this great German period--a scaly monster with a thousand arms,
                        whose grasp was so extensive that it included pages, scenes, acts, and
                        whole dramas in its embrace. We cannot say that French writers have ever
                        tried to write in the style of Goethe or Schiller; but French composers
                        have tried and are still trying to write music after the manner of
                        German musicians."

                        happiness was in creation, and he saw his life cease, without any
                        apparent cause, for years together, and his genius come and go, and
                        return for an instant, and then go again. Each time he must have
                        anxiously wondered if it had gone for ever, or how long it would be
                        before it came back again. In letters to Kaufmann on 6 August, 1891, and
                        26 April, 1893, he says:
                        But if the spirit of this academy has often destroyed the effect of the
                        excellent teaching there, by making success in academic competitions the
                        chief aim of the professors and their pupils, yet a certain freedom has
                        always reigned in the institution. And though this freedom is mainly the
                        result of indifference, it has, however, permitted the more independent
                        temperaments to develop in peace--from Berlioz to M. Ravel. One should
                        be grateful for this. But such virtues are too negative to give the
                        Conservatoire a high place in the musical history of the Third Republic;
                        and it is only lately, under the direction of M. Gabriel Faure, that it
                        has endeavoured, not without difficulty, to get back its place at the
                        head of French art, which it had lost, and which others had taken."

  communication_note: "In 1866, the feeling against Wagner had somewhat declined and the King
                        decided to have model performances of \x22Tannheuser\x22 and \x22Lohengrin\x22
                        at Munich. The Festival began June 11, 1867. The following year \x22Die

                        spread widely. Honors had been bestowed on him by many royalties.
                        The King of Saxony had made him Capellmeister of his Court, and Queen
                        Victoria had shown him many proofs of personal regard, which endeared
                        him more than ever to the country which had first signally recognized

                        In the south of France, near Grenoble, is found a romantic spot, La
                        Cete Saint-Andre. It lies on a hillside overlooking a wide green and
                        golden plain, and its dreamy majesty is accentuated by the line of
                        mountains that bounds it on the southeast. These in turn are crowned
                        by the distant glory of snowy peaks and Alpine glaciers. Here one of
                        the most distinguished men of the modern movement in French musical
                        art, Hector Berlioz, first saw the light, on December 11, 1803.
                        I want to show, by this simple account, the splendid efforts made by
                        musicians in France since 1870, and the growth of the faith and energy
                        that has recreated French music. Such an awakening seems to me a fine
                        thing to look upon, and very comforting. But few people in France
                        realise it, outside a handful of musicians. It is to the public at large
                        I dedicate these pages, so that they may know what a generation of
                        artists with large hearts and strong determination have done for the
                        honour of our race. The nation must not be allowed to forget what she
                        owes to some of her sons."

                        Handel tried for several years to keep Italian opera going in London,
                        in spite of the lack of musical taste and the opposition of his
                        enemies; but in 1737, he was forced to give up the struggle. He was
                        deeply in debt, his whole fortune of ten thousand pounds had been
                        swept away and his health broken by anxiety. He would not give up;
                        after a brief rest, he returned to London to begin the conflict anew.
                        The effort to re-awaken the English publics interest in Italian opera
                        seemed useless, and the composer at last gave up the struggle. He was
                        now fifty-five, and began to think of turning his attention to more
                        serious work. Handel has been called the father of the oratorio; he
                        composed at least twenty-eight works in this style, the best

                        This year of 1847 was a very active one outside of the musical
                        journeys. The master composed several piano trios, much choral music,
                        and began the opera \x22Genevieve,\x22 which was not completed however,
                        until the middle of 1848. All the compositions of the previous year
                        were perfectly lucid and sane. The opera unfortunately had a text from
                        which all the beauty and romance had been left out.
                        It was indeed a wonderful tour which they made in Italy, though there
                        is not time to tell of many things that happened. On their return to
                        Rome, the Pope gave him the order of the Golden Spur, which made him
                        Chevalier de Mozart. Arriving at Bologna the young musician was made a
                        member of the Accademia Filharmonica. The test for this admission was
                        setting an antiphon in four parts. Wolfgang was locked in a room till
                        the task should be finished. To the astonishment of everybody he asked
                        to be let out at the end of half an hour,--having completed the work.
                        The first act of _Siegfried_ is one of the most dramatic in the
                        Tetralogy. Nothing satisfied me more completely at Bayreuth, both as
                        regards the actors and the dramatic effects. Fantastic creatures like
                        Alberich and Mimi, who seem to be out of their element in France, are
                        rooted deep down in German imaginations. The Bayreuth actors surpassed
                        themselves in making them startlingly lifelike, with a trembling and
                        grimacing realism. Burgstaller, who was then making his debut in
                        _Siegfried_, acted with an impetuous awkwardness which accorded well
                        with the part. I remember with what zest--which seemed in no way
                        affected--he played the hero smith, labouring like a true workman,
                        blowing the fire and making the blade glow, dipping it in the steaming
                        water, and working it on the anvil; and then, in a burst of Homeric
                        gaiety, singing that fine hymn at the end of the first act, which sounds
                        like an air by Bach or Haendel."

                        Brahms passed from youth to manhood. With the opening year of 1854, he
                        may be said to enter the portals of a new life.
                        Wolf never chose commonplace poems for his music--which is more than can
                        be said of Schubert or Schumann. He did not use anything written by
                        contemporary poets, although he was in sympathy with some of them, such
                        as Liliencron, who hoped very much to be translated into music by him.
                        But he could not do it; he could not use anything in the work of a great
                        poet unless he became so intimate with it that it seemed to be a part of
                        him."

  communication_note: "After this secret practising had been going on for some time, it was
                        discovered one night, when little George was enjoying his favorite
                        pastime. He had been missed and the whole house went in search.
                        Finally the father, holding high the lantern in his hand and followed
                        by mother and the rest of the inmates, reached the garret, and there
                        found the lost child seated at his beloved spinet, quite lost to
                        the material world. There is no record of any angry outburst on the
                        fathers part and it is likely little George was left in peace.
                        Weber paid a visit to Liebich, director of the Prague theater, almost
                        as soon as he arrived in town. The invalid director greeted him
                        warmly.
                        Weber was buried in London. His last wish--to return home,--was
                        finally fulfilled. Eighteen years after, his remains were brought to
                        Dresden, and the composer was at last at home.
                        During the early years at Zurich Wagners only musical activity was
                        conducting a few orchestral concerts. Then, one day, he took out the
                        score of his \x22Lohengrin,\x22 and read it, something he rarely did with
                        any of his works. Seized with a deep desire to have this opera brought
                        out, he sent a pleading letter to Liszt, begging him to produce the
                        work. Liszt faithfully accomplished this task at Weimar, where he was
                        conducting the Court Opera. The date chosen was Goethes birthday,
                        August 28, and the year 1850. Wagner was most anxious to be present,
                        but the risk of arrest prevented him from venturing on German soil.
                        It was not till 1861, in Vienna, that the composer heard this the most
                        popular of all his operas. Liszt was profoundly moved by the beautiful
                        work, and wrote his enthusiasm to the composer."

                        should reign supreme and make one forget everything else.... In an opera
                        it is absolutely necessary that Poetry should be Musics obedient
                        daughter\x22 (Letter to his father, 13 October, 1781). Despairing probably
                        at being unable to obtain this obedience, Mozart thought seriously of
                        breaking up the form of opera, and of putting in its place, in 1778, a
                        sort of melodrama (of which Rousseau had given an example in 1773),
                        which he called \x22duodrama,\x22 where music and poetry were loosely
                        associated, yet not dependent on each other, but went side by side on
                        two parallel roads (Letter of 12 November, 1778).]
                        This then was the birthplace of the \x22most poetical composer who ever
                        lived,\x22 as Liszt said of him; the man who created over six hundred
                        songs, eight symphonies, operas, masses, chamber works and much
                        beautiful piano music, and yet only lived to be thirty-one. It is
                        almost unbelievable. Let us get a nearer view of this remarkable
                        musician."

                        who appeared in Paris in 1831. This style of playing made a deep

                        accomplished on the violin, in the matter of tone quality and
                        intensity. He procured the newly published Caprices for violin and

                        Mendelssohn had been greatly pleased with his London visit, and though

                        transferred, Lamoureux conducted, for the first time in Paris, the first
                        act of the _Walkuere_. In these concerts the tenor, Van Dyck, made his
                        _debut_; later, he was one of the leading performers at Bayreuth. In
                        1886-1887 Lamoureux rehearsed and conducted the only performance of
                        _Lohengrin_ at the Eden theatre. Disturbances in the streets prevented
                        further performances. Lamoureux then established himself in the
                        concert-room of the Cirque des Champs Elysees, where for eleven years he
                        has given what are called the _Concerts-Lamoureux_. He continued to
                        spread the knowledge of Wagners works, and has sometimes had the help
                        of some of the most celebrated of the Bayreuth artists, among others,
                        that of Mme. Materna and Lilli Lehmann. At the end of the season of 1897
                        Lamoureux wished to disband his orchestra in order to conduct concerts
                        abroad. But the members of the orchestra decided to remain together
                        under the name of the _Association des Concerts-Lamoureux_, with
                        Lamoureuxs son-in-law, M. Camille Chevillard, as conductor. But
                        Lamoureux was not long before he returned to the conductorship of the
                        concerts, which had now returned to the Chateau-dEau theatre; and a few
                        months before his death, in 1899, he conducted the first performance of
                        _Tristan_ at the Nouveau theatre. And so he had the happiness of being
                        present at the complete triumph of the cause for which he had fought so
                        stubbornly for nearly twenty years.[220]"

                        with Anton Rubinstein as director, and Tschaikowsky lost no time in
                        entering as a pupil, studying composition and kindred subjects with
                        Professor Zaremba. His progress was so rapid in the several branches
                        he took up--piano, organ and flute--that Rubinstein advised him to
                        make music his profession, and throw his law studies to the winds.
                        Thanks to Rubinstein, he secured some pupils and also engagements as
                        accompanist. Meanwhile he worked industriously at composition, and one
                        of his pieces was a Concert Overture in F, scored for small orchestra.
                        In 1865 he took his diploma as a musician and also secured a silver
                        medal for a cantata. One year after this the Moscow Conservatoire
                        was founded, with Nicholas Rubinstein at its head. The position
                        of Professor of Composition and Musical History was offered to
                        Tschaikowsky, then only twenty-six. It was a flattering offer for so
                        young a man, when many older heads would have liked to secure such
                        an honor. He moved to Moscow, and retained his position in the
                        Conservatoire for at least twelve years, in the meantime making many
                        friends for himself and his art, as his fame as a composer grew. One
                        of these friends was the publisher Jurgenson, who was to play rather
                        an important part in the composers life, through accepting and
                        putting forth his compositions."

                        The people of Dublin warmly welcomed Handel, and the new oratorio,
                        the \x22Messiah,\x22 was performed at Music Hall, with choirs of both
                        cathedrals, and with some concertos on the organ played by the
                        composer. The performance took place, April 13, 1742. Four hundred
                        pounds were realized, which were given to charity. The success was so
                        great that a second performance was announced. Ladies were requested
                        to come without crinoline, thereby providing a hundred more seats than
                        at the first event.
                        He was taken to Dr. Svetlins private hospital in Vienna, and remained
                        there until January, 1898. Happily he had devoted friends who took care
                        of him and made up for the indifference of the public; for what he had
                        earned himself would not have enabled him even to die in peace. When
                        Schott, the publisher, sent him in October, 1895, his royalties for the
                        editions of his _Lieder_ of Moerike, Goethe, Eichendorff, Keller, Spanish
                        poetry, and the first volume of Italian poetry, their total for five
                        years came to eighty-six marks and thirty-five pfennigs! And Schott
                        calmly added that he had not expected so good a result. So it was Wolfs
                        friends, and especially Hugo Faisst, who not only saved him from misery
                        by their unobtrusive and often secret generosity, but spared him the
                        horror of destitution in his last misfortunes.
                        The composer conceived the idea of writing the last named work in
                        1741. Towards the end of this year he was invited to visit Ireland
                        to make known some of his works. On the way there he was detained at
                        Chester for several days by contrary winds. He must have had the score
                        of the \x22Messiah\x22 with him, for he got together some choir boys to try
                        over a few of the choral parts. \x22Can you sing at sight?\x22 was put to
                        each boy before he was asked to sing. One broke down at the start.
                        \x22What de devil you mean!\x22 cried the impetuous composer, snatching the
                        music from him. \x22Didnt you say you could sing at sight?\x22"

  communication_note: "The pronounced musical talent of his boy was a source of pride to Adam
                        Liszt, who spoke of it to all his friends, so that the little fellow
                        began to be called \x22the artist.\x22 The result was that when a concert
                        was to be given at the neighboring Oldenburg, Adam was requested to
                        allow his wonder child to play.
                        To go back a bit in our composers life story, to an affair of
                        the heart which he experienced in 1868. He became engaged to the
                        well-known singer Desiree Artet; the affair never went further, for
                        what reason is not known. He was not yet thirty, impressionable and
                        intense. Later on, in the year 1877, at the age of thirty-seven, he
                        became a married man. How this happened was doubtless told in his
                        diaries, which were written with great regularity: but unfortunately
                        he destroyed them all a few years before his death. The few facts that
                        have been gleaned from his intimate friend, M. Kashkin, are that he
                        was engaged to the lady in the spring of this year, and married her
                        a month or so afterward. It was evidently a hasty affair and
                        subsequently brought untold suffering to the composer. When
                        the professors of his Conservatoire re-assembled in the autumn,
                        Tschaikowsky appeared among them a married man, but looking the
                        picture of despair. A few weeks later he fled from Moscow, and when
                        next heard of was lying dangerously ill in St. Petersburg. One thing
                        was evident, the ill-considered marriage came very near ruining his
                        life. The doctors ordered rest and change of scene, and his brother
                        Modeste Ilyitch took him to Switzerland and afterward to Italy. The
                        peaceful life and change of scene did much to restore his shattered
                        nerves. Just at this time a wealthy widow lady, Madame von Meek, a
                        great admirer of Tschaikowskys music, learning of his sad condition,
                        settled on him a generous yearly allowance for life. He was now
                        independent and could give his time to composition."

  communication_note: "When Carl was seventeen, the father decided he should go to Vienna,
                        for there he would meet all the great musicians of the time. The
                        boy was at the most impressionable age: he was lively, witty, with
                        pleasant manners and amiable disposition; he soon became a favorite in
                        the highest musical circles. It was a gay life and the inexperienced
                        youth yielded to its allurements. In the meantime he did some serious
                        studying under the famous Abbe Vogler. The following year the Abbe
                        recommended him to the conductorship of the Breslau Opera House. This
                        was a very difficult post for a boy of eighteen, and he encountered
                        much jealousy and opposition from the older musicians, who did not
                        relish finding themselves under the leadership of such a youth. A year
                        served to disgust him with the work and he resigned. During the year
                        he had found time to compose most of his opera \x22Rubezahl.\x22

                        set itself. In thirty years it has created in Paris a little centre of
                        earnest composers of symphonies and chamber-music, and a cultured public
                        that seems able to understand them.

  communication_note: "Richard Strauss is both a poet and a musician. These two natures live
                        together in him, and each strives to get the better of the other. The
                        balance is not always well maintained; but when he does succeed in
                        keeping it by sheer force of will the union of these two talents,
                        directed to the same end, produces an effect more powerful than any
                        known since Wagners time. Both natures have their source in a mind
                        filled with heroic thoughts--a rarer possession, I consider, than a
                        talent for either music or poetry. There are other great musicians in
                        Europe; but Strauss is something more than a great musician, for he is
                        able to create a hero.
                        \x22To follow the impulses of my heart is my supreme law; what I can
                        accomplish by obeying my instincts is what I ought to do. Is that
                        voice of instinct cursed or blessed? I do not know; but I yield to
                        it, and never force myself to run counter to my inclination.\x22
                        Friedhold had initiated him in former days, and he now comes to
                        reproach him for his crime, and to bring him before the Order, who will
                        judge him. In the original version of the poem Guntram complies, and
                        sacrifices his passion to his vow. But while Strauss had been travelling
                        in the East he had conceived a sudden horror for this Christian
                        annihilation of will, and Guntram revolts along with him, and refuses to
                        submit to the rules of his Order. He breaks his lute--a symbol of false
                        hope in the redemption of humanity through faith--and rouses himself
                        from the glorious dreams in which he used to believe, for he sees they
                        are shadows that are scattered by the light of real life. He does not
                        abjure his former vows; but he is not the same man he was when he made
                        them. While his experience was immature he was able to believe that a
                        man ought to submit himself to rules, and that life should be governed
                        by laws. A single hour has enlightened him. Now he is free and
                        alone--alone with his spirit. \x22I alone can lessen my suffering; I alone
                        can expiate my crime. Through myself alone God speaks to me; to me alone
                        God speaks. _Ewig einsam_.\x22 It is the proud awakening of individualism,
                        the powerful pessimism of the Super-man. Such an expression of feeling
                        gives the character of action to renouncement and even to negation
                        itself, for it is a strong affirmation of the will.
                        It was the _Symphonie funebre et triomphale_ for two orchestras and a
                        choir, and the _Te Deum_ for orchestra, organ, and three choirs, which
                        Berlioz loved (whose finale _Judex crederis_ seemed to him the most
                        effective thing he had ever written[99]), as well as the _Imperiale_,
                        for two orchestras and two choirs, and the famous _Requiem_, with its
                        \x22four orchestras of brass instruments, placed round the main orchestra
                        and the mass of voices, but separated and answering one another at a
                        distance.\x22 Like the _Requiem_, these compositions are often crude in
                        style and of rather commonplace sentiment, but their grandeur is
                        overwhelming. This is not due only to the hugeness of the means
                        employed, but also to \x22the breadth of the style and to the formidable
                        slowness of some of the progressions--whose final aim one cannot
                        guess--which gives these compositions a strangely gigantic
                        character.\x22[100] Berlioz has left in these compositions striking
                        examples of the beauty that may reveal itself in a crude mass of music.
                        Like the towering Alps, they move one by their very immensity. A German
                        critic says: \x22In these Cyclopean works the composer lets the elemental
                        and brute forces of sound and pure rhythm have their fling.\x22[101] It is
                        scarcely music, it is the force of Nature herself. Berlioz himself calls
                        his _Requiem_ \x22a musical cataclysm.\x22[102]"

                        but the rumors I had heard about the composers preferred seclusion
                        always made me refuse in spite of my great desire to know him. I
                        now had a desire to express the feelings awakened in me, and
                        to communicate to others, by means of articles and lectures, my
                        admiration for, and my belief in, the composer and his work. The
                        result was that one day, in 1906, Debussy let me know through
                        a friend, that he would like to see me. From that day began our
                        friendship.\x22
                        In spite of Italian opposition which still continued, Webers efforts
                        to establish German opera kept right on, until at last it became a
                        State institution, and the composer was appointed musical director for
                        life. With this bright prospect in view he was able to wed his beloved
                        Caroline. They were married on November 4. A quotation from his diary
                        shows the talented musician had become a serious, earnest man. \x22May
                        God bless our union, and grant me strength and power to make my
                        beloved Lina as happy and contented as my inmost heart would desire.
                        May His mercy lead me in all things.\x22
                        In 1871, the Hungarian Cabinet created him a noble, with a yearly
                        pension of three thousand dollars. In 1875, he was made Director of
                        the Academy at Budapest. In addition, Liszt was a member of nearly all
                        the European Orders of Chivalry.
                        There was now another bond between them, the sympathy over the loss
                        of their dear ones. The Count had requested that the lessons should be
                        resumed. But when the young teacher remained too long in converse with
                        his pupil after the lessons, he was dismissed by the Count, and all
                        their sweet intercourse came to an abrupt end."

                        produced there. Handel returned to Germany the following year. The
                        Elector of Hanover was kind to him, and offered him the post of
                        Capellmeister, with a salary of about fifteen hundred dollars. He
                        had long desired to visit England, and the Elector gave him leave of

                        old teacher. We can imagine the joy of the meeting, and how proud and
                        happy both were at the success of the young musician. After a little
                        time spent with his dear ones, he set out for England."

                        In May, 1905, the first musical festival of Alsace-Lorraine took place
                        at Strasburg. It was an important artistic event, and meant the bringing
                        together of two civilisations that for centuries had been at variance on
                        the soil of Alsace, more anxious for dispute than for mutual
                        understanding.
                        One fine morning in October, 1808, Franz in his homespun grey suit,
                        spectacles shielding his bright, near-sighted eyes, his bushy
                        black hair covered by an old fashioned hat, presented himself for
                        examination by the Court Capellmeister and the singing master. The
                        other boys jeered at his odd appearance, but he kept his good humor.
                        When his turn came to sing, after solving all the problems given, his
                        singing of the trial pieces was so astonishing that he was passed in
                        at once, and ordered to put on the uniform of the imperial choristers."

  communication_note: "Five years later, during his last illness, a collection of some sixty
                        of Schuberts songs was placed in his hands. He turned them over and
                        over with amazement and delight. \x22Truly Schubert has the divine fire,\x22
                        he exclaimed. He wanted to see the composer of such beautiful music.
                        Schubert came and was allowed to have a talk with him first, before
                        other friends who were waiting. When Schubert paid another visit to
                        the bedside of the master, it was almost the end of his life, though
                        he could recognize all who stood about him. Overcome with emotion,
                        Schubert left the room.
                        He pounded away by the hour, the day and the week, while Koussevitzky
                        conducted, watching himself in a set of three tall mirrors in a corner
                        of the drawing room of his Moscow home.
                        \x22This final admonition was of tremendous importance to me; there
                        was something in it like a sanctification. When disappointment and
                        bitterness are in store for me, I shall recall his words, and the
                        remembrance of that hour will have a wonderful power to uphold me in
                        days of adversity.\x22
                        \x22At the close of the year 33, a number of musicians, mostly young,
                        met in Leipsic every evening, apparently by accident at first, but
                        really for the interchange of ideas on all musical subjects. One day
                        the young hot heads exclaimed: Why do we look idly on? Lets take
                        hold and make things better. Thus the new Journal for music began."

  communication_subject: "At first \x22there was feverish excitement; the veins beat violently and tears flowed freely."
  communication_note: "But Berlioz was already getting old. His daily cares and stormy domestic
                        life,[61] his disappointments and passions, his commonplace and often
                        degrading work, soon wore him out and, finally, exhausted his power.
                        \x22Would you believe it?\x22 he wrote to his friend Ferrand, \x22that which used
                        to stir me to transports of musical passion now fills me with
                        indifference, or even disdain. I feel as if I were descending a mountain
                        at a great rate. Life is so short; I notice that thoughts of the end
                        have been with me for some time past.\x22 In 1848, at forty-five years old,
                        he wrote in his _Memoires_: \x22I find myself so old and tired and lacking
                        inspiration.\x22 At forty-five years old, Wagner had patiently worked out
                        his theories and was feeling his power; at forty-five he was writing
                        _Tristan_ and _The Music of the Future_. Abused by critics, unknown to
                        the public, \x22he remained calm, in the belief that he would be master of
                        the musical world in fifty years time.\x22[62]
                        It is through this heroic side that he may be considered as an inheritor
                        of some of Beethovens and Wagners thought. It is this heroic side
                        which makes him a poet--one of the greatest perhaps in modern Germany,
                        who sees herself reflected in him and in his hero. Let us consider this
                        hero.
                        I have said that Berlioz had a matchless gift for expressing tragic
                        melancholy, weariness of life, and the pangs of death. In a general way,
                        one may say that he was a great elegist in music. Ambros, who was a very
                        discerning and unbiassed critic, said: \x22Berlioz feels with inward
                        delight and profound emotion what no musician, except Beethoven, has
                        felt before.\x22 And Heinrich Heine had a keen perception of Berliozs
                        originality when he called him \x22a colossal nightingale, a lark the size
                        of an eagle.\x22 The simile is not only picturesque, but of remarkable
                        aptness. For Berliozs colossal force is at the service of a forlorn and
                        tender heart; he has nothing of the heroism of Beethoven, or Haendel, or
                        Gluck, or even Schubert. He has all the charm of an Umbrian painter, as
                        is shown in _LEnfance du Christ_, as well as sweetness and inward
                        sadness, the gift of tears, and an elegiac passion."

  communication_note: "After his father left him, Robert found he must make a choice of a
                        profession. His mother had set her heart on his making a study of law,
                        while his heart was set on music. Yielding to her wishes for a time he
                        went to Leipsic in March 1828 to prepare to enter the University as
                        a student of law. He also gained consent to study piano at the same
                        time, and began lessons with Frederick Wieck. The desire to study with
                        Wieck was inspired by the piano playing of his little daughter, Clara,
                        then nine years old, who had already gained a considerable degree of
                        musical culture and promised to make her mark as a pianist.
                        He sprang to the piano and began to play. The small fingers could not
                        master the more intricate parts, but gave sufficient idea of how he
                        intended the piece to sound.
                        From this shock he never seemed to rally, though at intervals for a
                        while, he still composed. His death occurred November 4, 1847. It
                        can be said of him that his was a beautiful life, in which \x22there was
                        nothing to tell that was not honorable to his memory and profitable to
                        all men.\x22"

                        Teplitz and Dresden. A couple of days were spent in each, and then the

                        Time does not exist for Don Perosi. When he courteously wished to praise
                        French musicians, the first name he chose--as if it were that of a
                        contemporary--was that of Josquin, and then that of Roland de Lassus,
                        who seems to him so great and profound a musician that he admires him
                        most of all. And Don Perosis universality of style is a trait that is
                        Catholic as well as Italian. He expresses his mind quite clearly on the
                        subject. \x22Great artists formerly,\x22 he says, \x22were more eclectic than
                        ourselves, and less fettered by their nationalities. Josquins school
                        has peopled all Europe. Roland has lived in Flanders, in Italy, and in
                        Germany. With them the same style expressed the same thought everywhere.
                        We must do as they did. We must try to recreate a universal art in which
                        the resources of all countries and all times are blended.\x22"

                        This _Romeo_ is an extraordinary work: \x22a wonderful isle, where a temple
                        of pure art is set up.\x22 For my part, not only do I consider it equal to
                        the most powerful of Wagners creations, but I believe it to be richer
                        in its teaching and in its resources for art--resources and teaching
                        which contemporary French art has not yet fully turned to account. One
                        knows that for several years the young French school has been making
                        efforts to deliver our music from German models, to create a language of
                        recitative that shall belong to France and that the _leitmotif_ will not
                        overwhelm; a more exact and less heavy language, which in expressing the
                        freedom of modern thought will not have to seek the help of the
                        classical or Wagnerian forms. Not long ago, the _Schola Cantorum_
                        published a manifesto that proclaimed \x22the liberty of musical
                        declamation ... free speech in free music ... the triumph of natural
                        music with the free movement of speech and the plastic rhythm of the
                        ancient dance\x22--thus declaring war on the metrical art of the last three
                        centuries.[84]"

  communication_note: "Thus passed two or three busy years. Part of the time Schumann had
                        a room in the house of his teacher Wieck and thus was thrown more or
                        less in the society of Clara Wieck, now a young girl of thirteen or
                        fourteen. Later he gave up his room--though not his intimate relations
                        with the family--and moved to a summer residence in Riedels Garden,
                        where he spent the days in music and the evenings with his friends.
                        The sympathetic program director also had the shattered platinum watch
                        put together by what must have been a Toscanini among watchmakers. By
                        that time the incident had become such a joke that the orchestra
                        men dared to give the Maestro a chain, of material and construction
                        guaranteed to be unbreakable, to attach the brace of Ingersolls to the
                        dark, roomy jacket which for years he has worn at rehearsals.
                        It is not by any means the oldest and most celebrated musical
                        institutions which have taken the largest share in this evolution of
                        music in the last thirty years."

  communication_note: "Mendelssohns funeral was imposing. The first portion was solemnized
                        at Leipsic, attended by crowds of musicians and students, one of the
                        latter bearing on a cushion a silver crown presented by his pupils of
                        the Conservatory. Beside the crown rested the Order \x22Pour le Merite,\x22
                        conferred on him by the King of Prussia. The band, during the long
                        procession, played the E minor \x22Song without Words,\x22 and at the close
                        of the service the choir sang the final chorus from Bachs \x22Passion.\x22
                        The same night the body was taken to Berlin and placed in the family
                        plot in the old Dreifaltigkeit Kirch-hof, beside that of his devoted
                        sister Fanny.
                        Of the composers two brothers, one had passed away and had left his
                        boy Carl, named after himself, as a solemn charge, to be brought up by
                        Uncle Ludwig as his own son. The composer took up this task generously
                        and unselfishly. He was happy to have the little lad near him, one of
                        his own kin to love. But as Carl grew to young manhood he proved to
                        be utterly unworthy of all this affection. He treated his good uncle
                        shamefully, stole money from him, though he had been always generously
                        supplied with it, and became a disgrace to the family. There is no
                        doubt that his nephews dissolute habits saddened the masters life,
                        estranged him from his friends and hastened his death.
                        Nothing is truer. The _Societe Nationale_ is indeed a guest-chamber,
                        where for the past thirty years a guest-chamber art and guest-chamber
                        opinions have been formed; and from it some of the profoundest and most
                        poetic French music has been derived, such as Francks and Debussys
                        chamber-music. But its atmosphere is becoming daily more rarefied. That
                        is a danger. It is to be feared that this art and thought may be
                        absorbed by the decadent subtleties or pedantic scholasticism which is
                        apt to accompany all coteries--in short, that its music will be
                        salon-music rather than chamber-music. Even the Society itself seems to
                        have felt this at times; and at different periods has sought contact
                        with the general public, and put itself into direct communication with
                        it. \x22It becomes more and more necessary,\x22 wrote M. Saint-Saens, \x22that
                        French composers should find something intermediate between an intimate
                        hearing of their music and a performance of it before the general
                        public--something which would not be a speculative thing like a big
                        concert, but which would be analogous to the artistic attraction of an
                        exhibition of painting, and which would dare everything. It is a new aim
                        for the _Societe Nationale_.\x22 But it does not seem that it has yet
                        attained this goal, nor that it is near attaining it, despite some not
                        quite happy attempts.
                        But apart from all these reasons that make the work important in the
                        history of opera, there are purely musical reasons for its success,
                        which are of deeper significance still.[200] _Pelleas et Melisande_ has
                        brought about a reform in the dramatic music of France. This reform is
                        concerned with several things, and, first of all, with recitative."

  communication_note: "He remained some time in Florence and composed the opera \x22Rodrigo,\x22
                        which was performed with great success. While in Venice he brought
                        out another opera, \x22Agrippina,\x22 which had even greater success. Rome
                        delighted him especially and he returned for a second time in 1709.
                        Here he composed his first oratorio, the \x22Resurrection,\x22 which was
                        produced there. Handel returned to Germany the following year. The
                        Elector of Hanover was kind to him, and offered him the post of
                        Capellmeister, with a salary of about fifteen hundred dollars. He
                        had long desired to visit England, and the Elector gave him leave of
                        absence. First, however, he went to Halle to see his mother and his
                        old teacher. We can imagine the joy of the meeting, and how proud and
                        happy both were at the success of the young musician. After a little
                        time spent with his dear ones, he set out for England.
                        And now back in Paris, at the treadmill of writing again. Berlioz had
                        the sort of mentality which could plan, and also execute, big musical
                        enterprises on a grand scale. It was proposed that he and Strauss
                        should give a couple of monster concerts in the Exhibition Building.
                        He got together a body of 1022 performers, all paid except the singers
                        from the lyric theaters, who volunteered to help for the love of
                        music.
                        The strain of the production of \x22Euryanthe\x22 told severely on the
                        composers delicate health, and he returned to Dresden in an exhausted
                        state. There was no rest for him here, as official duties were
                        pressing. The malady afflicting his lungs had made rapid progress and
                        he began to fear he should not be long spared to his wife and little
                        ones.
                        At SantAgata the master lived a quiet, retired life. The estate was
                        situated about two miles from Busseto, and was very large, with a
                        great park, a large collection of horses and other live stock. The
                        residence was spacious, and the masters special bedroom was on the
                        first floor. It was large, light and airy and luxuriously furnished.
                        Here stood a magnificent grand piano, and the composer often rose in
                        the night to jot down the themes which came to him in the silence of
                        the midnight hours. Here \x22Don Carlos\x22 was written. In one of the upper
                        rooms stood the old spinet that Verdi hacked at as a child."

  communication_note: "A touching episode, told in his vivid way, was the meeting, late in
                        life, with his adored Estelle of the pink shoes. He called on her and
                        found a quiet widow, who had lost both husband and children. They
                        had a poignant hour of reminiscence and corresponded for some time

                        up for himself in a home of his own. Of course he had now to work
                        twice as hard, get new pupils and give many more lessons. But with all
                        this extra labor, he made a resolve, which he always kept sacredly,
                        which was to reserve an hour or two each day for composition, or for
                        the study of such musical and literary works as would improve and
                        elevate his mind. Nothing was ever allowed to interfere with this
                        resolution, and to it we owe all his great works."

                        scarcely written more than a few notes.\x22 These later years had been

                        Not only do you get no help from Berlioz in this way, but he is the

                        understand his genius you must seize hold of it unaided. His genius was

                        \x22On Thursday, 9 December, at half-past ten, I saw Richard Wagner
                        for the second time at the Hotel Imperial, where I stayed for half
                        an hour on the staircase, awaiting his arrival (I knew that on that
                        day he would conduct the last rehearsal of his _Lohengrin_). At
                        last the master came down from the second floor, and I bowed to him
                        very respectfully while he was yet some distance from me. He
                        thanked me in a very friendly way. As he neared the door I sprang
                        forward and opened it for him, upon which he looked fixedly at me
                        for a few seconds, and then went on his way to the rehearsal at
                        the Opera. I ran as fast as I could, and arrived at the Opera
                        sooner than Richard Wagner did in his cab. I bowed to him again,
                        and I wanted to open the door of his cab for him; but as I could
                        not get it open, the coachman jumped down from his seat and did it
                        for me. Wagner said something to the coachman--I think it was about
                        me. I wanted to follow him into the theatre, but they would not let
                        me pass."

  communication_note: "The father of this beloved composer was a Frenchman, born in Nancy,
                        Lorraine, in 1770, the same year Beethoven saw the light in Bonn. He
                        was carefully brought up, well-bred and well-educated. When a friend
                        of his in Warsaw, Poland, in the tobacco and snuff trade, then in high
                        repute with the nobility, needed help with his book-keeping, he sent
                        for the seventeen-year-old lad. Thus it happened that Nicholas Chopin
                        came to Warsaw in 1787. It was a time of unrest, when the nation was
                        struggling for liberty and independence. The young man applied himself
                        to master the language, and study the character and needs of his
                        adopted country, that he might be well informed. During the period of
                        insecurity in political affairs, the tobacco factory had to be closed
                        and Nicholas Chopin looked for other activity. A few years later we
                        find him in the household of Countess Skarbek, as a tutor to her son,
                        Frederic. Here he met his bride, Justina de Krzyzanowska, a young
                        lady of noble but poor family, whom he married in 1806. She became the
                        mother of his four children, three girls and a boy."

                        Let us take one more glimpse of our beloved composer. It was the
                        morning of August 26, 1846. The Town Hall of Birmingham, England,
                        was filled with an expectant throng, for today the composer of the
                        \x22Elijah\x22 was to conduct his greatest work, for the first time before
                        an English audience. When Mendelssohn stepped upon the platform, he
                        was greeted by a deafening shout; the reception was overwhelming, and
                        at the close the entire audience sprang to its feet in a frenzy of
                        admiration. He wrote to his brother Paul that evening: \x22No work of
                        mine ever went so admirably at the first performance, or was received
                        with such enthusiasm both by musicians and public.\x22 During April the
                        following year, four performances of the \x22Elijah\x22 took place in Exeter
                        Hall, the composer conducting, the Queen and Prince Albert being
                        present on the second occasion. This visit to England which was to be
                        his last, had used his strength to the limit of endurance, and there
                        was a shadow of a coming breakdown. Soon after he rejoined his family
                        in Frankfort, his sister Fanny suddenly passed away in Berlin.
                        The news was broken to him too quickly, and with a shriek he fell
                        unconscious to the floor.
                        Five years the boy Franz Schubert remained at the Convict School and
                        as he had decided to give himself entirely to music, there was no
                        reason for his remaining longer in the school. At the end of the year
                        1813, he left, and his departure was celebrated by the composition of
                        his first Symphony, in honor of Dr. Lang, the musical director. The
                        lad, now seventeen, stood at the beginning of his career; he was full
                        of hope and energy, and determined to follow in the footsteps of the
                        great masters of music. Of all his compositions so far produced, his
                        songs seemed to be the most spontaneous. He probably did not guess
                        that he was to open up new paths in this field.
                        The noble manager made a good offer too, and Gluck felt he ought to
                        accept. He reached London in 1745, but owing to the rebellion which
                        had broken out in Scotland all the theaters were closed, and the city
                        in more or less confusion. However a chance to hear the famous German
                        composer, who had traveled such a distance, was not to be lost, and
                        Lord Middlesex besought the Powers to re-open the theater. After much
                        pleading his request was finally granted. The opening opera, written
                        on purpose to introduce Gluck to English audiences, was entitled \x22La
                        Caduta del Giganti,\x22--\x22Fall of the Giants\x22--and did not seem to please
                        the public. But the young composer was undaunted. His next opera,
                        \x22Artamene,\x22 pleased them no better. The mind of the people was taken
                        up at that period with politics and political events, and they cared
                        less than usual for music and the arts. Then, too, Handel, at the
                        height of his fame, was living in London, honored and courted by the
                        aristocracy and the world of fashion."

  communication_note: "In later years, however, the _Societe des Concerts_, with M. Marty,
                        began to consider new works. Its orchestra, composed of eminent
                        instrumentalists, enjoys a classical fame; though it is now no longer
                        alone in the excellence of its performances, and has perhaps lost a
                        little the secret that it claimed to possess for the interpretation of
                        great classical works. It excels in works of a neo-classic character,
                        like those of M. Saint-Saens, which are stronger in style and taste than
                        in life and passion. The Conservatoire concerts have also a relative
                        superiority over other concerts in Paris in the performance of choral
                        works, which up to the present have been very second-rate. But these
                        concerts are not easy of access for the general public, as the number of
                        seats for sale is very limited. And so the society is representative of
                        a little public whose taste is, broadly speaking, conservative and
                        official; and the noise of the strife outside its doors only reaches its
                        ears slowly, and with a deadened sound."

                        important works, and are two works about which one may feel very
                        differently. For my part, I am very fond of the one, and I dislike the
                        other; but both of them open up two great new roads in art, and both are
                        placed like two gigantic arches on the triumphal way of the revolution
                        that Berlioz started. I will return to the subject of these works later."

  communication_note: "The political events of 1848 brought him back to Weimar, and he
                        resumed his post of Court Music Director. He now directed his energies
                        toward making Weimar the first musical city of Germany. Greatly
                        admiring Wagners genius, he undertook to perform his works in Weimar,
                        and to spread his name and fame. Indeed it is not too much to say that
                        without Liszts devoted efforts, Wagner would never have attained his
                        vogue and fame. Wagner himself testified to this.
                        \x22I asked the master whether I should ever be able really to do
                        anything, and he said to me: When I was your age and composing
                        music, no one could tell me then whether I should ever do anything
                        great. You could at most play me your compositions on the piano;
                        but I have no time to hear them. When you are older, and when you
                        have composed bigger works, and if by chance I return to Vienna,
                        you shall show me what you have done. But that is no use now; I
                        cannot give you an opinion of them yet.
                        I have mentioned this little incident partly because my views were
                        shared by many Alsatians in the audience, who expressed their annoyance
                        to me afterwards. But, putting it aside, our French artists ought not to
                        have consented to let our music be represented by a mutilated score of
                        _Les Beatitudes_ and by Charpentiers _Impressions dItalie_, for the
                        latter, though a brilliantly clever work, is not of the first rank, and
                        was too easily crushed by one of Wagners most stupendous compositions.
                        If people wish to institute a joust between French and German art, let
                        it be a fair one, I repeat; let Wagner be matched with Berlioz, and
                        Strauss with Debussy, and Mahler with Dukas or Magnard."

  communication_note: "Verdi spent most of his evenings at the home of the master, when
                        Lavigna was not at La Scala and there met many artists. One night it
                        chanced that Lavigna, Basili and Verdi were alone, and the two masters
                        were speaking of the deplorable result of a competition for the
                        position of Maetre di Capelle and organist of the Church of San
                        Giovanni di Monza. Out of twenty-eight young men who had taken part
                        in the competition, not one had known how to develop correctly the
                        subject given by Basili for the construction of a fugue. Lavigna, with
                        a bit of mischief in his eyes, began to say to his friend:--\x22It is
                        really a remarkable fact. Well, look at Verdi, who has studied fugue
                        for two short years. I lay a wager he would have done better than your
                        eight and twenty candidates.\x22
                        One may see by this short account what a heterogeneous work it is. Two
                        or three quite different worlds are brought into it: the realism of the
                        bourgeois characters of Vitas mother and lover is mixed up with
                        symbolisms of Christianity, represented by the Stranger, and with the
                        fairy-tale of the magic emerald and the voices of the ocean. This
                        complexity, which is evident enough in the poem, is even more evident in
                        the music, where a union of different arts and different ideas is
                        attempted. We get the art of the folk-song, religious art, the art of
                        Wagner, the art of Franck, as well as a note of familiar realism (which
                        is something akin to the Italian _opera-bouffe_) and descriptions of
                        sensation that are quite personal. As there are only two short acts, the
                        rapidity of the action only serves to accentuate this impression. The
                        changes are very abrupt: we are hurried from a world of human beings to
                        a world of abstract ideas, and then taken from an atmosphere of religion
                        to a land of fairies. The work is, however, clear enough from a musical
                        point of view. The more complex the elements that M. dIndy gathers
                        round him the more anxious he is to bring them into harmony. It is a
                        difficult task, and is only possible when the different elements are
                        reduced to their simplest expression and brought down to their
                        fundamental qualities--thus depriving them of the spice of their
                        individuality. M. dIndy puts different styles and ideas on the anvil,
                        and then forges them vigorously. It is natural that here and there we
                        should see the mark of the hammer, the imprint of his determination; but
                        it is only by his determination that he welded the work into a solid
                        whole.

                        This retirement was interrupted in 1844, by a long concert tour
                        planned by Clara. She was firmly decided to go and made Robert
                        solemnly promise to accompany her to St. Petersburg. He was loath
                        to leave the quiet he loved, but it had to be done. Clara had great
                        success everywhere, as a pianist, giving many recitals during their
                        travels from place to place. From Russia the artist pair went to
                        Helsingfors, Stockholm and Copenhagen. They started on their tour in
                        January and did not reach home till the first of June."

                        In the shadows of the studio that afternoon lurked John F. Royal,
                        program director of NBC. Next day he presented the Maestro with two $1
                        watches, both inscribed, \x22For Rehearsals Only.\x22 Mr. Toscanini was so
                        amused that he forgot to get angry with Mr. Royal for breaking
                        the grimly enforced rule barring all but orchestra members from
                        rehearsals.
                        He possessed not only talent but perseverance and the will to succeed.
                        The violoncello attracted him, and he began to teach himself to play
                        it, with no other help than an old instruction book. Determination
                        conquered many difficulties however, and before long he had made
                        sufficient progress to enable him to join a troop of traveling
                        minstrels. From Prague they made their way to Vienna.
                        Perfect eclecticism had been exercised in the making up of the
                        programme. One found mixed together the names of Mozart, Wagner, and
                        Brahms; Cesar Franck and Gustave Charpentier; Richard Strauss and
                        Mahler. There were French singers like Cazeneuve and Daraux, and French
                        and Italian virtuosi like Henri Marteau and Ferruccio Busoni, together
                        with German, Austrian, and Scandinavian artists. The orchestra (the
                        _Strassbuerger Staedtische Orchester_) and the choir, which was formed of
                        different _Chorvereine_ of Strasburg, were conducted by Richard Strauss,
                        Gustav Mahler, and Camille Chevillard. But the names of these famous
                        _Kapellmeister_ must not let us forget the man who was really the soul
                        of the concerts--Professor Ernst Muench, of Strasburg, an Alsatian, who
                        conducted all the rehearsals, and who effaced himself at the last
                        moment, and left all the honours to the conductors of foreign
                        orchestras. Professor Muench, who is also organist at Saint-Guillaume,
                        has done more than anyone else for music in Strasburg, and has trained
                        excellent choirs (the \x22_Choeurs de Saint-Guillaume_\x22) there, and
                        organised splendid concerts of Bachs music with the aid of another
                        Alsatian, Albert Schweitzer, whose name is well known to musical
                        historians. The latter is director of the clerical college of St. Thomas
                        (_Thomasstift_), a pastor, an organist, a professor at the University of
                        Strasburg, and the author of interesting works on theology and
                        philosophy. Besides this he has written a now famous book,
                        _Jean-Sebastien Bach_, which is doubly remarkable: first, because it is
                        written in French (though it was published in Leipzig by a professor of
                        the University of Strasburg), and secondly, because it shows an
                        harmonious blend of the French and German spirit, and gives fresh life
                        to the study of Bach and the old classic art. It was very interesting to
                        me to make the acquaintance of these people, born on Alsatian soil, and
                        representing the best Alsatian culture and all that was finest in the
                        two civilisations."

  communication_note: "Lavigna was a former pupil of the Conservatoire of Naples and an able
                        composer. Verdi showed him some of the same compositions he had shown
                        Basili. After examining them he willingly accepted the young aspirant
                        as a pupil.
                        The next great work undertaken by Berlioz was the Requiem. It seems
                        that, in 1836, the French Minister of the Interior set aside yearly,
                        3,000 francs to be given to a native composer, chosen by the Minister,
                        to compose a religious work, either a mass or an oratorio, to be
                        performed at the expense of the Government.
                        Zelter was found seated at his instrument, enveloped by a cloud of
                        smoke from a long stemmed pipe. Devrient unfolded the plan of bringing
                        this great work of Bach to the knowledge of the public. The old man
                        listened to their plea with growing impatience, until he became quite
                        excited, rose from his chair and paced the floor with great strides,
                        exclaiming, \x22No, it is not to be thought of--it is a mad scheme.\x22 To
                        Felix argument then seemed useless and he beckoned his friend to
                        come away, but Devrient refused to move, and kept up his persuasive
                        argument. Finally, as though a miracle had been wrought, Zelter began
                        to weaken, and at last gave in, and besides promised all the aid in
                        his power.
                        Though I wished very much to admire the work of a composer whom I held
                        in such esteem, I felt it did not come out very well from the test. To
                        begin with, this symphony is excessively long--it lasts an hour and a
                        half--though there is no apparent justification for its proportions. It
                        aims at being colossal, and mainly achieves emptiness. The _motifs_ are
                        more than familiar. After a funeral march of commonplace character and
                        boisterous movement, where Beethoven seems to be taking lessons from
                        Mendelssohn, there comes a scherzo, or rather a Viennese waltz, where
                        Chabrier gives old Bach a helping hand. The adagietto has a rather sweet
                        sentimentality. The rondo at the end is presented rather like an idea of
                        Francks, and is the best part of the composition; it is carried out in
                        a spirit of mad intoxication and a chorale rises up from it with
                        crashing joy; but the effect of the whole is lost in repetitions that
                        choke it and make it heavy. Through all the work runs a mixture of
                        pedantic stiffness and incoherence; it moves along in a desultory way,
                        and suffers from abrupt checks in the course of its development and from
                        superfluous ideas that break in for no reason at all, with the result
                        that the whole hangs fire."

                        Tschaikowskys opera, \x22Mazeppa,\x22 was his next important work. In the

                        followed. Two Symphonic Poems, \x22Manfred\x22 and \x22Hamlet\x22 came next. The
                        latter of these was written at the composers country house, whose
                        purchase had been made possible by the generosity of his benefactress,

                        country life. He had purchased the old manor house of Frovolo, on the
                        outskirts of the town of Klin, near Moscow. Here his two beautiful
                        ballets and two greatest Symphonies, the Fifth and Sixth, were
                        written. The Fifth Symphony was composed in 1888 and published the
                        next year. On its first hearing it made little impression and was
                        scarcely heard again till Nikisch, with unerring judgment, rescued it
                        from neglect; then the world discovered it to be one of the composers
                        greatest works."

                        One of the first works written after his return to Paris, was a
                        musical setting to the Biblical story of \x22Ruth.\x22 The work was given
                        in the concert room of the Conservatoire, on January 4, 1846, when the
                        youthful composer was twenty-three. The majority of the critics
                        found little to praise in the music, which, they said, was but a poor
                        imitation of \x22Le Desert,\x22 by David. One critic, more kindly disposed
                        than the others, said: \x22M. Cesar Franck is exceedingly naeve, and this
                        simplicity we must confess, has served him well in the composition of
                        his sacred oratorio of Ruth.\x22 A quarter of a century later, a second
                        performance of \x22Ruth\x22 was given, and the same critic wrote: \x22It is
                        a revelation! This score, which recalls by its charm and melodic
                        simplicity Mehuls Joseph, but with more tenderness and modern
                        feeling, is certainly a masterpiece.\x22
                        He is never satisfied with himself. Some years ago, when he was still
                        conducting at the Scala in Milan, he came home one night after the
                        opera. Mr. Toscanini does not eat before a performance, and his family
                        wait with the evening meal until he joins them."

  communication_note: "It is not, however, Perosis dramatic genius that strikes me in his
                        work; it is rather his peculiar mournfulness, which is indescribable,
                        his gift of pure poetry, and the richness of his flowing melody. However
                        deep the religious feeling in the music may be, the music itself is
                        often stronger still, and breaks in upon the drama that it may express
                        itself freely. Take, for instance, the fine symphonic passage that
                        follows the arrival of Jesus and His friends at Martha and Marys house,
                        after the death of their brother (p. 12 _et seq._ of _Lazarus_). It is
                        true the orchestra expresses regrets and sighs, the excesses of sorrow
                        mingled with words of consolation and faith, in a sort of languishing
                        funeral march that is feminine and Christian in character. This,
                        according to the composer, is a picture he has painted of the persons in
                        the drama before he makes them speak. But, in spite of himself, the
                        result is a flood of pure music, and his soul sings its own song of joy
                        and sadness. Sometimes his spirit, in its naive and delicate charm,
                        recalls that of Mozart; but his musical visions are always dominated and
                        directed by a religious strength like that of Bach. Even the portions
                        where the dramatic feeling is strongest are really little symphonies,
                        such as the music that describes the miracle in _The Transfiguration_,
                        and the illness of Lazarus. In the latter great depth of suffering is
                        expressed; indeed, sadness could not have been carried farther even by
                        Bach, and the same serenity of mind runs through its despair.
                        The following year he returned to Moscow and seemed quite his natural
                        self. A fever of energy for work took possession of him. He began a
                        new opera, \x22Eugen Onegin,\x22 and completed his Fourth Symphony, in F
                        minor. The score of the opera was finished in February, 1878, and
                        sent at once to Moscow, where the first performance was given in March
                        1879. In the beginning the opera had only a moderate success, but
                        gradually grew in favor till, after five years, it was performed
                        in St. Petersburg and had an excellent reception. It is considered
                        Tschaikowskys most successful opera, sharing with Glinkas \x22Life of
                        the Tsar\x22 the popularity of Russian opera. In 1881 he was invited
                        to compose an orchestral work for the consecration of the Temple of
                        Christ in Moscow. The \x22Solemn Overture 1812,\x22 Op. 49, was the outcome
                        of this. Later in the year he completed the Second Piano Concerto.
                        The Piano Trio in A minor, \x22To the memory of a great artist,\x22 Op.
                        50, refers to his friend and former master, Nicholas Rubinstein, who
                        passed away in Paris, in 1881.
                        Meanwhile--and please dont lose sight of this cardinal fact--he made
                        transcendently beautiful music. His stature as a conductor grew
                        with the years and so did the repertoire of scores he conducted from
                        memory. This feat involved heartbreaking work, for his memory, while
                        good, is not unusually retentive. In the middle years of his career,
                        he devoted from ten to twelve hours a day to studying scores.
                        August Schumann was more and more convinced that Providence had
                        intended his son to become a musician, and though the mother struggled
                        against it, he resolved to see that Robert had a musical education.
                        Carl Maria von Weber, then living in Dresden, was written to, and

                        came to anything however, for what reason is not known. The boy was
                        left now to direct his own musical studies, just when he needed an
                        expert guiding hand. He had no rivals in his native town, where he
                        sometimes appeared as a pianist. It was no wonder he thought he was on
                        the right road, and that he tried more than ever to win his mothers
                        consent to his following music as a life work."

  communication_note: "And now sudden sorrow swept over the little family. At the beginning
                        of April one of the little boys fell ill. Before the doctors could
                        understand what was the matter, the little fellow breathed his last
                        in the arms of his desperate mother. A few days after this, the other
                        child sickened and died. In June the young wife, unable to bear the
                        strain, passed away and Verdi saw the third coffin leave his door
                        carrying the last of his dear ones. And in the midst of these crushing
                        trials he was expected to compose a comic opera! But he bravely
                        completed his task. \x22Un Giorno di Regno\x22 naturally proved a dead
                        failure. In the despondency that followed, the composer resolved to
                        give up composition altogether. Merelli scolded him roundly for such
                        a decision, and promised if, some day, he chose to take up his pen
                        again, he would, if given two months notice, produce any opera Verdi
                        might write."

                        vigour, its clearness of form, its virile force and freedom, and the
                        extraordinary healthiness of the hero, and, indeed, of the whole work."

                        The composer now threw himself heart and soul into improving the
                        orchestra placed in his charge. Before long he had drilled it to a
                        high state of excellence. Many new operas were put on the stage in
                        quick succession. Thus Weber worked on with great industry for three
                        years. The success he achieved created enemies, and perhaps because of
                        intrigues, envy and ill feeling which had arisen, he resigned his
                        post in 1816. The three years in Prague had been fruitful in new
                        compositions. Several fine piano sonatas, a set of \x22National Songs,\x22
                        and the Cantata, \x22Kampf und Sieg,\x22 (Struggle and Victory). This last
                        work soon became known all over Germany and made the gifted young
                        composer very popular. During this period Weber became engaged to
                        Caroline Brandt, a charming singer, who created the title rele in his
                        opera of \x22Sylvana.\x22
                        Then a pupil of Francks, M. Henry Expert, who began his admirable works
                        on Musical History in 1882, laid the foundation of the _Societe J.S.
                        Bach_, in order to spread the knowledge of ancient music written between
                        the twelfth and eighteenth centuries. And he succeeded in interesting
                        in his undertaking, not only the principal French musicians, such as
                        Cesar Franck, Saint-Saens, and Gounod, but also foreigners, such as Hans
                        von Buelow, Tschaikowsky, Grieg, Sgambati, and Gevaert. Unhappily this
                        society never got farther than arranging what it wanted to do, and only
                        sketched out the plans that were realised later by Charles Bordes."

                        to teach and compose. Second, to teach musical history and aesthetics.
                        Who does not feel the infectious warmth and beauty of these spirited
                        words? How this force of enthusiasm and sincerity must grip all young

                        in the success of the piece, and really \x22became quite a slave to

                        The name Bach belonged to a long race of musicians, who strove to
                        elevate the growing art of music. For nearly two hundred years there
                        had been organists and composers in the family; Sebastians father,
                        Johann Ambrosius Bach was organist of the Lutheran Church in Eisenach,
                        and naturally a love of music was fostered in the home. It is no
                        wonder that little Sebastian should have shown a fondness for music
                        almost from infancy. But, beyond learning the violin from his father,
                        he had not advanced very far in his studies, when, in his tenth
                        year he lost both his parents and was taken care of by his brother
                        Christoph, fourteen years older, a respectable musician and organist
                        in a neighboring town. To give his little brother lessons on the
                        clavier, and send him to the Lyceum to learn Latin, singing and other
                        school subjects seemed to Christoph to include all that could be
                        expected of him. That his small brother possessed musical genius of
                        the highest order, was an idea he could not grasp; or if he did, he
                        repressed the boy with indifference and harsh treatment."

                        As brighter days dawned, Haydn procured all the works on theory
                        obtainable, and studied them deeply. He had mastered the difficulties
                        of the \x22Gradus,\x22 one of the books purchased years before, and without
                        any outside help had worked out his musical independence, uninfluenced
                        by any other musician. He was now twenty-six, and his fame was
                        growing. Meanwhile an affair of the heart had great influence on his
                        life. Sometime previously Haydn had been engaged to give lessons
                        on the harpsichord to two daughters of a wig-maker named Keller. An
                        attachment soon sprang up between the teacher and the younger of the
                        girls. His poverty had stood in the way of making his feelings known.
                        But as prosperity began to dawn, he grew courageous and asked the
                        maiden to become his wife. His disappointment was keen when he found
                        the girl had in the meantime decided to take the veil. The wig-maker
                        proved to be a matchmaker, for when he learned how matters stood he
                        urged the composer to take the sister, who was only three years older.
                        The gentle Haydn was unable to withstand the pressure brought to bear,
                        and consented. After his bride was his he found he had won a virago,
                        one who cared nothing for art or for her husbands ideals, if only she
                        could have enough money to spend."

                        which was Nannerls real name, soon began to play very well indeed,
                        while little Wolfgang hardly had to be told anything in music, for
                        he seemed to know it already. The father would write Minuets for the
                        little girl to study; her tiny brother would learn them in half an
                        hour. Soon Wolfgang was able to compose his own Minuets. Several have
                        come down to us which he wrote when he was five years old; and they
                        are quite perfect in form and style.
                        Bach always preferred a life of quiet and retirement; simplicity had
                        ever been his chief characteristic. He was always very religious; his
                        greatest works voice the noblest sentiments of exaltation.
                        He likes reading, listening to the radio--he is fond of good jazz--and
                        driving out in the country. He loves speed. An American friend who
                        some years ago accompanied him on a motor trip from Milan to Venice
                        groaned when the speedometer began hovering around 78. \x22Whats the
                        matter with you?\x22 the Maestro wanted to know. \x22Were only jogging
                        along.\x22 Whenever possible he flies.
                        A continual round of functions interspersed with concerts at which he
                        played or conducted, filled the young composers time. The overture to
                        \x22Midsummer Nights Dream\x22 was played several times and always received
                        with enthusiasm. On one occasion a friend was so careless as to leave
                        the manuscript in a hackney coach on his way home and it was lost.
                        \x22Never mind, I will write another,\x22 said Mendelssohn, which he was
                        able to do, without making a single error."

                        dull lifelessness of the choruses, the defective acoustics, and the

                        Edward MacDowell remained in close study at the Frankfort Conservatory
                        for two years, his mother having in the meantime returned to America.
                        He had hoped to obtain a place as professor on the teaching staff of
                        the institution. Failing to do this he took private pupils. One of
                        these, Miss Marian Nevins, he afterwards married. He must have been a
                        rather striking looking youth at this time. He was nineteen. Tall and
                        vigorous, with blue eyes, fair skin, rosy cheeks, very dark hair and
                        reddish mustache, he was called \x22the handsome American.\x22 He seemed
                        from the start, to have success in teaching, though he was painfully
                        shy, and always remained so.
                        For several years the leader of the young school, M. Claude Debussy,
                        has, in his writings in the _Revue Blanche_ and _Gil Blas_, attacked
                        Wagnerian art. His personality is very French--capricious, poetic, and
                        _spirituelle_, full of lively intelligence, heedless, independent,
                        scattering new ideas, giving vent to paradoxical caprice, criticising
                        the opinions of centuries with the teasing impertinence of a little
                        street boy, attacking great heroes of music like Gluck, Wagner, and
                        Beethoven, upholding only Bach, Mozart, and Weber, and loudly professing
                        his preference for the old French masters of the eighteenth century. But
                        in spite of this he is bringing back to French music its true nature and
                        its forgotten ideals--its clearness, its elegant simplicity, its
                        naturalness, and especially its grace and plastic beauty. He wishes
                        music to free itself from all literary and philosophic pretensions,
                        which have burdened German music in the nineteenth century (and perhaps
                        have always done so); he wishes music to get away from the rhetoric
                        which has been handed down to us through the centuries, from its heavy
                        construction and precise orderliness, from its harmonic and rhythmic
                        formulas, and the exercises of oratorical embroidery. He wishes that
                        all about it shall be painting and poetry; that it shall explain its
                        true feeling in a clear and direct way; and that melody, harmony, and
                        rhythm shall develop broadly along the lines of inner laws, and not
                        after the pretended laws of some intellectual arrangement. And he
                        himself preaches by example in his _Pelleas et Melisande_, and breaks
                        with all the principles of the Bayreuth drama, and gives us the model of
                        the new art of his dreams. And on all sides discerning and well-informed
                        critics, such as M. Pierre Lalo of _Le Temps_, M. Louis Laloy of the
                        _Revue Musicale_ and the _Mercure Musicale_, and M. Marnold of _Le
                        Mercure de France_, have championed his doctrines and his art. Even the
                        _Schola Cantorum_, whose eclectic and archaic spirit is very different
                        from that of Debussy, seemed at first to be drawn into the same current
                        of thought; and this school which had so helped to propagate the foreign
                        influences of the past, did not seem to be quite insensible to the
                        nationalistic preoccupation of the last few years. So the _Schola_
                        devoted itself more and more--as was moreover its right and duty--to the
                        French music of the past, and filled its concert programmes with French
                        works of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries--with Marc Antoine
                        Charpentier, Du Mont, Leclair, Clerambault, Couperin, and the French
                        primitive composers for the organ, the harpsichord, and the violin; and
                        with the works of dramatic composers, especially of the great Rameau,
                        who, after a period of complete oblivion, suddenly benefited by this
                        excessive reaction, to the detriment of Gluck, whom the young critics,
                        following M. Debussys example, severely abused.[258] There was even a
                        moment when the _Schola_ took a decided share in the battle, and,
                        through M. Charles Bordes, issued a manifesto--_Credo_, as they called
                        it--about a new art founded on the ancient traditions of French music:"

                        But the main thing was that Wolfs creative genius had returned. In
                        April, 1896, he wrote straight away the twenty-two songs of the second
                        volume of the _Italienisches-Liederbuch_. At Christmas his friend Mueller
                        sent him some of Michelangelos poems, translated into German by Walter
                        Robert-Tornow; and Wolf, deeply moved by their beauty, decided at once
                        to devote a whole volume of _Lieder_ to them. In 1897 he composed the
                        first three melodies. At the same time he was also working at a new
                        opera, _Manuel Venegas_, a poem by Moritz Hoernes, written after the
                        style of Alarcon. He seemed full of strength and happiness and
                        confidence in his renewed health. Mueller was speaking to him of the
                        premature death of Schubert, and Wolf replied, \x22A man is not taken away

                        forcibly trying to reconcile one to the other. For there are some who
                        condemn Berlioz in the name of Wagners theories; and others who, not

                        Wagner may have learnt something from Berlioz, the two composers have
                        nothing in common; their genius and their art are absolutely opposed;
                        each one has ploughed his furrow in a different field.

                        to engage him as accompanist. Haydn gladly accepted at once, hoping to
                        pick up much musical knowledge in this way. Old Porpora was very
                        harsh and domineering at first, treating him more like a valet than
                        a musician. But at last he was won over by Haydns gentleness and
                        patience, until he was willing to answer all his questions and
                        to correct his compositions. Best of all he brought Haydn to the
                        attention of the nobleman in whose house he was teaching, so that
                        when the nobleman and his family went to the baths of Mannersdorf for
                        several months, Haydn was asked to go along as accompanist to Porpora.

                        and wept. In the meantime, the old lady did not understand this

                        Nowhere is Wagner nearer to Beethoven than in _Siegfried_. In _Die
                        Walkuere_ certain characters, certain phrases of Wotan, of Bruennhilde,
                        and, especially, of Siegmund, bear a close relationship to Beethovens
                        symphonies and sonatas. I can never play the recitative _con espressione
                        e semplice_ of the seventeenth sonata for the piano (Op. 31, No. 2)
                        without being reminded of the forests of _Die Walkuere_ and the fugitive
                        hero. But in _Siegfried_ I find, not only a likeness to Beethoven in
                        details, but the same spirit running through the work--both the poem and
                        the music. I cannot help thinking that Beethoven would perhaps have
                        disliked _Tristan_, but would have loved _Siegfried_; for the latter is
                        a perfect incarnation of the spirit of old Germany, virginal and gross,
                        sincere and malicious, full of humour and sentiment, of deep feeling, of
                        dreams of bloody and joyous battles, of the shade of great oak-trees and
                        the song of birds."

                        instrument speak of higher things. Indeed the spirit must speak
                        through the form. This he realized the more as he listened to the
                        thrilling performances of that wizard of the violin, Paganini,
                        who appeared in Paris in 1831. This style of playing made a deep
                        impression on Liszt. He now tried to do on the piano what Paganini
                        accomplished on the violin, in the matter of tone quality and
                        intensity. He procured the newly published Caprices for violin and
                        tried to learn their tonal secrets, also transcribing the pieces for
                        piano.
                        The new opera, \x22Idomeneo,\x22 fulfilled the high expectations his Munich
                        friends had formed of the composers genius. Its reception at the
                        rehearsals proved success was certain, and the Elector who was
                        present, joined the performers in expressing his unqualified approval.
                        At home the progress of the work was followed with deepest interest.
                        The first performance of \x22Idomeneo\x22 took place on January 29, 1781.
                        Leopold and Marianne journeyed to Munich to witness Wolfgangs
                        triumph. It was a proud, happy moment for all three; the enthusiastic
                        acclaim which shook the theater seemed to the old father, who watched
                        with swimming eyes the sea of waving hands around him, to set the seal
                        of greatness on his sons career."

                        economical, as he must pay back the loan made for his mass. He found
                        a tiny fifth floor room, gave up restaurant dinners and contented
                        himself with plain bread, with the addition of raisins, prunes
                        or dates. He also secured some pupils, which helped out in this

                        The child gazed with awe at the great pipes, the keyboard and the
                        pedals. He begged his father to explain their working, and then as
                        the father filled the great bellows the tiny organist pushed aside
                        the organ bench, stood upon the pedals and trod them, as though he had
                        always known how. The monks in the monastery hastened to the chapel,
                        holding their breath as one pointed to the figure of a tiny child in
                        the organ loft. Was it possible, they asked themselves, that a child
                        could produce such beautiful music? They remained rooted to the spot,
                        till Wolfgang happened to see them and crept meekly down from his
                        perch."

                        for musical journals, to keep the wolf from the door, meanwhile
                        working on the score of \x22Rienzi,\x22 which was finished in November, 1840
                        and sent to Dresden. In later years it was produced in that city.
                        The pronounced musical talent of his boy was a source of pride to Adam
                        Liszt, who spoke of it to all his friends, so that the little fellow
                        began to be called \x22the artist.\x22 The result was that when a concert
                        was to be given at the neighboring Oldenburg, Adam was requested to

                        The first lectures on Aesthetics and Musical History were not given in
                        France until after the war of 1870.[238] They were then given at the
                        Conservatoire, and, until quite lately, were the only lectures on Music
                        of any importance in Paris. Since 1878 they have been given in a very
                        excellent way by M. Bourgault-Ducoudray; but, as is only natural in a
                        school of music, their character is artistic rather than scientific, and
                        takes the form of a sort of illustration of the practical work that is
                        done at the Conservatoire. And as for Parisian musical criticism as a
                        whole, it had, thirty years ago, an almost exclusively literary
                        character, and was without technical precision or historical knowledge.

                        Five years the boy Franz Schubert remained at the Convict School and
                        as he had decided to give himself entirely to music, there was no

                        1813, he left, and his departure was celebrated by the composition of
                        his first Symphony, in honor of Dr. Lang, the musical director. The

                        great masters of music. Of all his compositions so far produced, his
                        songs seemed to be the most spontaneous. He probably did not guess

                        for piano and strings, containing three movements, several sonatas for
                        the piano, some songs and a musical comedy in three scenes, for

                        wrote.
                        Soon after he began his professorship in Moscow, he composed a Concert
                        Overture in C minor. To his surprise and disappointment, Rubinstein
                        disapproved of the work in every way. This was a shock, after the lack
                        of encouragement in St. Petersburg. But he recovered his poise, though
                        he made up his mind to try his next work in St. Petersburg instead of
                        Moscow. He called the new piece a Symphonic Poem, \x22Winter Daydreams,\x22
                        but it is now known as the First Symphony, Op. 13. About the end of
                        1866, he started out with it, only to be again rebuffed and cast down.
                        The two men whose good opinion he most desired, Anton Rubinstein and
                        Professor Zaremba, could find nothing good in his latest work, and
                        the young composer returned to Moscow to console himself with renewed
                        efforts in composition. Two years later the \x22Winter Daydreams\x22
                        Symphony was produced in Moscow with great success, and its author
                        was much encouraged by this appreciation. He was, like most composers,
                        very sensitive to criticism and had a perfect dread of controversy.
                        Efforts to engage him in arguments of this sort only made him withdraw
                        into himself.

                        to-day as when it was written, and the \x22Michael of Music\x22 speaks to us
                        still in his operas, whenever they are adequately performed."

                        Indeed it was serious enough to deprive Grieg of one lung, leaving him

                        symbolisms of Christianity, represented by the Stranger, and with the
                        fairy-tale of the magic emerald and the voices of the ocean. This
                        complexity, which is evident enough in the poem, is even more evident in
                        the music, where a union of different arts and different ideas is
                        attempted. We get the art of the folk-song, religious art, the art of
                        Wagner, the art of Franck, as well as a note of familiar realism (which
                        is something akin to the Italian _opera-bouffe_) and descriptions of
                        sensation that are quite personal. As there are only two short acts, the
                        rapidity of the action only serves to accentuate this impression. The
                        changes are very abrupt: we are hurried from a world of human beings to
                        a world of abstract ideas, and then taken from an atmosphere of religion
                        to a land of fairies. The work is, however, clear enough from a musical
                        point of view. The more complex the elements that M. dIndy gathers
                        round him the more anxious he is to bring them into harmony. It is a
                        difficult task, and is only possible when the different elements are
                        reduced to their simplest expression and brought down to their
                        fundamental qualities--thus depriving them of the spice of their
                        individuality. M. dIndy puts different styles and ideas on the anvil,
                        and then forges them vigorously. It is natural that here and there we
                        should see the mark of the hammer, the imprint of his determination; but
                        it is only by his determination that he welded the work into a solid
                        whole.
                        The dramatic tendency of these oratorios is very marked, and it is
                        chiefly on that account that they have conquered Italy. In spite of some
                        passages which have strayed a little in the direction of opera, or even
                        melodrama, the music shows great depth of feeling. The figures of the
                        women especially are drawn with delicacy; and in the second part of
                        _Lazarus_, Marys air, \x22Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had
                        not died,\x22 recalls something of Glucks _Orfeo_ in its heart-broken
                        sadness. And again, in the same oratorio, when Jesus gives the order to
                        raise the stone from the tomb, Marthas speech, \x22Domine, jam foetet,\x22 is
                        very expressive of her sadness, fear, and shame, and human horror. I
                        should like to quote one more passage, the most moving of all, which is
                        found in the _Resurrection of Christ_, when Mary Magdalene is beside the
                        tomb of Christ; here, in her speech with the angels, in her touching
                        lamentation, and in the words of the Evangelist, \x22And when she had thus
                        said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that
                        it was Jesus,\x22 we hear a melody filled with tenderness, and seem to see
                        Christs eyes shining as they rest on Mary before she has recognised
                        Him."

                        their cult of power since Wagners death. When listening to the end of

                        her teens, though giving high promise of the great things she achieved
                        a few years later. Strange to say, a short time after its first
                        appearance, \x22Euryanthe\x22 failed to draw. One reason might have been
                        laid to the poor libretto, another to the rumor, started, it is said,
                        by no less an authority than the great master Beethoven, that the
                        music of the opera was \x22only a collection of diminished sevenths.\x22
                        From the first Claude Debussy showed himself a rare spirit, who looked
                        at the subject of musical art from a different angle than others
                        had done. For one thing he must have loved nature with whole souled
                        devotion, for he sought to reflect her moods and inspirations in his
                        compositions. Once he said: \x22I prefer to hear a few notes from an
                        Egyptian shepherds flute, for he is in accord with his scenery and
                        hears harmonies unknown to your treatises. Musicians too seldom turn
                        to the music inscribed in nature. It would benefit them more to watch
                        a sunrise than to listen to a performance of the Pastorale Symphony.
                        Go not to others for advice but take counsel of the passing breezes,
                        which relate the history of the world to those who can listen.\x22
                        As the years passed, Claude Debussy won more and more distinction as
                        a unique composer, but also gained the reputation of being a very
                        unsociable man. Physically it has been said that in his youth he
                        seemed like an Assyrian Prince; through life he retained his somewhat
                        Asiatic appearance. His eyes were slightly narrowed, his black hair
                        curled lightly over an extremely broad forehead. He spoke little
                        and often in brusque phrase. For this reason he was frequently
                        misunderstood, as the irony and sarcasm with which he sometimes spoke
                        did not tend to make friends. But this attitude was only turned toward
                        those who did not comprehend him and his ideals, or who endeavored to
                        falsify what he believed in and esteemed."

                        to sell his grand piano, so that he should be in debt to no one. This
                        was done, every one was paid off and on his arrival in Paris his old
                        friend Erard invited him to his own home till the mother came.
                        Since his desire to create a Tristan has been made impossible, let us
                        cherish the rich heritage of piano, song and orchestral works, which
                        this original French artist and thinker has left behind, to benefit
                        art and his fellow man.
                        I do not say that there may not be a decadent side in Wagner, revealing
                        super-sensitiveness or even hysteria and other modern nervous
                        affections. And if this side was lacking he would not be representative
                        of his time, and that is what every great artist ought to be. But there
                        is certainly something more in him than decadence; and if women and
                        young men cannot see anything beyond it, it only proves their inability
                        to get outside themselves. A long time ago Wagner himself complained to
                        Liszt that neither the public nor artists knew how to listen to or
                        understand any side of his music but the effeminate side: \x22They do not
                        grasp its strength,\x22 he said. \x22My supposed successes,\x22 he also tells us,
                        \x22are founded on misunderstanding. My public reputation isnt worth a
                        walnut-shell.\x22 And it is true he has been applauded, patronised, and
                        monopolised for a quarter of a century by all the decadents of art and
                        literature. Scarcely anyone has seen in him a vigorous musician and a
                        classic writer, or has recognised him as Beethovens direct successor,
                        the inheritor of his heroic and pastoral genius, of his epic
                        inspirations and battlefield rhythms, of his Napoleonic phrases and
                        atmosphere of stirring trumpet-calls."

                        was a mystic whose true domain was religious music. Nothing could
                        be wider of the mark. The public is given to generalisations, and

                        of work to the exclusion of other kinds; he was able to express

                        theater should be built, of adaptable design. But from where would the
                        funds be forthcoming? While at work on the \x22Walkere,\x22 the stories of
                        \x22Tristan\x22 and \x22Parsifal\x22 had suggested themselves, and the plan of
                        the first was already sketched. He wrote to Liszt: \x22As I have never in

                        beautiful of all my dreams.\x22 The first act of \x22Tristan and Isolde\x22
                        was finished on the last day of the year 1857. In his retreat in
                        Switzerland, the composer longed for sympathetic, intellectual
                        companionship, which, alas, Minna could not give him. He found it in
                        the society of Marie Wesendonck, wife of the kind friend and music
                        lover, who had aided him in many ways. This marked attention to
                        another aroused Minnas jealousy and an open break was imminent. The
                        storm, however, blew over for a time.
                        Above all, I fear Mahler has been sadly hypnotised by ideas about
                        power--ideas that are getting to the head of all German artists to-day.
                        He seems to have an undecided mind, and to combine sadness and irony
                        with weakness and impatience, to be a Viennese musician striving after
                        Wagnerian grandeur. No one expresses the grace of _Laendler_ and dainty
                        waltzes and mournful reveries better than he; and perhaps no one is
                        nearer the secret of Schuberts moving and voluptuous melancholy; and it
                        is Schubert he recalls at times, both in his good qualities and certain
                        of his faults. But he wants to be Beethoven or Wagner. And he is wrong;
                        for he lacks their balance and gigantic force. One saw that only too
                        well when he was conducting the _Choral Symphony_.

                        Haendel, and was able to compose at will after the manner of Rossini,
                        Verdi, Schumann, and Wagner.[116] He has written excellent music in all
                        styles--the Grecian style, and that of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and
                        eighteenth centuries. His compositions are of every kind: masses, grand

                        the orchestra, the organ, the piano, the voice, and chamber music. He is
                        the learned editor of Gluck and Rameau; and is thus not only an artist,
                        but an artist who can talk about his art. He is an unusual figure in

                        I should like to try to sketch here the strange and arresting
                        personality of the man who in Germany is considered the inheritor of
                        Wagners genius--the man who has had the audacity to write, after
                        Beethoven, an Heroic Symphony, and to imagine himself the hero.
                        He didnt want to be a bull fiddler any more than you or you or
                        you, and its greatly to his credit and indicative of his iron will,
                        consuming ambition and extraordinary musicianship that he developed,
                        according to authoritative opinion, into the best bull fiddler of his
                        time.
                        He felt at home in Vienna from the start, and very soon met the
                        leading lights of the Austrian capital. On November 16, he gave his
                        first concert, with the Helmesberger Quartet, and before a crowded
                        house. It was a real success for \x22Schumanns young prophet.\x22 Although
                        concert giving was distasteful, he appeared again on December 20, and
                        then gave a second concert on January 6, 1863, when he played Bachs
                        Chromatic Fantaisie, Beethovens Variations in C minor, his own Sonata
                        Op. 5, and Schumanns Sonata OP. 11."

  communication_note: "The death of the Queen, not long after, brought the Elector of Hanover
                        to England, to succeed her as George I. It was not likely that King
                        George would look with favor on his former Capellmeister, who had so
                        long deserted his post. But an opportunity soon came to placate his
                        Majesty. A royal entertainment, with decorated barges on the Thames
                        was arranged. An orchestra was to furnish the music, and the Lord
                        Chamberlain commissioned Handel to compose music for the fete. He
                        wrote a series of pieces, since known as \x22Water Music.\x22 The king was
                        greatly delighted with the music, had it repeated, and learning that
                        Handel conducted in person, sent for him, forgave all and granted him
                        another pension of a thousand dollars. He was also appointed teacher
                        to the daughters of the Prince of Wales, at a salary of a thousand
                        a year. With the combined sum (three thousand dollars) which he now
                        received, he felt quite independent, indeed a man of means.
                        Like the musician that Nietzsche dreamed of,[169] he seems \x22to hear
                        ringing in his ears the prelude of a deeper, stronger music, perhaps a
                        more wayward and mysterious music; a music that is super-German, which,
                        unlike other music, would not die away, nor pale, nor grow dull beside
                        the blue and wanton sea and the clear Mediterranean sky; a music
                        super-European, which would hold its own even by the dark sunsets of the
                        desert; a music whose soul is akin to the palm trees; a music that knows
                        how to live and move among great beasts of prey, beautiful and solitary;
                        a music whose supreme charm is its ignorance of good and evil. Only from
                        time to time perhaps there would flit over it the longing of the sailor
                        for home, golden shadows, and gentle weaknesses; and towards it would
                        come flying from afar the thousand tints of the setting of a moral world
                        that men no longer understood; and to these belated fugitives it would
                        extend its hospitality and sympathy.\x22 But it is always the North, the
                        melancholy of the North, and \x22all the sadness of mankind,\x22 mental
                        anguish, the thought of death, and the tyranny of life, that come and
                        weigh down afresh his spirit hungering for light, and force it into
                        feverish speculation and bitter argument. Perhaps it is better so.
                        The twenty-four Preludes were composed before the trip to Majorca,
                        though they were perfected and polished while there. Written early in
                        his career, they have a youthful vigor not often found in later
                        works. \x22Much in miniature are these Preludes of the Polish poet,\x22 says
                        Huneker.
                        Of all the characteristics of Francks fine moral nature, the most
                        remarkable was his religious faith. It must have astonished the artists
                        of his time, who were even more destitute of such a thing than they are
                        now. It made itself felt in some of his followers, especially in those
                        who were near the masters heart, as M. dIndy was. The religious
                        thought of the latter reflects in some degree the thought of his master;
                        though the shape of that thought may have undergone unconscious
                        alteration. I do not know if Franck altogether fits the conception
                        people have of him to-day. I do not want to introduce personal memories
                        of him here. I knew him well enough to love him, and to catch a glimpse
                        of the beauty and sincerity of his soul; but I did not know him well
                        enough to discover the secrets of his mind. Those who had the happiness
                        of being his intimate friends seem always to represent him as a mystic
                        who shut himself away from the spirit of his time. I hope at some future
                        date one of his friends will publish some of the conversations that he
                        had with him, of which I have heard. But this man who had so strong a
                        faith was also very independent. In his religion he had no doubts: it
                        was the mainspring of his life; though faith with him was much more a
                        matter of feeling than a matter of doctrine. But all was feeling with
                        Franck, and reason made little appeal to him. His religious faith did
                        not disturb his mind, for he did not measure men and their works by its
                        rules; and he would have been incapable of putting together a history of
                        art according to the Bible. This great Catholic had at times a very
                        pagan soul; and he could enjoy without a qualm the musical dilettantism
                        of Renan and the sonorous nihilism of Leconte de Lisle. There were no
                        limits to his vast sympathies. He did not attempt to criticise the thing
                        he loved--understanding was already in his heart. Perhaps he was right;
                        and perhaps there was more trouble in the depths of his heart than the
                        valiant serenity of its surface would lead us to believe."

  communication_note: "His mothers father lived at Meylan, a little village not far from
                        Grenoble, and there, in this picturesque valley, the family used to
                        spend a part of each summer.
                        On the evening of December 4, friends who had gathered at his bedside,
                        handed him, at his desire, the score of the Requiem, and, propped up
                        by pillows he tried to sing one of the passages. The effort was too
                        great; the manuscript slipped from his nerveless hand and he fell back
                        speechless with emotion. A few hours later, on the morning of December
                        5, 1791, this great master of whom it was prophesied that he would
                        cause all others to be forgotten, passed from the scene of his many
                        struggles and greater triumphs.
                        Toward the close of this year, 1821, his teacher Zelter announced he
                        intended going to Wiemar, to see Goethe, the aged poet of Wiemar, and
                        was willing to take Felix with him. The poets house at Wiemar was
                        indeed a shrine to the elect, and the chance of meeting the object
                        of so much hero worship, filled the impressionable mind of Felix with
                        reverential awe. Zelter on his part, felt a certain pride in bringing
                        his favorite pupil to the notice of the great man, though he would not
                        have permitted Felix to guess what he felt for anything he possessed."

  communication_note: "In the shadows of the studio that afternoon lurked John F. Royal,
                        program director of NBC. Next day he presented the Maestro with two $1
                        watches, both inscribed, \x22For Rehearsals Only.\x22 Mr. Toscanini was so
                        amused that he forgot to get angry with Mr. Royal for breaking
                        the grimly enforced rule barring all but orchestra members from
                        rehearsals.
                        I shall not say much about the four first works, where the mind and
                        manner of the artist is taking shape. The _Wanderers Sturmlied_ (the
                        song of a traveller during a storm, op. 14) is a vocal sextette with an
                        orchestral accompaniment, whose subject is taken from a poem of
                        Goethes. It was written before Strauss met Ritter, and its construction
                        is after the manner of Brahms, and shows a rather affected thought and
                        style. _Aus Italien_ (op. 16) is an exuberant picture of impressions of
                        his tour in Italy, of the ruins at Rome, the seashore at Sorrento, and
                        the life of the Italian people. _Macbeth_ (op. 23) gives us a rather
                        undistinguished series of musical interpretations of poetical subjects.
                        _Don Juan_ (op. 20) is much finer, and translates Lenaus poem into
                        music with bombastic vigour, showing us the hero who dreams of grasping
                        all the joy of the world, and how he fails, and dies after he has lost
                        faith in everything.
                        In 1847, we find Verdi in London, where on July 2, at Her Majestys
                        Theater, \x22I Masnadieri\x22 was brought out, with a cast including
                        Lablanche, Gardoni, Colletti, and above all Jenny Lind, in a part
                        composed expressly for her. All the artists distinguished themselves;
                        Jenny Lind acted admirably and sang her airs exquisitely, but the
                        opera was not a success. No two critics could agree as to its merits.
                        Verdi left England in disgust and took his music to other cities."

                        great. You could at most play me your compositions on the piano;
                        but I have no time to hear them. When you are older, and when you
                        have composed bigger works, and if by chance I return to Vienna,
                        you shall show me what you have done. But that is no use now; I
                        cannot give you an opinion of them yet.
                        One of the great organists of the time was Johann Adam Reinken. When

                        Church in Hamburg, he determined to walk the whole distance thither to
                        hear him. Now Hamburg was called in those days the \x22Paradise of German
                        music,\x22 and was twenty-five good English miles from the little town
                        of Leneburg, but what did that matter to the eager lad? Obstacles only
                        fired him to strive the harder for what he desired to attain."

                        the justice of it and at last took pride in doing their work well.

                        present, and everything passed off well, indeed remarkably well. His
                        majesty was greatly pleased and did not cough once during the whole
                        performance, as he used to do when things did not go to suit him."

  communication_note: "The father of this beloved composer was a Frenchman, born in Nancy,
                        Lorraine, in 1770, the same year Beethoven saw the light in Bonn. He
                        was carefully brought up, well-bred and well-educated. When a friend
                        of his in Warsaw, Poland, in the tobacco and snuff trade, then in high
                        repute with the nobility, needed help with his book-keeping, he sent
                        for the seventeen-year-old lad. Thus it happened that Nicholas Chopin
                        came to Warsaw in 1787. It was a time of unrest, when the nation was
                        struggling for liberty and independence. The young man applied himself
                        to master the language, and study the character and needs of his
                        adopted country, that he might be well informed. During the period of
                        insecurity in political affairs, the tobacco factory had to be closed
                        and Nicholas Chopin looked for other activity. A few years later we
                        find him in the household of Countess Skarbek, as a tutor to her son,
                        Frederic. Here he met his bride, Justina de Krzyzanowska, a young
                        lady of noble but poor family, whom he married in 1806. She became the
                        mother of his four children, three girls and a boy.
                        And this is how the work of Richard Strauss appears to me up to the
                        present. Guntram kills Duke Robert, and immediately lets fall his sword.
                        The frenzied laugh of Zarathustra ends in an avowal of discouraged
                        impotence. The delirious passion of Don Juan dies away in nothingness.
                        Don Quixote when dying forswears his illusions. Even the Hero himself
                        admits the futility of his work, and seeks oblivion in an indifferent
                        Nature. Nietzsche, speaking of the artists of our time, laughs at \x22those
                        Tantaluses of the will, rebels and enemies of laws, who come, broken in
                        spirit, and fall at the foot of the cross of Christ.\x22 Whether it is for
                        the sake of the Cross or Nothingness, these heroes renounce their
                        victories in disgust and despair, or with a resignation that is sadder
                        still. It was not thus that Beethoven overcame his sorrows. Sad adagios
                        make their lament in the middle of his symphonies, but a note of joy and
                        triumph is always sounded at the end. His work is the triumph of a
                        conquered hero; that of Strauss is the defeat of a conquering hero. This
                        irresoluteness of the will can be still more clearly seen in
                        contemporary German literature, and in particular in the author of _Die
                        versunkene Glocke_. But it is more striking in Strauss, because he is
                        more heroic. And so we get all this display of superhuman will, and the
                        end is only \x22My desire is gone!\x22
                        When he tried to get a passport for Paris, he found it impossible
                        because of his debts. Not to be turned from his purpose, he, Minna and
                        the great Newfoundland dog, his pet companion, all slipped away from
                        Riga at night and in disguise. At the port of Pillau the trio embarked
                        on a sailing vessel for Paris, the object of all his hopes. The
                        young composer carried with him one opera and half of a second
                        work--\x22Rienzi,\x22 which he had written during the years of struggle in
                        Magdeburg and Kenigsberg. In Riga he had come upon Heines version
                        of the Flying Dutchman legend, and the sea voyage served to make the
                        story more vital.
                        When the summer was over and all were back in Hamburg again, Lischen
                        used to come sometimes to Frau Brahms, of whom she soon grew very
                        fond. But it troubled her tender heart to see the poor little flat so
                        dark and dreary; for even the living room had but one small window,
                        looking into the cheerless courtyard. She felt very sorry for her
                        friends, and proposed to Hannes they should bring some scarlet runners
                        to be planted in the court. He fell in with the idea at once and it
                        was soon carried out. But alas, when the children had done their part,
                        the plants refused to grow."

                        complete, and in February he sent a copy to Liszt, who answered: \x22You

  communication_note: "After three years hard work his teacher told him he must seek another
                        master, as he could teach him nothing more. So the boy was sent to
                        Berlin, to continue his studies. Two of the prominent musicians there
                        were Ariosti and Buononcini; the former received the boy kindly and
                        gave him great encouragement; the other took a dislike to the little
                        fellow, and tried to injure him. Pretending to test his musicianship,
                        Buononcini composed a very difficult piece for the harpsichord
                        and asked him to play it at sight. This the boy did with ease and
                        correctness. The Elector was delighted with the little musician,
                        offered him a place at Court and even promised to send him to Italy
                        to pursue his studies. Both offers were refused and George returned to
                        Halle and to his old master, who was happy to have him back once more.
                        Soon more ambitious attempts at composition were made, the aim being
                        to write little operas. But unless they could be performed, it was
                        useless to try and make operas. This was a serious difficulty; but
                        Felix was deeply in earnest in whatever he undertook, and decided he
                        must have an orchestra to try out his operatic efforts. It looked like
                        an impossibility, but love and money can accomplish wonders. A small
                        orchestra was duly selected from among the members of the Court band.
                        The lad Felix was to conduct these sedate musicians, which he did
                        modestly but without embarrassment, standing on a footstool before
                        his men, waving the baton like a little general. Before the first
                        performance was quite ready, Felix felt there must be some one present
                        who could really judge of the merits of his little piece. Who would
                        do so better than his old professor of thorough bass and composition,
                        Carl Zelter, the director of the Berlin Singakademie. Zelter agreed
                        to accept this delicate office, and a large number of friends were
                        invited for the occasion.
                        \x22What makes the name of artist so splendid is that the artist is
                        free--absolutely free. Look about you, and tell me if from this
                        point of view there is any career finer than that of an artist who
                        is conscious of his mission? The Army? The Law? The University?

                        Richard Strauss is a complete contrast to Mahler. He has always the air
                        of a heedless and discontented child. Tall and slim, rather elegant and
                        supercilious, he seems to be of a more refined race than most other
                        German artists of to-day. Scornful, _blase_ with success, and very
                        exacting, his bearing towards other musicians has nothing of Mahlers
                        winning modesty. He is not less nervous than Mahler, and while he is
                        conducting the orchestra he seems to indulge in a frenzied dance which
                        follows the smallest details of his music--music that is as agitated as
                        limpid water into which a stone has been flung. But he has a great
                        advantage over Mahler; he knows how to rest after his labours. Both
                        excitable and sleepy by nature, his highly-strung nerves are
                        counterbalanced by his indolence, and there is in the depths of him a
                        Bavarian love of luxury. I am quite sure that when his hours of intense
                        living are over, after he has spent an excessive amount of energy, he
                        has hours when he is only partially alive. One then sees his eyes with a
                        vague and sleepy look in them; and he is like old Rameau, who used to
                        walk about for hours as if he were an automaton, seeing nothing and
                        thinking of nothing."

  communication_note: "I admit I cannot read this delightful criticism without laughing; and it
                        does not affect me painfully like Nietzsches pernicious and morbid
                        irony. It used to be a grief to me that two men whom I loved with an
                        equal affection, and whom I reverenced as the finest spirits in Europe,
                        remained strangers and hostile to each other. I could not bear the
                        thought that a genius, hopelessly misunderstood by the crowd, should be
                        bent on making his solitude more bitter and narrow by refusing, with a
                        sort of jealous waywardness, to be reconciled to his equals, or to offer
                        them the hand of friendship. But now I think that perhaps it was better
                        so. The first virtue of genius is sincerity. If Nietzsche had to go out
                        of his way _not_ to understand Wagner, it is natural, on the other hand,
                        that Wagner should be a closed book to Tolstoy; it would be almost
                        surprising if it were otherwise. Each one has his own part to play, and
                        has no need to change it. Wagners wonderful dreams and magic intuition
                        of the inner life are not less valuable to us than Tolstoys pitiless
                        truth, in which he exposes modern society and tears away the veil of
                        hypocrisy with which she covers herself. So I admire _Siegfried_, and
                        at the same time enjoy Tolstoys satire; for I like the latters sturdy
                        humour, which is one of the most striking features of his realism, and
                        which, as he himself noticed, makes him closely resemble Rousseau. Both
                        men show us an ultra-refined civilisation, and both are uncompromising
                        apostles of a return to nature.
                        As the years passed, Claude Debussy won more and more distinction as
                        a unique composer, but also gained the reputation of being a very
                        unsociable man. Physically it has been said that in his youth he
                        seemed like an Assyrian Prince; through life he retained his somewhat
                        Asiatic appearance. His eyes were slightly narrowed, his black hair
                        curled lightly over an extremely broad forehead. He spoke little
                        and often in brusque phrase. For this reason he was frequently
                        misunderstood, as the irony and sarcasm with which he sometimes spoke
                        did not tend to make friends. But this attitude was only turned toward
                        those who did not comprehend him and his ideals, or who endeavored to
                        falsify what he believed in and esteemed.
                        On the threshold of death he turned in despair to the one ray of light
                        left him--_Stella montis_, the inspiration of his childish love;
                        Estelle, now old, a grandmother, withered by age and grief. He made a
                        pilgrimage to Meylan, near Grenoble, to see her. He was then sixty-one
                        years old and she was nearly seventy. \x22The past! the past! O Time!
                        Nevermore! Nevermore!\x22[47]
                        From these stories there emerged a demoniacal little man with the
                        tantrums of a dozen prima donnas, a temperamental tyrant who, at
                        the dropping of a stitch in the orchestral knitting, tore his hair,
                        screamed at the top of his inexhaustible Latin lungs, doused his
                        trembling players with streams of blistering invective."

                        influence of Tolstoy and Wagner and displayed a remarkable critical
                        faculty. In 1895 (at the age of twenty-nine) we find him awarded the
                        coveted Grand Prix of the Academie Francaise for his work _Histoire de
                        lOpera en Europe avant Lulli et Scarlatti_, and in the same year he
                        sustained, before the faculty of the Sorbonne--where he now occupies the
                        chair of musical criticism--a remarkable dissertation on _The Origin
                        of_ _the Modern Lyrical Drama_--his thesis for the Doctorate. This, in
                        reality, is a vehement protest against the indifference for the Art of
                        Music which, up to that time, had always been displayed by the
                        University. In 1903 he published a remarkable _Life of Beethoven_,
                        followed by a _Life of Hugo Wolf_ in 1905. The present volume, together
                        with its companion, _Musiciens dAutrefois_, appeared in 1908. Both
                        form remarkable essays and reveal a consummate and most intimate
                        knowledge of the life and works of our great contemporaries. A just
                        estimate of a composers work is not to be arrived at without a study of
                        his works and of the conditions under which these were produced. To
                        take, for instance, the case of but one of the composers treated in this
                        volume, Hector Berlioz. No composer has been so misunderstood, so
                        vilified as he, simply because those who have written about him, either
                        wilfully or through ignorance, have grossly misrepresented him.

                        Wagner returned to Leipsic in 1834. Soon there came another impetus
                        to this budding genius: he heard for the first time the great singer
                        Wilhelmina Schroeder-Devrient, whose art made a deep impression on
                        him.
                        Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

  communication_note: "\x22You ask me the cause of my great depression of spirit, and would
                        pour balm on my wounds. Ah yes, if you only could! But no herb
                        grows that could cure my sickness; only a god could help me. If you
                        can give me back my inspirations, and wake up the familiar spirit
                        that is asleep in me, and let him possess me anew, I will call you
                        a god and raise altars to your name. My cry is to gods and not to
                        men; the gods alone are fit to pronounce my fate. But however it
                        may end, even if the worst comes, I will bear it--yes, even if no
                        ray of sunshine lightens my life again.... And with that we will,
                        once for all, turn the page and have done with this dark chapter of
                        my life.\x22
                        What was to be done? His family was ruined, for a fire had demolished
                        their little possessions. He felt the silent reproaches of his father
                        already weighing upon him--for he loved his father dearly, and
                        remembered the sacrifices he had made for him. He did not wish to return
                        to his own province; indeed he could not return--that would have been
                        death. It was necessary that this boy of seventeen should find some
                        means of earning a livelihood and be able to instruct himself at the
                        same time. After his expulsion from the Conservatoire he attended no
                        other school; he taught himself. And he taught himself wonderfully; but
                        at what a cost! The suffering he went through from that time until he
                        was thirty, the enormous amount of energy he had to expend in order to
                        live and cultivate the fine spirit of poetry that was within him--all
                        this effort and toil was, without doubt, the cause of his unhappy death.
                        He had a burning thirst for knowledge and a fever for work which made
                        him sometimes forget the necessity for eating and drinking.
                        His faith too.... I know how dangerous it is to interpret a musicians
                        feelings by his music; but how can we do otherwise when we are told by
                        Francks followers that the expression of the soul is the only end and
                        aim of music? Do we find his faith, as expressed through his music
                        always full of peace and calm?[156] I ask those who love that music
                        because they find some of their own sadness reflected there. Who has not
                        felt the secret tragedies that some of his musical passages
                        enfold--those short, characteristically abrupt phrases which seem to
                        rise in supplication to God, and often fall back in sadness and in
                        tears? It is not all light in that soul; but the light that is there
                        does not affect us less because it shines from afar,"

  communication_note: "Our composers ancestors were Irish and Scotch, though his father was
                        born in New York City and his mother was an American girl. Edward was
                        their third son, and appeared December 18, 1861; this event happened
                        at the home of his parents, 220 Clinton Street, New York.
                        And in spite of all this material misery and the sorrow of being
                        misunderstood, people speak of the glory he enjoyed. What did his
                        compeers think of him--at least, those who called themselves such? He
                        knew that Mendelssohn, whom he loved and esteemed, and who styled
                        himself his \x22good friend,\x22 despised him and did not recognise his
                        genius.[25] The large-hearted Schumann, who was, with the exception of
                        Liszt,[26] the only person who intuitively felt his greatness, admitted
                        that he used sometimes to wonder if he ought to be looked upon as \x22a
                        genius or a musical adventurer.\x22[27]
                        About the same time he invented a new way of rehearsing the
                        orchestra--the remote-control method. An assistant conductor wielded
                        the stick while Stoky sat in the rear of the dark hall manipulating an
                        intricate system of colored lights that made known his wishes to his
                        understudy on the platform.
                        About this time a distant relative, one Johann Mathias Frankh by name,
                        arrived at the Haydn cottage on a visit. He was a schoolmaster at
                        Hainburg, a little town four leagues away. During the regular evening
                        concert he took particular notice of Josef and his toy violin. The
                        childs sweet voice indicated that he had the makings of a good
                        musician. At last he said: \x22If you will let me take Sepperl, I will
                        see he is properly taught; I can see he promises well.\x22"

                        In 1853, Louis Niedermeyer founded in Paris an _Ecole de musique
                        religieuse et classique_, which strove \x22to form singers, organists,
                        choir-masters, and composers of music, by the study of the classic works
                        of the great masters of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth
                        centuries.\x22 This school, subsidised by the State, was a nursery for
                        some real musicians. It reckoned among its pupils some noted composers,
                        conductors, organists, and historians; among others, M. Gabriel Faure,
                        M. Andre Messager, M. Eugene Gigout, and M. Henry Expert. M. Saint-Saens
                        was a professor there, and became its president. Nearly five hundred

                        and other French colleges were trained there. But this school, serious

                        prevailing bad taste, did not trouble itself about influencing the

                        On June 18, 1821, came the first performance of Webers masterpiece,
                        \x22Der Freischetz.\x22 The theater was beseiged for hours by eager crowds,
                        and when the doors were at last opened, there was a grand rush to
                        enter. The whole house from pit to galleries was soon filled, and
                        when the composer entered the orchestra, there was a roar of applause,
                        which it seemed would never end. As the performance proceeded, the
                        listeners became more charmed and carried away, and at the close there
                        was a wild scene of excitement. The success had been tremendous, and
                        the frequent repetitions demanded soon filled the treasury of the
                        theater. Everybody was happy, the composer most of all. The melodies
                        were played on every piano in Germany and whistled by every street
                        urchin. Its fame spread like lightning over Europe, and quickly
                        reached England. In London the whole atmosphere seemed to vibrate with
                        its melodies. In Paris, however, it did not please on first hearing,
                        perhaps because it was so thoroughly German. But somewhat later, when
                        renamed \x22Robin des Bois,\x22--\x22Robin of the Forest,\x22--it was performed
                        some three hundred and fifty times before being withdrawn.

                        from all exaggeration\x22 and \x22Preserve the soundness of your minds
                        health.\x22[127] They are certainly not the principles of a Beethoven or a
                        Wagner, and it would be rather difficult to find a noted musician of the
                        last century who had applied them. They tell us, without need of
                        comment, what is distinctive about M. Saint-Saens, and what is defective
                        in him. He is not troubled by any sort of passion. Nothing disturbs the
                        clearness of his reason. \x22He has no prejudices; he takes no
                        side\x22[128]--one might add, not even his own, since he is not afraid to
                        change his views--\x22he does not pose as a reformer of anything\x22; he is
                        altogether independent, perhaps almost too much so. He seems sometimes
                        as if he did not know what to do with his liberty. Goethe would have
                        said, I think, that he needed a little more of the devil in him.
                        About the middle of July, 1829, Chopin with three young friends,
                        started out for Vienna. In those days an artist, in order to make
                        himself and his work known, had to travel about the world and arrange
                        concerts here and there, introduce himself to prominent people in each
                        place and make them acquainted with his gifts. The present journey had
                        for its object Vienna, the city of Beethoven and Schubert and other
                        great masters."

  communication_note: "M. Chevillard alone represented our French musicians at the festival;
                        and they could have made no better choice of a conductor. But Germany
                        had delegated her two greatest composers, Strauss and Mahler, to come to
                        conduct their newest compositions. And I think it would not have been
                        too much to set up one of our own foremost composers to combat the glory
                        which these two enjoy in their own country.
                        The fiery Koussevitzky told the Government that, unless he were
                        allowed to travel abroad, hed never play or conduct another note in
                        Russia. They let him go.
                        Not so Mr. Toscanini. In his platform manner there is nothing
                        calculated for theatrical effect. He doesnt care in the least what he
                        looks like \x22from out front.\x22 His gestures are designed not to impress,
                        enrapture or englamour the musical groundlings, but to convey his
                        sharply defined wishes to his men and transmit to them the flaming
                        enthusiasm that consumes him.
                        I have never bothered myself in art with questions of nationality. I
                        have not even concealed my preference for German music; and I consider,
                        even to-day, that Richard Strauss is the foremost musical composer in
                        Europe. Having said this, I am freer to speak of the strange impression
                        that I had at the Strasburg festival--an impression of the change that
                        is coming over music, and the way that French art is silently setting
                        about taking the place of German art."

  communication_subject: "\x22 Since then I have been several times to Bayreuth; I have seen Wagners works performed in Berlin, in Dresden, in Munich, and in other German towns, but I have never again felt the old intoxication."
  communication_note: "It had long been Wagners desire to have a theater built, in which his
                        creations could be properly given under his direction. Bayreuth had
                        been chosen, as a quiet spot where music lovers could come for the
                        sole purpose of hearing the music. He went to live there with
                        his family in April, 1872. Two years later they moved into Villa
                        Wahnfried, which had been built according to the composers ideas.
                        Meanwhile funds were being raised on both sides of the water, through
                        the Wagner Societies, to erect the Festival Theater. The corner stone
                        was laid on Wagners birthday--his fifty-ninth--May 22, 1872. It was
                        planned to give the first performances in the summer of 1876; by that
                        time Wagners longed-for project became a reality.
                        Remark also Berliozs freedom of melody. His musical phrases pulse and
                        flow like life itself. \x22Some phrases taken separately,\x22 says Schumann,
                        \x22have such an intensity that they will not bear harmonising--_as in many
                        ancient folk-songs_--and often even an accompaniment spoils their
                        fulness.\x22[89] These melodies so correspond with the emotions, that they
                        reproduce the least thrills of body and mind by their vigorous
                        workings-up and delicate reliefs, by splendid barbarities of modulation
                        and strong and glowing colour, by gentle gradations of light and shade
                        or imperceptible ripples of thought, which flow over the body like a
                        steady tide. It is an art of peculiar sensitiveness, more delicately
                        expressive than that of Wagner; not satisfying itself with the modern
                        tonality, but going back to old modes--a rebel, as M. Saint-Saens
                        remarks, to the polyphony which had governed music since Bachs day, and
                        which is perhaps, after all, \x22a heresy destined to disappear.\x22[90]"

  communication_note: "So Wagner was impelled by the inner flame of creative fire, to work

                        the \x22Music of the Future.\x22
                        This is how Wagner wrote to Liszt when he was finishing this amazing
                        work of art. In the same way Michelangelo wrote to his father in 1509:
                        \x22I am in agony. I have not dared to ask the Pope for anything, because
                        my work does not make sufficient progress to merit any remuneration. The
                        work is too difficult, and indeed it is not my profession. I am wasting

                        overlooking the deep blue lakes,--or listened as they sang at their
                        work in the sunny fields. He gazed at the wonderful processions of
                        priests through narrow streets of the towns, but above all there was
                        the grand music in the cathedrals."

  communication_note: "To go back a bit in our composers life story, to an affair of
                        the heart which he experienced in 1868. He became engaged to the
                        well-known singer Desiree Artet; the affair never went further, for
                        what reason is not known. He was not yet thirty, impressionable and
                        intense. Later on, in the year 1877, at the age of thirty-seven, he
                        became a married man. How this happened was doubtless told in his
                        diaries, which were written with great regularity: but unfortunately
                        he destroyed them all a few years before his death. The few facts that
                        have been gleaned from his intimate friend, M. Kashkin, are that he
                        was engaged to the lady in the spring of this year, and married her
                        a month or so afterward. It was evidently a hasty affair and
                        subsequently brought untold suffering to the composer. When
                        the professors of his Conservatoire re-assembled in the autumn,
                        Tschaikowsky appeared among them a married man, but looking the
                        picture of despair. A few weeks later he fled from Moscow, and when
                        next heard of was lying dangerously ill in St. Petersburg. One thing
                        was evident, the ill-considered marriage came very near ruining his
                        life. The doctors ordered rest and change of scene, and his brother
                        Modeste Ilyitch took him to Switzerland and afterward to Italy. The
                        peaceful life and change of scene did much to restore his shattered
                        nerves. Just at this time a wealthy widow lady, Madame von Meek, a
                        great admirer of Tschaikowskys music, learning of his sad condition,
                        settled on him a generous yearly allowance for life. He was now
                        independent and could give his time to composition."

                        wheedles the tone from the men. It coaxes, hushes, demands increased
                        volume. It moves, trembling, to the heart to ask for feeling, closes
                        into a fist to get sound and fury from the brasses, thunder from the
                        drums. Through it all, the Maestro talks, sings, whistles and blows
                        out his cheeks for the benefit of trumpeters and trombonists.
                        Then contrast Berlioz with Wagner. Wagner, too, was stirred by violent
                        passions, but he was always master of himself, and his reason remained
                        unshaken by the storms of his heart or those of the world, by the
                        torments of love or the strife of political revolutions. He made his
                        experiences and even his errors serve his art; he wrote about his
                        theories before he put them into practice; and he only launched out when
                        he was sure of himself, and when the way lay clear before him. And think
                        how much Wagner owes to this written expression of his aims and the
                        magnetic attraction of his arguments. It was his prose works that
                        fascinated the King of Bavaria before he had heard his music; and for
                        many others also they have been the key to that music. I remember being
                        impressed by Wagners ideas when I only half understood his art; and
                        when one of his compositions puzzled me, my confidence was not shaken,
                        for I was sure that the genius who was so convincing in his reasoning
                        would not blunder; and that if his music baffled me, it was I who was at
                        fault. Wagner was really his own best friend, his own most trusty
                        champion; and his was the guiding hand that led one through the thick
                        forest and over the rugged crags of his work."

  communication_note: "About this time a distant relative, one Johann Mathias Frankh by name,
                        arrived at the Haydn cottage on a visit. He was a schoolmaster at
                        Hainburg, a little town four leagues away. During the regular evening
                        concert he took particular notice of Josef and his toy violin. The
                        childs sweet voice indicated that he had the makings of a good
                        musician. At last he said: \x22If you will let me take Sepperl, I will
                        see he is properly taught; I can see he promises well.\x22
                        From the first Claude Debussy showed himself a rare spirit, who looked
                        at the subject of musical art from a different angle than others
                        had done. For one thing he must have loved nature with whole souled
                        devotion, for he sought to reflect her moods and inspirations in his
                        compositions. Once he said: \x22I prefer to hear a few notes from an
                        Egyptian shepherds flute, for he is in accord with his scenery and
                        hears harmonies unknown to your treatises. Musicians too seldom turn
                        to the music inscribed in nature. It would benefit them more to watch
                        a sunrise than to listen to a performance of the Pastorale Symphony.
                        Go not to others for advice but take counsel of the passing breezes,
                        which relate the history of the world to those who can listen.\x22"

  communication_note: "With the home atmosphere he enjoyed, the boy Grieg early became
                        familiar with names of the great composers and their works. One of
                        his idols was Chopin, whose strangely beautiful harmonies were just
                        beginning to be heard, though not yet appreciated. His music must have
                        had an influence over the lads own efforts, for he always remained
                        true to this ideal.
                        With a view of aiding the growth of the opera, and operatic art, the
                        Elector founded a national theater, and Beethoven was appointed viola
                        player in the orchestra besides still being assistant organist in the
                        chapel. In July, 1792, the band arranged a reception for Haydn, who
                        was to pass through Bonn on his way from London, where he had had
                        a wonderful success, to his home in Vienna. Beethoven seized the
                        opportunity to show the master a cantata he had just composed. Haydn
                        praised the work and greatly encouraged the young musician to go
                        forward in his studies. The Elector, hearing of Haydns words of
                        praise, felt that Beethoven should have the chance to develop his
                        talents that he might be able to produce greater works. Therefore
                        he decided to send the young composer, at his own expense, to
                        study strict counterpoint with Haydn. He was now twenty-two and his
                        compositions already published had brought him considerable fame and
                        appreciation in his vicinity. Now he was to have wider scope for his
                        gifts.
                        The first ideas of _Siegfried_ were contemporary with the Revolution of
                        1848, which Wagner took part in with the same enthusiasm he put into
                        everything else. His recognised biographer, Herr Houston Stewart
                        Chamberlain--who, with M. Henri Lichtenberger, has succeeded best in
                        unravelling Wagners complex soul, though he is not without certain
                        prejudices--has been at great pains to prove that Wagner was always a
                        patriot and a German monarchist. Well, he may have been so later on, but
                        it was not, I think, the last phase of his evolution. His actions speak
                        for themselves. On 14 June, 1848, in a famous speech to the National
                        Democratic Association, Wagner violently attacked the organisation of
                        society itself, and demanded both the abolition of money and the
                        extinction of what was left of the aristocracy. In _Das Kunstwerk der
                        Zukunft_ (1849) he showed that beyond the \x22local nationalism\x22 were signs
                        of a \x22supernational universalism.\x22 And all this was not merely talk, for
                        he risked his life for his ideas. Herr Chamberlain himself quotes the
                        account of a witness who saw him, in May, 1849, distributing
                        revolutionary pamphlets to the troops who were besieging Dresden. It was
                        a miracle that he was not arrested and shot. We know that after Dresden
                        was taken a warrant was out against him, and he fled to Switzerland,
                        with a passport on which was a borrowed name. If it be true that Wagner
                        later declared that he had been \x22involved in error and led away by his
                        feelings\x22 it matters little to the history of that time. Errors and
                        enthusiasms are an integral part of life, and one must not ignore them
                        in a mans biography under the pretext that he regretted them twenty or
                        thirty years later, for they have, nevertheless, helped to guide his
                        actions and impressed his imagination. It was out of the Revolution
                        itself that _Siegfried_ directly sprang."

                        composer of it. He was passionately enamored of it; he told the Queen
                        the air of France had rejuvenated his creative powers, and the sight
                        of her majesty had given such a wonderful impetus to the flow
                        of ideas, that his composition had become like herself, angelic,

                        The zenith of Berliozs genius was reached, when he was thirty-five
                        years old, with the _Requiem_ and _Romeo_. They are his two most
                        important works, and are two works about which one may feel very
                        differently. For my part, I am very fond of the one, and I dislike the
                        other; but both of them open up two great new roads in art, and both are
                        placed like two gigantic arches on the triumphal way of the revolution
                        that Berlioz started. I will return to the subject of these works later.
                        In the spring of 1887, MacDowell, in one of his walks about the town,
                        discovered a deserted cottage on the edge of the woods. It overlooked
                        the town, with the Rhine beyond, and woods on the other side of the
                        river. Templeton Strong, an American composer, was with him at the
                        time, and both thought the little cottage an ideal spot for a home.
                        It was soon purchased, and the young husband and wife lived an idyllic
                        life for the next year. A small garden gave them exercise out of
                        doors, the woods were always enticing and best of all, MacDowell was
                        able to give his entire time to composition. Many beautiful songs
                        and piano pieces were the result, besides the symphonic poem \x22Lamia,\x22
                        \x22Hamlet and Ophelia,\x22 the \x22Lovely Aida,\x22 \x22Lancelot and Elaine,\x22 and
                        other orchestral works.

                        The father was a contra bass player in the theater; he often had to
                        play in dance halls and beer gardens, indeed where he could. Later he
                        became a member of the band that gave nightly concerts at the Alster

                        Peter Ilyitch was less than five years old when a new governess came
                        into the family, to teach his elder brother Nicholas and his cousin
                        Lydia. As a little boy he was apt to be untidy, with buttons missing
                        and rumpled hair. But his nature was so affectionate and sympathetic
                        that he charmed every one with his pretty, loving ways. This natural
                        gift he always retained. The governess was a very superior person and
                        her influence over her young charges was healthful and beneficial. The
                        child Peter was most industrious at his lessons; but for recreation
                        often preferred playing the piano, reading, or writing poetry, to
                        playing with other children.

                        the Wagner of other days, it is perhaps because I do not recognise my
                        former self. A work of art, and above all a work of musical art, changes
                        with ourselves. _Siegfried_, for example, is for me no longer full of
                        mystery. The qualities in it that strike me to-day are its cheerful
                        vigour, its clearness of form, its virile force and freedom, and the
                        extraordinary healthiness of the hero, and, indeed, of the whole work.

                        sharper than the first. Oppressive, electrical silence. He lifts the
                        baton as if saluting the orchestra. The concert begins.
                        As far as one can judge, M. Saint-Saens musical ideas are infused with
                        the spirit of the great classics belonging to the end of the eighteenth
                        century--far more, whatever people may say, with the spirit of
                        Beethoven, Haydn, and Mozart, than with the spirit of Bach. Schumanns
                        seductiveness also left its mark upon him, and he has felt the influence
                        of Gounod, Bizet, and Wagner. But a stronger influence was that of
                        Berlioz, his friend and master,[130] and, above all, that of Liszt. We
                        must stop at this last name."

                        is. One has little inclination to smile when one sees the depths of that
                        desolate heart. Do you think he did not see, as clearly as you or I
                        would see, the wrinkled old face, the indifference of age, the \x22_triste
                        raison_,\x22 in her he idealised? Remember, he was the most ironical of
                        men. But he did not wish to see these things, he wished to cling to a
                        little love, which would help him to live in the wilderness of life.
                        That page makes one shudder. Suicide is less distressing. Neither
                        Beethoven nor Wagner suffered such tortures. What would Wagner have done
                        on a like occasion? He would have written the symphony without
                        doubt--and he would have been right. But poor Berlioz, who was weak
                        enough to sacrifice his duty to love, was, alas! also heroic enough to
                        sacrifice his genius to duty.[24]

  communication_subject: "The story of Chopins attraction for Marie Wodzinski and his reported engagement to her, is soon told."
  communication_note: "We have sketched the childhood and youth of this wonderful artist up
                        to this point. We will pass lightly over this decade of his career,
                        merely stating briefly that the lady--the beautiful Countess dAgoult,
                        captivated by the brilliant talents of the Hungarian virtuoso, left
                        her husband and child, and became for ten years the faithful companion
                        of his travels and tours over Europe. Many writers agree that Liszt
                        endeavored to dissuade her from this attraction, and behaved as
                        honorably as he could under the circumstances. A part of the time
                        they lived in Switzerland, and it was there that many of Liszts
                        compositions were written.
                        Thus, by the end of September, 1838, Schumann started for Vienna with
                        many high hopes. A friend invited him to remain at his house, which
                        was of much advantage. He made many calls and visits, saw musicians
                        and publishers, and really learned to know the city for itself. He
                        found it would not be profitable for him to publish the Journal there,
                        also that the Austrian capital was a no more propitious place to make
                        ones fortune than the smaller town of Leipsic. However he was able to
                        compose a number of works which have become among the best known and
                        beloved of all, including the \x22Arabesque,\x22 \x22Faschingsschwank,\x22 or
                        \x22Carnival Strains from Vienna,\x22 the \x22Night Pieces,\x22 Op. 24, and other
                        short compositions.
                        The _Societe des Concerts du Conservatoire_, founded in 1828 under the
                        direction of Habeneck, has had its hour of glory in the musical history
                        of Paris. It was through this society that Beethovens greatness was
                        revealed to France.[212] It was at the Conservatoire that the early
                        important works of Berlioz were first given: _La Fantastique_, _Harold_,
                        and _Romeo et Juliette_. It was there, nearer our own time, that
                        Saint-Saenss _Symphonie avec Orgue_ and Cesar Francks _Symphonie_ were
                        played for the first time. But for a long time the Conservatoire seemed
                        to take its name too literally, and to restrict its sphere to that of a
                        museum for classical music."

  communication_note: "From the very beginning, his playing on the new organ excited
                        admiration, but his artistic temperament frequently threatened to
                        be his undoing. For the young enthusiast was no sooner seated at the
                        organ to conduct the church music than he forgot that the choir and
                        congregation were depending on him and would begin to improvise at
                        such length that the singing had to stop altogether, while the people
                        listened in mute admiration. Of course there were many disputes
                        between the new organist and the elders of the church, but they
                        overlooked his vagaries because of his genius.
                        These hurricanes are let loose in order to speak to the people, to stir
                        and rouse the dull ocean of humanity. The _Requiem_ is a Last Judgment,
                        not meant, like that of the Sixtine Chapel (which Berlioz did not care
                        for at all) for great aristocracies, but for a crowd, a surging,
                        excited, and rather savage crowd. The _Marche de Rakoczy_ is less an
                        Hungarian march than the music for a revolutionary fight; it sounds the
                        charge; and Berlioz tells us it might bear Virgils verses for a
                        motto:--
                        The first lectures on Aesthetics and Musical History were not given in
                        France until after the war of 1870.[238] They were then given at the
                        Conservatoire, and, until quite lately, were the only lectures on Music
                        of any importance in Paris. Since 1878 they have been given in a very
                        excellent way by M. Bourgault-Ducoudray; but, as is only natural in a
                        school of music, their character is artistic rather than scientific, and
                        takes the form of a sort of illustration of the practical work that is
                        done at the Conservatoire. And as for Parisian musical criticism as a
                        whole, it had, thirty years ago, an almost exclusively literary
                        character, and was without technical precision or historical knowledge.
                        But the story does not stop there; for we leave symbolic abstractions to
                        enter a still more extraordinary domain, which is removed even farther
                        still from realities."

  communication_note: "[Footnote 3: The literary work of Berlioz is rather uneven. Beside
                        passages of exquisite beauty we find others that are ridiculous in their
                        exaggerated sentiment, and there are some that even lack good taste. But
                        he had a natural gift of style, and his writing is vigorous, and full of
                        feeling, especially towards the latter half of his life. The _Procession
                        des Rogations_ is often quoted from the _Memoires_; and some of his
                        poetical text, particularly that in _LEnfance du Christ_ and in _Les
                        Troyens_, is written in beautiful language and with a fine sense of
                        rhythm. His _Memoires_ as a whole is one of the most delightful books
                        ever written by an artist. Wagner was a greater poet, but as a prose
                        writer Berlioz is infinitely superior. See Paul Morillots essay on
                        _Berlioz ecrivain_, 1903, Grenoble.] One would think that such an
                        imaginative and skilful writer, accustomed in his profession of critic
                        to express every shade of feeling, would be able to tell us more exactly
                        his ideas of art than a Beethoven or a Mozart. But it is not so. As too
                        much light may blind the vision, so too much intellect may hinder the
                        understanding. Berliozs mind spent itself in details; it reflected
                        light from too many facets, and did not focus itself in one strong beam
                        which would have made known his power. He did not know how to dominate
                        either his life or his work; he did not even try to dominate them. He
                        was the incarnation of romantic genius, an unrestrained force,
                        unconscious of the road he trod. I would not go so far as to say that he
                        did not understand himself, but there are certainly times when he is
                        past understanding himself. He allows himself to drift where chance will
                        take him,[4] like an old Scandinavian pirate laid at the bottom of his
                        boat, staring up at the sky; and he dreams and groans and laughs and
                        gives himself up to his feverish delusions. He lived with his emotions
                        as uncertainly as he lived with his art. In his music, as in his
                        criticisms of music, he often contradicts himself, hesitates, and turns
                        back; he is not sure either of his feelings or his thoughts. He has
                        poetry in his soul, and strives to write operas; but his admiration
                        wavers between Gluck and Meyerbeer. He has a popular genius, but
                        despises the people. He is a daring musical revolutionary, but he
                        allows the control of this musical movement to be taken from him by
                        anyone who wishes to have it. Worse than that: he disowns the movement,
                        turns his back upon the future, and throws himself again into the past.
                        For what reason? Very often he does not know. Passion, bitterness,
                        caprice, wounded pride--these have more influence with him than the
                        serious things of life. He is a man at war with himself.
                        Hannes began to be known as a musician among the best families of
                        Winsen, and often played in their homes. He also had the chance to
                        conduct a small chorus of womens voices, called the Choral Society of
                        Winsen. He was expected to turn his theoretical studies to account by
                        composing something for this choir. It was for them he produced his
                        \x22A B C\x22 song for four parts, using the letters of the alphabet. The
                        composition ended with the words \x22Winsen, eighteen-hundred seven and
                        forty,\x22 sung slowly and fortissimo. The little piece was tuneful and
                        was a great favorite with the teachers, from that day to this."

                        chamber-music. But its atmosphere is becoming daily more rarefied. That
                        is a danger. It is to be feared that this art and thought may be
                        absorbed by the decadent subtleties or pedantic scholasticism which is
                        apt to accompany all coteries--in short, that its music will be

                        have felt this at times; and at different periods has sought contact
                        with the general public, and put itself into direct communication with
                        it. \x22It becomes more and more necessary,\x22 wrote M. Saint-Saens, \x22that

                        hearing of their music and a performance of it before the general
                        public--something which would not be a speculative thing like a big
                        concert, but which would be analogous to the artistic attraction of an
                        exhibition of painting, and which would dare everything. It is a new aim
                        for the _Societe Nationale_.\x22 But it does not seem that it has yet
                        attained this goal, nor that it is near attaining it, despite some not
                        quite happy attempts."

                        of youthful illusions, as in _Guntram_. Then it becomes vexed and

                        encounters. Its scorn increases, and becomes sarcastic _(Till
                        Eulenspiegel)_; it is exasperated with years of conflict, and, in
                        increasing bitterness, develops into a contemptuous heroism. How
                        Strausss laugh whips and stings us in _Zarathustra_! How his will
                        bruises and cuts us in _Heldenleben_! Now that he has proved his power
                        by victory, his pride knows no limit; he is elated and is unable to see
                        that his lofty visions have become realities. But the people whose
                        spirit he reflects see it. There are germs of morbidity in Germany
                        to-day, a frenzy of pride, a belief in self, and a scorn for others that
                        recalls France in the seventeenth century. \x22_Dem Deutschen gehoert die
                        Welt_\x22 (\x22Germany possesses the world\x22) calmly say the prints displayed
                        in the shop windows in Berlin. But when one arrives at this point the
                        mind becomes delirious. All genius is raving mad if it comes to that;
                        but Beethovens madness concentrated itself in himself, and imagined
                        things for his own enjoyment. The genius of many contemporary German
                        artists is an aggressive thing, and is characterised by its destructive
                        antagonism. The idealist who \x22possesses the world\x22 is liable to
                        dizziness. He was made to rule over an interior world. The splendour of
                        the exterior images that he is called upon to govern dazzles him; and,
                        like Caesar, he goes astray. Germany had hardly attained the position of
                        empire of the world when she found Nietzsches voice and that of the
                        deluded artists of the _Deutsches Theater_ and the _Secession_. Now
                        there is the grandiose music of Richard Strauss.
                        Little Sebastian suffered in silence from this coldness. Fortunately
                        the force of his genius was too great to be crushed. He knew all the
                        simple pieces by heart, which his brother set for his lessons, and
                        he longed for bigger things. There was a book of manuscript music
                        containing pieces by Buxtehude and Frohberger, famous masters of the
                        time, in the possession of Christoph. Sebastian greatly desired to
                        play the pieces in that book, but his brother kept it under lock and
                        key in his cupboard, or bookcase. One day the child mustered courage
                        to ask permission to take the book for a little while. Instead of
                        yielding to the boys request Christoph became angry, told him not to
                        imagine he could study such masters as Buxtehude and Frohberger, but
                        should be content to get the lessons assigned him."

                        1848--which should have had his sympathies. Instead of finding material,
                        like Wagner, in the excitement of that time for impassioned
                        compositions, he worked at _LEnfance du Christ_. He affected absolute
                        indifference--he who was so little made for indifference. He approved
                        the States action, and despised its visionary hopes.] What
                        ingratitude! He owed to these revolutions, to these democratic storms,
                        to these human tempests, the best of all his genius--and he disowned it
                        all. This musician of a new era took refuge in the past.
                        Bach always preferred a life of quiet and retirement; simplicity had
                        ever been his chief characteristic. He was always very religious; his
                        greatest works voice the noblest sentiments of exaltation.
                        \x22Genevieve\x22 was given in Leipsic in June 1850, directed by the
                        composer. Two more performances were given and then the work was laid
                        away.
                        I have quoted this rather long passage to show how the impression made
                        by one of Rameaus operas on his contemporaries resembled that made by
                        Wagner on his enemies. It was not without reason that Rameau was said to
                        be Wagners forerunner, as Rousseau was Tolstoys forerunner."

                        of a comic opera which he called \x22The Devil on two Sticks,\x22 and was
                        looking for some one to compose the music. In one place there was to
                        be a tempest at sea, and Haydn was asked how he would represent that.
                        As he had never seen the sea, he was at a loss how to express it. The
                        manager said he himself had never seen the ocean, but to his mind it
                        was like this, and he began to toss his arms wildly about. Haydn tried
                        every way he could think of to represent the ocean, but Kurz was not
                        satisfied. At last he flung his hands down with a crash on each end
                        of the keyboard and brought them together in the middle. \x22Thats it,
                        thats it,\x22 cried the manager and embraced the youth excitedly. All
                        went well with the rest of the opera. It was finished and produced,
                        but did not make much stir, a fact which was not displeasing to the
                        composer, as he was not proud of his first attempt."

  communication_note: "After three years hard work his teacher told him he must seek another
                        master, as he could teach him nothing more. So the boy was sent to
                        Berlin, to continue his studies. Two of the prominent musicians there
                        were Ariosti and Buononcini; the former received the boy kindly and
                        gave him great encouragement; the other took a dislike to the little
                        fellow, and tried to injure him. Pretending to test his musicianship,
                        Buononcini composed a very difficult piece for the harpsichord
                        and asked him to play it at sight. This the boy did with ease and
                        correctness. The Elector was delighted with the little musician,
                        offered him a place at Court and even promised to send him to Italy
                        to pursue his studies. Both offers were refused and George returned to

                        The young musician was profoundly moved; the father too was much
                        affected by the solemn service. Neither spoke as they left the chapel
                        and sought their lodgings. After they had retired the boy could not
                        sleep; his thoughts were filled with the wonderful music he had heard.
                        He arose, lit the lamp, and got out pens and music paper. He worked
                        industriously the long night through. When morning dawned the boy sat

                        advisable to open at once. He turned over the leaves, reading through
                        the Sonata. He had now become interested, but my courage dropped to
                        zero when he asked me to play the Sonata, but there was no help for
                        it."

  communication_note: "Frau Schumann returned to Desseldorf the next day, accompanied by
                        Brahms and Joachim. Together they set in order the papers left by the
                        composer, and assisted the widow in many little ways. A little later
                        she went to Switzerland to recover her strength, accompanied by
                        Brahms and his sister Elise. A number of weeks were spent in rest and
                        recuperation. By October the three musicians were ready to take up
                        their ordinary routine again. Frau Clara began practising for her
                        concert season, Joachim returned to his post in Hanover, and Johann
                        turned his face toward Hamburg, giving some concerts on the way, in
                        which he achieved pronounced success.
                        Talking the matter over with musicians and friends, he began to
                        interest them in the plan to study the music of the Passion. Soon
                        he had secured sixteen good voices, who rehearsed at his home once
                        a week. His enthusiasm fired them to study the music seriously, and
                        before very long they were anxious to give a public performance.
                        There was a splendid choir of nearly four hundred voices conducted by
                        Zelter, at the Singakademie; if he would only lend his chorus to give
                        a trial performance, under Mendelssohns conducting, how splendid that
                        would be! But Felix knew that Zelter had no faith in the public taking
                        any interest in Bach, so there was no use asking. This opinion was
                        opposed by one of his little choir, named Devrient, who insisted that
                        Zelter should be approached on the subject. As he himself had been
                        a pupil of Zelter, he persuaded Mendelssohn to accompany him to the
                        directors house."

  communication_note: "The Kings birthday was to be celebrated on June 4 and London was
                        crowded with people from all parts of the country. Leopold Mozart had
                        chosen June 5 as the date for his first public concert. The hall was
                        filled to overflowing; one hundred guineas being taken in. Many of the
                        assisting performers would take no fee for their services, which added
                        to the fathers gratitude and happiness.
                        From the first Claude Debussy showed himself a rare spirit, who looked
                        at the subject of musical art from a different angle than others
                        had done. For one thing he must have loved nature with whole souled
                        devotion, for he sought to reflect her moods and inspirations in his
                        compositions. Once he said: \x22I prefer to hear a few notes from an
                        Egyptian shepherds flute, for he is in accord with his scenery and
                        hears harmonies unknown to your treatises. Musicians too seldom turn
                        to the music inscribed in nature. It would benefit them more to watch
                        a sunrise than to listen to a performance of the Pastorale Symphony.
                        Go not to others for advice but take counsel of the passing breezes,
                        which relate the history of the world to those who can listen.\x22
                        This movement with regard to musical study grew rapidly; and the first
                        International Congress of Music, held in Paris at the time of the
                        Universal Exhibition of 1900, gave historians of music an opportunity of
                        realising their influence. In a few years, teaching about music was to
                        be had everywhere. At first there were the free lectures of M. Lionel
                        Dauriac and M. Georges Houdard at the Sorbonne, those of MM. Aubry,
                        Gastoue, Pirro, and Vincent dIndy at the _Schola_ and the _Institut
                        Catholique_; and then, at the beginning of 1902, there was the little
                        Faculty of Music of the _Ecole des Hautes Etudes sociales_, making a
                        centre for the efforts of French scholars of music; and, in 1900, two
                        official courses of lectures on Musical History and Aesthetics were
                        given at the College de France and the Sorbonne.
                        Haydn was blissfully happy over the realization of his highest hopes.
                        In his wildest dreams he had never imagined such magnificence as he
                        found at the palace of Eisenstadt. The great buildings, troops of
                        servants, the wonderful parks and gardens, with their flowers, lakes
                        and fountains almost made him believe he was in fairyland. Of course
                        there would be some hard work, though it would not seem hard amid such
                        fascinating surroundings and there would be plenty of leisure for his
                        own creative activities. Best of all his wife could not be with him."

                        position and the confidence of Neefe spurred Ludwig on to a passion of
                        work which nothing could check. He began to compose; three sonatas
                        for the pianoforte were written about this time. Before completing his
                        thirteenth year, Ludwig obtained his first official appointment from
                        the Elector; he became what is called cembalist in the orchestra,
                        which meant that he had to play the piano in the orchestra, and
                        conduct the band at rehearsals. With this appointment there was no
                        salary attached either, and it was not until a year later when he was
                        made second organist to the Court, under the new Elector, Max Franz,
                        that he began to receive a small salary, equal to about sixty-five
                        dollars a year. We have seen that the straits of the family had not
                        prevented Ludwig from pursuing his musical studies with great ardor.
                        With his present attainments and his ambition for higher achievements,
                        he longed to leave the little town of Bonn, and see something of the
                        great world. Vienna was the center of the musical life of Germany; the
                        boy dreamed of this magical city by day as he went about his routine
                        of work, and by night as he lay on his poor narrow cot. Like Haydn,
                        Vienna was the goal of his ambition. When a kind friend, knowing his
                        great longing, came forward with an offer to pay the expenses of the
                        journey, the lad knew his dream was to become a reality. In Vienna he
                        would see the first composers of the day; best of all he would see and
                        meet the divine Mozart, the greatest of them all."

                        11, 1830. Chopin requested Constantia Gladowska, whom he had never
                        met, to sing an aria. In the success of the evening sorrow was
                        forgotten. He wrote to his friend: \x22Miss Gladowska wore a white gown

                        she or Juliet whom he loved?). He caught but a glance of her, and it was
                        all over with him. He cried out, \x22Ah, I am lost!\x22 He desired her; she
                        repulsed him. He lived in a delirium of suffering and passion; he
                        wandered about for days and nights like a madman, up and down Paris and
                        its neighbourhood, without purpose or rest or relief, until sleep
                        overcame him wherever it found him--among the sheaves in a field near
                        Villejuif, in a meadow near Sceaux, on the bank of the frozen Seine near
                        Neuilly, in the snow, and once on a table in the Cafe Cardinal, where he
                        slept for five hours, to the great alarm of the waiters, who thought he
                        was dead.[17] Meanwhile, he was told slanderous gossip about Henrietta,
                        which he readily believed. Then he despised her, and dishonoured her
                        publicly in his _Symphonie fantastique_, paying homage in his bitter
                        resentment to Camille Moke, a pianist, to whom he lost his heart without

                        And now sudden sorrow swept over the little family. At the beginning
                        of April one of the little boys fell ill. Before the doctors could
                        understand what was the matter, the little fellow breathed his last
                        in the arms of his desperate mother. A few days after this, the other
                        child sickened and died. In June the young wife, unable to bear the
                        strain, passed away and Verdi saw the third coffin leave his door
                        carrying the last of his dear ones. And in the midst of these crushing
                        trials he was expected to compose a comic opera! But he bravely
                        completed his task. \x22Un Giorno di Regno\x22 naturally proved a dead
                        failure. In the despondency that followed, the composer resolved to
                        give up composition altogether. Merelli scolded him roundly for such
                        a decision, and promised if, some day, he chose to take up his pen
                        again, he would, if given two months notice, produce any opera Verdi
                        might write.

                        Up to the age of fifteen, Frederic was taught at home, in his fathers
                        school. He now entered the Warsaw Lyceum, and proved a good student,
                        twice carrying off a prize. With this studiousness was joined a gaiety
                        and sprightliness that manifested itself in all sorts of fun and
                        mischief. He loved to play pranks on his sisters, comrades and others,
                        and had a fondness for caricature, taking off the peculiarities of
                        those about him with pose and pen. Indeed it was the opinion of a
                        clever member of the profession, that the lad was born to become a
                        great actor. All the young Chopins had a great fondness for literature
                        and writing; they occasionally tried their hand at poetry, and the
                        production of original one-act plays, written for birthday fetes and
                        family parties."

  communication_subject: "The death of Manzoni soon after this caused the composer to carry out the idea."
  communication_note: "The action takes place in the thirteenth century, in Germany. The first
                        act gives us a glade near a little lake. The country people are in
                        revolt against the nobles, and have just been repulsed. Guntram and his
                        master Friedhold distribute alms among them, and the band of defeated
                        men then take flight into the woods. Left alone, Guntram begins to muse
                        on the delights of springtime and the innocent awakening of Nature. But
                        the thought of the misery that its beauty hides weighs upon him. He
                        thinks of mens evil doing, of human suffering, and of civil war. He
                        gives thanks to Christ for having led him to this unhappy country,
                        kisses the cross, and decides to go to the court of the tyrant who is
                        the cause of all the trouble, and make known to him the Divine
                        revelation. At that moment Freihild appears. She is the wife of Duke
                        Robert, who is the cruellest of all the nobles, and she is horrified by
                        all that is happening around her; life seems hateful to her, and she
                        wishes to drown herself. But Guntram prevents her; and the pity that her
                        beauty and trouble had at first aroused changes unconsciously into love
                        when he recognises her as the beloved princess and sole benefactress of
                        the unhappy people. He tells her that God has sent him to her for her
                        salvation. Then he goes to the castle, where he believes himself to be
                        sent on the double mission of saving the people--and Freihild.
                        The general public were not really interested in the art of the old
                        musicians until the _Association des Chanteurs de Saint-Gervais_ was
                        founded in 1892 by Charles Bordes, the choirmaster of the church of
                        Saint-Gervais. The immediate success and the noisy renown of the Society
                        were due to other things besides the talent of its conductor, who
                        combined with a lively artistic intelligence both common-sense and
                        energy and a remarkable gift for organisation--it was due partly to the
                        help of favourable circumstances, partly to the surfeit of Wagnerism, of
                        which I have just spoken, and partly to the birth of a new religious
                        art, which had sprung up since the death of Cesar Franck round the
                        memory of that great musician.
                        And, lastly, I want to speak of the greatest danger of all that menaces
                        music in Germany; _there is too much music in Germany_. This is not a
                        paradox. There is no worse misfortune for art than a super-abundance of
                        it. The music is drowning the musicians. Festival succeeds festival: the
                        day after the Strasburg festival there was to be a Bach festival at
                        Eisenach; and then, at the end of the week, a Beethoven festival at
                        Bonn. Such a plethora of concerts, theatres, choral societies, and
                        chamber-music societies, absorbs the whole life of the musician. When
                        has he time to be alone to listen to the music that sings within him?
                        This senseless flood of music invades the sanctuaries of his soul,
                        weakens its power, and destroys its sacred solitude and the treasures of
                        its thought.
                        The early December dusk was closing in over the quaint old city of
                        Salzburg. Up on the heights above the town the battlements of the
                        great castle caught a reflection of the last gleams of light in the
                        sky. But the narrow streets below were quite in shadow."

                        \x22to listen to one of Beethovens symphonies as a penance likely to give
                        him the most excruciating torture.\x22[111] And yet after this, and after

                        It was a happy household that retired that night. Nannerl was happy
                        because she at last had the chance to take piano lessons. Wolfgang,
                        little \x22Starbeam,\x22 dreamed of the wonderful Goddess of Music, who
                        carried him away to fairyland which was filled with beautiful music.

  communication_note: "There was an institution in Busseto called the Monte di Piete, which
                        gave four scholarships of three hundred francs a year, each given for
                        four years to promising young men needing money to study science or
                        art. Through Barezzi one of these scholarships was given to Verdi, it
                        being arranged that he should have six hundred francs a year for two
                        years, instead of three hundred francs for four years. Barezzi himself
                        advanced the money for the music lessons, board and lodging in Milan
                        and the priest gave him a letter of introduction to his nephew, a
                        professor there, who received him with a hearty welcome, and insisted
                        upon his living with him.
                        Talking the matter over with musicians and friends, he began to
                        interest them in the plan to study the music of the Passion. Soon
                        he had secured sixteen good voices, who rehearsed at his home once
                        a week. His enthusiasm fired them to study the music seriously, and
                        before very long they were anxious to give a public performance.
                        There was a splendid choir of nearly four hundred voices conducted by
                        Zelter, at the Singakademie; if he would only lend his chorus to give
                        a trial performance, under Mendelssohns conducting, how splendid that
                        would be! But Felix knew that Zelter had no faith in the public taking
                        any interest in Bach, so there was no use asking. This opinion was
                        opposed by one of his little choir, named Devrient, who insisted that
                        Zelter should be approached on the subject. As he himself had been
                        a pupil of Zelter, he persuaded Mendelssohn to accompany him to the
                        directors house.
                        A touching episode, told in his vivid way, was the meeting, late in
                        life, with his adored Estelle of the pink shoes. He called on her and
                        found a quiet widow, who had lost both husband and children. They
                        had a poignant hour of reminiscence and corresponded for some time
                        afterwards."

  communication_note: "The introduction represents Don Quixote buried in books of chivalrous
                        romance; and we have to see in the music, as we do in little Flemish and
                        Dutch pictures, not only Don Quixotes features, but the words of the
                        books he reads. Sometimes it is the story of a knight who is righting a
                        giant, sometimes the adventures of a knight-errant who has dedicated
                        himself to the services of a lady, sometimes it is a nobleman who has
                        given his life in fulfilment of a vow to atone for his sins. Don
                        Quixotes mind becomes confused (and our own with it) over all these
                        stories; he is quite distracted. He leaves home in company with his
                        squire. The two figures are drawn with great spirit; the one is an old
                        Spaniard, stiff, languishing, distrustful, a bit of a poet, rather
                        undecided in his opinions but obstinate when his mind is once made up;
                        the other is a fat, jovial peasant, a cunning fellow, given to repeating
                        himself in a waggish way and quoting droll proverbs--translated in the
                        music by short-winded phrases that always return to the point they
                        started from. The adventures begin. Here are the windmills (trills from
                        the violins and wood wind), and the bleating army of the grand emperor,
                        Alifanfaron (tremolos from the wood wind); and here, in the third
                        variation, is a dialogue between the knight and his squire, from which
                        we are to guess that Sancho questions his master on the advantages of a
                        chivalrous life, for they seem to him doubtful. Don Quixote talks to him
                        of glory and honour; but Sancho has no thought for it. In reply to these
                        grand words he urges the superiority of sure profits, fat meals, and
                        sounding money. Then the adventures begin again. The two companions fly
                        through the air on wooden horses; and the illusion of this giddy voyage
                        is given by chromatic passages on the flutes, harps, kettledrums, and a
                        \x22windmachine,\x22 while \x22the tremolo of the double basses on the key-note
                        shows that the horses have never left the earth.\x22[177]
                        \x22The Flying Dutchman\x22 was produced at the Dresden Opera House January
                        2. 1843, with Mme. Schroeder-Devrient as Senta. Critics and public
                        had expected a brilliant and imposing spectacle like \x22Rienzi\x22 and were
                        disappointed. In the following May and June \x22The Dutchman\x22 was heard
                        in Riga and Cassel, conducted by the famous violinist and composer,
                        Spohr.
                        A short time after this, there was a mass at a chapel in Busseto,
                        where the Canon had the service. The organist was unable to attend,
                        and Verdi was called at the last moment to take his place. Very much
                        impressed with the unusually beautiful organ music, the priest, at the
                        close of the service desired to see the organist. His astonishment was
                        great when he saw his scholar whom he had been seeking to turn from
                        the study of music. \x22Whose music did you play?\x22 he asked. \x22It was most
                        beautiful.\x22
                        Then follows a real scene in fairyland. Vita stands before the sea and
                        invokes it in an incantation full of weird and beautiful vocal music:
                        \x22O sea! Sinister sea with your angry charm, gentle sea with your kiss of
                        death, hear me!\x22 And the sea replies in a song. Voices mingle with the
                        orchestra in a symphony of increasing anger. Vita swears she will give
                        herself to no one but the Stranger. She lifts the emerald above her
                        head, and it shines with a lurid light. \x22Receive, O sea, as a token of
                        my oath, the sacred stone, the holy emerald! Then may its power be no
                        longer invoked, and none may know again its protecting virtue. Jealous
                        sea, take back your own, the last offering of a betrothed! With an
                        impressive gesture she throws the emerald into the waves, and a dark
                        green light suddenly shines out against the black sky. This supernatural
                        light slowly spreads over the water until it reaches the horizon, and
                        the sea begins to roll in great billows.\x22 Then the sea takes up its song
                        in an angrier tone; the orchestra thunders, and the storm bursts."

  communication_subject: "It was a happy household that retired that night."
  communication_note: "The Classical misunderstanding is quite as dangerous. By that I mean the
                        clinging to superstitions of the past, and the pedantic desire to
                        enclose art within narrow limits, which still flourish among critics.
                        Who has not met these censors of music? They will tell you with solid
                        complacence how far music may go, and where it must stop, and what it
                        may express and what it must not. They are not always musicians
                        themselves. But what of that? Do they not lean on the example of the
                        past? The past! a handful of works that they themselves hardly
                        understand. Meanwhile, music, by its unceasing growth, gives the lie to
                        their theories, and breaks down these weak barriers. But they do not see
                        it, do not wish to see it; since they cannot advance themselves, they
                        deny progress. Critics of this kind do not think favourably of Berliozs
                        dramatic and descriptive symphonies. How should they appreciate the
                        boldest musical achievement of the nineteenth century? These dreadful
                        pedants and zealous defenders of an art that they only understand after
                        it has ceased to live are the worst enemies of unfettered genius, and
                        may do more harm than a whole army of ignorant people. For in a country
                        like ours, where musical education is poor, timidity is great in the
                        presence of a strong, but only half-understood, tradition; and anyone
                        who has the boldness to break away from it is condemned without
                        judgment. I doubt if Berlioz would have obtained any consideration at
                        all from lovers of classical music in France if he had not found allies
                        in that country of classical music, Germany--\x22the oracle of Delphi,\x22
                        \x22Germania alma parens,\x22[2] as he called her. Some of the young German
                        school found inspiration in Berlioz. The dramatic symphony that he
                        created flourished in its German form under Liszt; the most eminent
                        German composer of to-day, Richard Strauss, came under his influence;
                        and Felix Weingartner, who with Charles Malherbe edited Berliozs
                        complete works, was bold enough to write, \x22In spite of Wagner and Liszt,
                        we should not be where we are if Berlioz had not lived.\x22 This unexpected
                        support, coming from a country of traditions, has thrown the partisans
                        of Classic tradition into confusion, and rallied Berliozs friends.
                        Mr. Stokowski is inordinately fond of gadgets and fancies himself as
                        quite a technical expert. When he first conducted for the radio he
                        strenuously objected to the arrangement whereby the engineers in the
                        control room had the last word as to the volume of sound that was to
                        go out on the air.
                        Outside of his official duties his passion for work again gained the
                        ascendent. From November 2, to December 9, he sketched and completed
                        the Symphony in E flat in five parts, a great work, equal to any of
                        the other works in this form.
                        \x22I am weary of life; and I am forced to see that belief in
                        absurdities is necessary to human minds, and that it is born in
                        them as insects are born in swamps.\x22[40]"

                        With the success of \x22Nabucco\x22 Verdis career as a composer may be
                        said to have begun. In the following year \x22I Lombardi\x22 was produced,
                        followed by \x22Ernani.\x22 Then came in quick succession ten more operas,

                        The story of Chopins attraction for Marie Wodzinski and his reported
                        engagement to her, is soon told. During his visit in Dresden, after
                        leaving his parents in Carlsbad, he saw much of his old friends, Count
                        Wodzinski and his family. The daughter, Marie, aged nineteen, was
                        tall and slender, not beautiful but charming, with soft dark hair and
                        soulful eyes. Chopin spent all his evenings at their home and saw much
                        of Marie. The last evening the girl gave him a rose, and he composed a
                        valse for her.
                        But the best of his teaching lies in his life. One can never speak too
                        highly of his disinterested devotion for the good of art. As if it were
                        not enough to put all his might into his own creations, M. dIndy gives
                        his time and the results of his study unsparingly to others. Franck gave
                        lessons in order to be able to live; M. dIndy gives them for the
                        pleasure of instructing, and to serve his art and aid artists. He
                        directs schools, and accepts and almost seeks out the most thankless,
                        though the most necessary, kinds of teaching. Or he will apply himself
                        devoutly to the study of the past and the resuscitation of some old
                        master. And he seems to take so much pleasure in training young minds to
                        appreciate music, or in repairing the injustices of history to some fine
                        but forgotten musician, that he almost forgets about himself. To what
                        work or to what worker, worthy of interest, or seeming to be so, has he
                        ever refused his advice and help? I have known his kindness personally,
                        and I shall always be sincerely grateful for it."

                        much of Johannes. All four gave concerts together, and Johannes took

                        wonderfully played by the composer; it seemed like a miracle. The
                        composition is so difficult that none but a great artist can attempt
                        it.\x22 So wrote a listener at the time. That was in 1861. We know this
                        wonderful work in these days, for all the present time artists perform
                        it. At each of Frau Schumanns three appearances in Hamburg during the
                        autumn of this year, she performed one of Brahms larger compositions;
                        one of them was the Handel Variations.
                        In 1820, when Giuseppe was seven years old, Carlo Verdi committed a
                        great extravagance for an innkeeper; he bought a spinet for his son,
                        something very unheard of for so poor a man to do.
                        Tschaikowsky was now thirty-five. Most of his time was given to the
                        Conservatoire, where he often worked nine hours a day. Besides, he had
                        written a book on harmony, and was contributing articles on music to
                        two journals. In composition he had produced large works, including
                        up to this time, two Symphonies, two Operas, the Concerto, two String
                        Quartets and numerous smaller pieces. To accomplish such an amount
                        of work, he must have possessed immense energy and devotion to his
                        ideals.
                        The more one learns of the history of great artists, the more one is
                        struck by the immense amount of sadness their lives enclose. Not only
                        are they subjected to the trials and disappointments of ordinary
                        life--which affect them more cruelly through their greater
                        sensitiveness--but their surroundings are like a desert, because they
                        are twenty, thirty, fifty, or even hundreds of years in advance of their
                        contemporaries; and they are often condemned to despairing efforts, not
                        to conquer the world, but to live."

  communication_note: "[Footnote 242: Of late years there has been a veritable outburst of
                        concerts at popular prices--some of them in imitation of the German
                        _Restaurationskonzerte_, such as the Concerts-Rouge, the
                        Concerts-Touche, etc., where classical and modern symphony music may be
                        heard. These concerts are increasing fast, and have great success among
                        a public that is almost exclusively _bourgeois_, but they are yet a long
                        way behind the popular performances of Haendel in London, where places
                        may be had for sixpence and threepence.
                        Mr. Koussevitzys conductorial gestures are literally high, wide and
                        handsome. His wing-spread, so to speak, is much larger than that of
                        either Mr. Stokowski or Mr. Toscanini, and he has a greater repertoire
                        of unpredictable motions than both of them put together. Time cannot
                        wither, nor custom stale, the infinite variety of his shadow boxing.
                        From these stories there emerged a demoniacal little man with the
                        tantrums of a dozen prima donnas, a temperamental tyrant who, at
                        the dropping of a stitch in the orchestral knitting, tore his hair,
                        screamed at the top of his inexhaustible Latin lungs, doused his
                        trembling players with streams of blistering invective.
                        Then, in 1890, there were signs of a movement that was in revolt against
                        its despotism. The great wind from the East began to drop, and veered to
                        the North. Scandinavian and Russian influences were making themselves
                        felt. An exaggerated infatuation for Grieg, though limited to a small
                        number of people, was an indication of the change in public taste. In
                        1890, Cesar Franck died in Paris. Belgian by birth and temperament, and
                        French in feeling and by musical education, he had remained outside the
                        Wagnerian movement in his own serene and fecund solitude. To his
                        intellectual greatness and the charm his personal genius held for the
                        little band of friends who knew and revered him he added the authority
                        of his knowledge. Unconsciously he brought back to us the soul of
                        Sebastian Bach, with its infinite richness and depth; and through this
                        he found himself the head of a school (without having wished it) and the
                        greatest teacher of contemporary French music. After his death, his
                        name was the means of rallying together the younger school of
                        musicians. In 1892, the _Chanteurs de Saint-Gervais_, under the
                        direction of M. Charles Bordes, reinstated to honour and popularised
                        Gregorian and Palestrinian music; and, following the initiative of their
                        director, the _Schola Cantorum_ was founded in 1894 for the revival of
                        religious music. Ambition grew with success; and from the _Schola_
                        sprang the _Ecole Superieure de Musique_, under the direction of
                        Francks most famous pupil, M. Vincent dIndy. This school, founded on a
                        solid knowledge, not only of the classics, but of the primitives in
                        music, took from its very beginning in 1900 a frankly national
                        character, and was in some ways opposed to German art. At the same time,
                        performances of Bach and seventeenth-and eighteenth-century music became
                        more and more frequent; and more intimate relationship with the artists
                        of other countries, repeated visits of the great _Kapellmeister_,
                        foreign virtuosi and composers (especially Richard Strauss), and,
                        lastly, of Russian composers, completed the education of the Parisian
                        musical public, who, after repeated rebukes from the critics, became
                        conscious of the awakening of a national personality, and of an
                        impatient desire to free itself from German tutelage. By turns it
                        gratefully and warmly received M. Bruneaus _Le Reve_ (1891), M.
                        dIndys _Fervaal_ (1898), M. Gustave Charpentiers _Louise_ (1900)--all
                        of which seemed like works of liberation. But, as a matter of fact,
                        these lyric dramas were by no means free from foreign influences, and
                        especially from Wagnerian influences. M. Debussys _Pelleas et
                        Melisande_, in 1902, seemed to mark more truly the emancipation of
                        French music. From this time on, French music felt that it had left
                        school, and claimed to have founded a new art, which reflected the
                        spirit of the race, and was freer and suppler than the Wagnerian art.
                        These ideas, which were seized upon and enlarged by the press, brought
                        about rather quickly a conviction in French artists of Frances
                        superiority in music. Is that conviction justified? The future alone can
                        tell us. But one may see by this brief outline of events how real is the
                        evolution of the musical spirit in France since 1870, in spite of the
                        apparent contradictions of fashion which appear on the surface of art.
                        It is the spirit of France that is, after long oppression and by a
                        patient but eager initiation, realising its power and wishing to
                        dominate in its turn."

                        setting an antiphon in four parts. Wolfgang was locked in a room till
                        the task should be finished. To the astonishment of everybody he asked

                        editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.

                        Think of the effect that such works must have produced at that period.
                        Berlioz was the first to be astonished when he heard them for the first
                        time. At the _Ouverture des Francs-Juges_ he wept and tore his hair, and
                        fell sobbing on the kettledrums. At the performance of his _Tuba mirum_,
                        in Berlin, he nearly fainted. The composer who most nearly approached
                        him was Weber, and, as we have already seen, Berlioz only knew him late
                        in life. But how much less rich and complex is Webers music, in spite
                        of its nervous brilliance and dreaming poetry. Above all, Weber is much
                        more mundane and more of a classicist; he lacks Berliozs revolutionary
                        passion and plebeian force; he is less expressive and less grand.
                        Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
                        assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tms

  communication_note: "Berlioz was disheartened. Life had conquered him. It was not that he had
                        lost any of his artistic mastery; on the contrary, his compositions
                        became more and more finished; and nothing in his earlier work attained
                        the pure beauty of some of the pages of _LEnfance du Christ_ (1850-4),
                        or of _Les Troyens_ (1855-63). But he was losing his power; and his
                        intense feeling, his revolutionary ideas, and his inspiration (which in
                        his youth had taken the place of the confidence he lacked) were failing
                        him. He now lived on the past--the _Huit scenes de Faust_ (1828) held
                        the germs of _La Damnation de Faust_ (1846); since 1833, he had been
                        thinking of _Beatrice et Benedict_ (1862); the ideas in _Les Troyens_
                        were inspired by his childish worship of Virgil, and had been with him
                        all his life. But with what difficulty he now finished his task! He had
                        only taken seven months to write _Romeo_, and \x22on account of not being
                        able to write the _Requiem_ fast enough, he had adopted a kind of
                        musical shorthand\x22;[63] but he took seven or eight years to write _Les
                        Troyens_, alternating between moods of enthusiasm and disgust, and
                        feeling indifference and doubt about his work. He groped his way
                        hesitatingly and unsteadily; he hardly understood what he was doing. He
                        admired the more mediocre pages of his work: the scene of the Laocoon,
                        the finale of the last act of the _Les Troyens a Troie_, the last scene
                        with Aeneas in _Les Troyens a Carthage_.[64] The empty pomposities of
                        Spontini mingle with the loftiest conceptions. One might say that his
                        genius became a stranger to him: it was the mechanical work of an
                        unconscious force, like \x22stalactites in a dripping grotto.\x22 He had no
                        impetus. It was only a matter of time before the roof of the grotto
                        would give way. One is struck with the mournful despair with which he
                        works; it is his last will and testament that he is making. And when he
                        has finished it, he will have finished everything. His work is ended; if
                        he lived another hundred years he would not have the heart to add
                        anything more to it. The only thing that remains--and it is what he is
                        about to do--is to wrap himself in silence and die.
                        Edwards knowledge of French was very uncertain, and while he could
                        get along fairly well in the piano class, he had considerable trouble
                        in following the lessons in theory. He determined to make a special
                        study of the language, and a teacher was engaged to give him private
                        lessons."

                        hope of bettering these unhappy conditions, Frau Beethoven undertook
                        a trip through Holland with her boy, hoping that his playing in the
                        homes of the wealthy might produce some money. The tour was successful
                        in that it relieved the pressing necessities of the moment, but the
                        sturdy, independent spirit of the boy showed itself even then. \x22The
                        Dutch are very stingy, and I shall take care not to trouble them
                        again,\x22 he remarked to a friend.

                        state. There was no rest for him here, as official duties were
                        pressing. The malady afflicting his lungs had made rapid progress and
                        he began to fear he should not be long spared to his wife and little
                        ones.
                        But dreams were turned into deeds before long, for the child tried to
                        set down on paper the little melodies that haunted him. It is said he
                        began to do this at the age of nine. A really serious attempt was
                        made when he was twelve or thirteen. This was a set of variations for
                        piano, on a German melody. He brought it to school one day to show one
                        of the boys. The teacher caught sight of it and reprimanded the young
                        composer soundly, for thus idling his time. It seems that in school he
                        was fond of dreaming away the hours, just as he did at the piano."

                        which, in those early Soviet days, were at low musical ebb. He labored
                        in that job for three years, from 1917 to 1920, but he was out of

  communication_note: "Soon after he began his professorship in Moscow, he composed a Concert
                        Overture in C minor. To his surprise and disappointment, Rubinstein
                        disapproved of the work in every way. This was a shock, after the lack
                        of encouragement in St. Petersburg. But he recovered his poise, though
                        he made up his mind to try his next work in St. Petersburg instead of
                        Moscow. He called the new piece a Symphonic Poem, \x22Winter Daydreams,\x22
                        but it is now known as the First Symphony, Op. 13. About the end of
                        1866, he started out with it, only to be again rebuffed and cast down.
                        The two men whose good opinion he most desired, Anton Rubinstein and
                        Professor Zaremba, could find nothing good in his latest work, and
                        the young composer returned to Moscow to console himself with renewed
                        efforts in composition. Two years later the \x22Winter Daydreams\x22
                        Symphony was produced in Moscow with great success, and its author
                        was much encouraged by this appreciation. He was, like most composers,
                        very sensitive to criticism and had a perfect dread of controversy.
                        Efforts to engage him in arguments of this sort only made him withdraw
                        into himself.
                        And it would have been more seemly if in this three-day festival the
                        organisers had had the courteousness to devote the first day to French
                        music, and had set aside one whole concert for it. But, without doubt,
                        they had carefully sandwiched the French works in between German works
                        to weaken their effect, and lessen the probable (and actual) enthusiasm
                        with which French music would be received in the presence of the
                        Statthalter of Alsace-Lorraine by a section of the Alsatian public. In
                        addition to this, and by a choice that neither myself nor anyone else in
                        Strasburg could believe was dictated by musical reasons, the German work
                        chosen to end the evening was the final scene from _Die Meistersinger_,
                        with its ringing couplet from Hans Sachs, in which he denounces foreign
                        insincerity and foreign frivolity (_Waelschen Dunst mit waelschen Tand_).
                        This lack of courtesy--though the words were really nonsense when this
                        very concert was given to show that foreign art could not be
                        ignored--would not be worth while raking up if it did not further serve
                        to show how regrettable is the indifference of French artists who take
                        part in these festivals. And this mistake would never have occurred if
                        they had taken care to acquaint themselves with the programme beforehand
                        and put their veto upon it."

  communication_note: "The tests for organ prizes have always been four. First, the
                        accompaniment of a plain chant, chosen for the occasion; second, the
                        performance of an organ piece with pedals; third, the improvising of
                        a fugue; fourth, improvising a piece in sonata form. Both the
                        improvisations to be on themes set by the examiners. Cesar at once
                        noticed that the two themes could be combined in such a way that one
                        would set off the other. He set to work, and soon became so absorbed
                        in this interweaving of melodies that the improvisation extended to
                        unaccustomed lengths, which bewildered the examiners and they decided
                        to award nothing to such a tiresome boy. Benoist, teacher of this
                        ingenious pupil, explained matters with the result that Cesar was
                        awarded a second prize for organ.
                        Thus passed from sight one of the most astonishing musicians of all
                        time. He lives in his music more vitally than when his bodily presence
                        was on earth, since the world becomes more familiar with his music as
                        time goes on. And to know this music is to admire and love it.
                        Then, in 1890, there were signs of a movement that was in revolt against
                        its despotism. The great wind from the East began to drop, and veered to
                        the North. Scandinavian and Russian influences were making themselves
                        felt. An exaggerated infatuation for Grieg, though limited to a small
                        number of people, was an indication of the change in public taste. In
                        1890, Cesar Franck died in Paris. Belgian by birth and temperament, and
                        French in feeling and by musical education, he had remained outside the
                        Wagnerian movement in his own serene and fecund solitude. To his
                        intellectual greatness and the charm his personal genius held for the
                        little band of friends who knew and revered him he added the authority
                        of his knowledge. Unconsciously he brought back to us the soul of
                        Sebastian Bach, with its infinite richness and depth; and through this
                        he found himself the head of a school (without having wished it) and the
                        greatest teacher of contemporary French music. After his death, his
                        name was the means of rallying together the younger school of
                        musicians. In 1892, the _Chanteurs de Saint-Gervais_, under the
                        direction of M. Charles Bordes, reinstated to honour and popularised
                        Gregorian and Palestrinian music; and, following the initiative of their
                        director, the _Schola Cantorum_ was founded in 1894 for the revival of
                        religious music. Ambition grew with success; and from the _Schola_
                        sprang the _Ecole Superieure de Musique_, under the direction of
                        Francks most famous pupil, M. Vincent dIndy. This school, founded on a
                        solid knowledge, not only of the classics, but of the primitives in
                        music, took from its very beginning in 1900 a frankly national
                        character, and was in some ways opposed to German art. At the same time,
                        performances of Bach and seventeenth-and eighteenth-century music became
                        more and more frequent; and more intimate relationship with the artists
                        of other countries, repeated visits of the great _Kapellmeister_,
                        foreign virtuosi and composers (especially Richard Strauss), and,
                        lastly, of Russian composers, completed the education of the Parisian
                        musical public, who, after repeated rebukes from the critics, became
                        conscious of the awakening of a national personality, and of an
                        impatient desire to free itself from German tutelage. By turns it
                        gratefully and warmly received M. Bruneaus _Le Reve_ (1891), M.
                        dIndys _Fervaal_ (1898), M. Gustave Charpentiers _Louise_ (1900)--all
                        of which seemed like works of liberation. But, as a matter of fact,
                        these lyric dramas were by no means free from foreign influences, and
                        especially from Wagnerian influences. M. Debussys _Pelleas et
                        Melisande_, in 1902, seemed to mark more truly the emancipation of
                        French music. From this time on, French music felt that it had left
                        school, and claimed to have founded a new art, which reflected the
                        spirit of the race, and was freer and suppler than the Wagnerian art.
                        These ideas, which were seized upon and enlarged by the press, brought
                        about rather quickly a conviction in French artists of Frances
                        superiority in music. Is that conviction justified? The future alone can
                        tell us. But one may see by this brief outline of events how real is the
                        evolution of the musical spirit in France since 1870, in spite of the
                        apparent contradictions of fashion which appear on the surface of art.
                        It is the spirit of France that is, after long oppression and by a
                        patient but eager initiation, realising its power and wishing to
                        dominate in its turn.
                        That same humility, that same incurable bewilderment at public acclaim
                        must have been apparent to all who ever attended a Toscanini concert,
                        saw him at the close of a superb interpretation bowing as one of the
                        group of players and making deprecating gestures that seemed to
                        say: \x22What you have heard was a great score brought to life by these
                        excellent musicians--why applaud me?\x22"

                        orgue_, he still remained aloof from praise or blame, and judged his
                        triumphs with sad severity:
                        The characters of Tristan and Iseult are primarily taken from a French
                        legend. Debussy felt the story was a French heritage and should be
                        restored to its original atmosphere and idea. This it was his ardent
                        desire to accomplish.
                        Before this honor was achieved, however, a new influence came into his
                        life, which for a time overshadowed the passion for Shakespeare and
                        Miss Smithson. It happened on this wise.
                        But what joy there is when these deeds of faith have been
                        performed--when Jesus has cured the possessed man, or when Lazarus has
                        opened his eyes to the light. The heart of the multitude overflows
                        perhaps in rather childish thanksgiving; and at first it seemed to me
                        expressed in a commonplace way. But did not the joy of all great artists
                        so express itself?--the joy of Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach, who, when
                        once they had thrown their cares aside, knew how to amuse themselves
                        like the rest of the populace. And the simple phrase at the beginning
                        soon assumes fuller proportions, the harmonies gain in richness, a
                        glowing ardour fills the music, and a chorale blends with the dances in
                        triumphant majesty."

  communication_note: "\x22There is no need to mention the excessive bureaucracy and
                        officialism which is the crying evil of this country. We find
                        everywhere submission to rules and servitude to the State. But what
                        government, pope, emperor, or president could oblige an artist to
                        think and write against his will? Liberty--that is the true wealth
                        and the most precious inheritance of the artist, the liberty to
                        think, and the liberty that no one has the power to take away from
                        us--that of doing our work according to the dictates of our
                        conscience.\x22
                        Of all the characteristics of Francks fine moral nature, the most
                        remarkable was his religious faith. It must have astonished the artists
                        of his time, who were even more destitute of such a thing than they are
                        now. It made itself felt in some of his followers, especially in those
                        who were near the masters heart, as M. dIndy was. The religious
                        thought of the latter reflects in some degree the thought of his master;
                        though the shape of that thought may have undergone unconscious
                        alteration. I do not know if Franck altogether fits the conception
                        people have of him to-day. I do not want to introduce personal memories
                        of him here. I knew him well enough to love him, and to catch a glimpse
                        of the beauty and sincerity of his soul; but I did not know him well
                        enough to discover the secrets of his mind. Those who had the happiness
                        of being his intimate friends seem always to represent him as a mystic
                        who shut himself away from the spirit of his time. I hope at some future
                        date one of his friends will publish some of the conversations that he
                        had with him, of which I have heard. But this man who had so strong a
                        faith was also very independent. In his religion he had no doubts: it
                        was the mainspring of his life; though faith with him was much more a
                        matter of feeling than a matter of doctrine. But all was feeling with
                        Franck, and reason made little appeal to him. His religious faith did
                        not disturb his mind, for he did not measure men and their works by its
                        rules; and he would have been incapable of putting together a history of
                        art according to the Bible. This great Catholic had at times a very
                        pagan soul; and he could enjoy without a qualm the musical dilettantism
                        of Renan and the sonorous nihilism of Leconte de Lisle. There were no
                        limits to his vast sympathies. He did not attempt to criticise the thing
                        he loved--understanding was already in his heart. Perhaps he was right;
                        and perhaps there was more trouble in the depths of his heart than the
                        valiant serenity of its surface would lead us to believe."

  communication_note: "How much finer, to my idea, are Berliozs recitatives, with their long
                        and winding rhythms,[91] than Wagners declamations, which--apart from
                        the climax of a subject, where the air breaks into bold and vigorous
                        phrases, whose influence elsewhere is often weak--limit themselves to
                        the quasi-notation of spoken inflections, and jar noisily against the
                        fine harmonies of the orchestra. Berliozs orchestration, too, is of a
                        more delicate temper, and has a freer life than Wagners, flowing in an
                        impetuous stream, and sweeping away everything in its course; it is also
                        less united and solid, but more flexible; its nature is undulating and
                        varied, and the thousand imperceptible impulses of the spirit and of
                        action are reflected there. It is a marvel of spontaneity and caprice.
                        When Felix returned to Berlin, he had grown much, physically as well
                        as mentally. He was now tall and strong, his curling locks had been
                        clipped, and he seemed at a single bound to have become almost a man.
                        His happy, boyish spirits, however, had not changed in the least.
                        About this time the family removed from their home on the Neue
                        Promenade, to a larger and more stately mansion, No. 3 Leipsiger
                        Strasse, then situated on the outskirts of the town, near the Potsdam
                        Gate. As those who know the modern city realize, this house, now no
                        longer a private residence, stands in the very heart of traffic and
                        business. The rooms of the new home were large and elegant, with
                        a spacious salon suitable for musicals and large functions. A fine
                        garden or park belonged to the house, where were lawns shaded by
                        forest trees, winding paths, flowering shrubs and arbors in shady
                        nooks, offering quiet retreats. Best of all there was a garden house,
                        with a central hall, which would hold several hundred people, having
                        long windows and glass doors looking out upon the trees and flowers.
                        Sunday concerts were soon resumed and given in the garden house,
                        where, on week days the young people met, with friends and elders, to
                        play, and act and enjoy the social life of the home. The mansion and
                        its hospitality became famous, and every great musician, at one time
                        or another, came to pay his respects and become acquainted with this
                        art-loving family.

                        installed itself in the ancient chapel of the Dominicans of the

                        1851, was finished in two years, but he paid dearly for all this extra
                        labor. He fell ill--a state of nervous prostration--and was unable for
                        some time to compose at all."

  communication_note: "Such a feat was unheard of and quite against the time-honored rules of
                        competition. And to think it had been performed by an audacious
                        slip of a boy of fifteen! The aged Director, none other than Maestro
                        Cherubini, was shocked out of the even tenor of his way, and declared
                        that a first prize could not be awarded, although he must have
                        realized the lad deserved it. To make amends, however, he proposed
                        a special award to the audacious young pianist, outside the regular
                        competition, to be known as \x22The Grand Prize of Honor.\x22 This was the
                        first time, and so far as is known, the only time such a prize has
                        been awarded.
                        It is not, however, Perosis dramatic genius that strikes me in his
                        work; it is rather his peculiar mournfulness, which is indescribable,
                        his gift of pure poetry, and the richness of his flowing melody. However
                        deep the religious feeling in the music may be, the music itself is
                        often stronger still, and breaks in upon the drama that it may express
                        itself freely. Take, for instance, the fine symphonic passage that
                        follows the arrival of Jesus and His friends at Martha and Marys house,
                        after the death of their brother (p. 12 _et seq._ of _Lazarus_). It is
                        true the orchestra expresses regrets and sighs, the excesses of sorrow
                        mingled with words of consolation and faith, in a sort of languishing
                        funeral march that is feminine and Christian in character. This,
                        according to the composer, is a picture he has painted of the persons in
                        the drama before he makes them speak. But, in spite of himself, the
                        result is a flood of pure music, and his soul sings its own song of joy
                        and sadness. Sometimes his spirit, in its naive and delicate charm,
                        recalls that of Mozart; but his musical visions are always dominated and
                        directed by a religious strength like that of Bach. Even the portions
                        where the dramatic feeling is strongest are really little symphonies,
                        such as the music that describes the miracle in _The Transfiguration_,
                        and the illness of Lazarus. In the latter great depth of suffering is
                        expressed; indeed, sadness could not have been carried farther even by
                        Bach, and the same serenity of mind runs through its despair.
                        Natalya, the daughter of a wealthy merchant and a rich girl in her own
                        right, promised him anything he wanted for a wedding gift. \x22Give me a
                        symphony orchestra.\x22 was Koussevitzkys startling request. The bride
                        was taken aback, for it was with the bull fiddle that he had wooed and
                        won her and she hated to see him give it up, but she kept her word.
                        Thus it came about that early in May, 1845, Hannes had his first taste
                        of the delights of the country. He had provided himself with a small
                        dumb keyboard, to exercise his fingers upon. Every morning, after he
                        had done what was necessary in the house, Hannes was sent afield by
                        the kind mistress of the household, and told not to show himself till
                        dinner time. Perhaps the good mistress did not know that Hannes had
                        enjoyed himself out of doors hours before. He used to rise at four
                        oclock and begin his day with a bath in the river. Shortly after this
                        the little girl, Lischen, would join him and they would spend a couple
                        of hours rambling about, looking for birds nests, hunting butterflies
                        and picking wild flowers. Hannes pale cheeks soon became plump and
                        ruddy, as the result of fresh air and country food. Musical work
                        went right on as usual. Studies in theory and composition, begun with
                        Marxsen, were pursued regularly in the fields and woods all summer."

                        One of the most tragic episodes of his life is that of the symphony
                        which he did not write because of his poverty. One wonders why the page
                        that finishes his _Memoires_ is not better known, for it touches the
                        depths of human suffering."

  communication_note: "These fatalistic ideas, reflecting the lassitude of the intellectual
                        aristocracy of Europe, have been wonderfully translated into music by
                        Debussy; and when you feel the poetic and sensual charm of the music,
                        the ideas become fascinating and intoxicating, and their spirit is very
                        infectious. For there is in all music an hypnotic power which is able to
                        reduce the mind to a state of voluptuous submission.
                        Above all, I fear Mahler has been sadly hypnotised by ideas about
                        power--ideas that are getting to the head of all German artists to-day.
                        He seems to have an undecided mind, and to combine sadness and irony
                        with weakness and impatience, to be a Viennese musician striving after
                        Wagnerian grandeur. No one expresses the grace of _Laendler_ and dainty
                        waltzes and mournful reveries better than he; and perhaps no one is
                        nearer the secret of Schuberts moving and voluptuous melancholy; and it
                        is Schubert he recalls at times, both in his good qualities and certain
                        of his faults. But he wants to be Beethoven or Wagner. And he is wrong;
                        for he lacks their balance and gigantic force. One saw that only too
                        well when he was conducting the _Choral Symphony_.

                        short in stature and of youthful appearance, with a head a little too
                        big for his body, and open and regular features lighted up by
                        intelligent black eyes, his only peculiarity being a projecting
                        underlip."

  communication_note: "Soon after this Count Borromes engaged Verdi to write a Cantata for
                        chorus and orchestra, to honor the occasion of a marriage in the
                        family. Verdi did so but was never paid a sou for his work. The next
                        request was from Masini, who urged Verdi to compose an opera for
                        the Teatro Filodramatico, where he was conductor. He handed him a
                        libretto, which with a few alterations here and there became \x22Oberto,
                        Conte di San Bonifacio.\x22 Verdi accepted the offer at once, and being
                        obliged to move to Busseto, where he had been appointed organist,
                        remained there nearly three years, during which time the opera was
                        completed. On returning to Milan he found Masini no longer conductor,
                        and lost all hope of seeing the new opera produced. After long waiting
                        however, the impressario sent for him, and promised to bring out the
                        work the next season, if the composer would make a few changes. Young
                        and as yet unknown, Verdi was quite willing. \x22Oberto\x22 was produced
                        with a fair amount of success, and repeated several times. On the
                        strength of this propitious beginning, the impressario, Merelli, made
                        the young composer an excellent offer--to write three operas, one
                        every eight months, to be performed either in Milan or in Vienna,
                        where he was impressario of both the principal theaters. He promised
                        to pay four thousand lire--about six hundred and seventy dollars--for
                        each, and share the profits of the copyright. To young Verdi this
                        seemed an excellent chance and he accepted at once. Rossi wrote a
                        libretto, entitled \x22Proscritto,\x22 and work on the music was about to
                        begin. In the spring of 1840, Merelli hurried from Vienna, saying he
                        needed a comic opera for the autumn season, and wanted work begun on
                        it at once. He produced three librettos, none of them very good. Verdi
                        did not like them, but since there was no time to lose, chose the
                        least offensive and set to work.
                        M. dIndys personality is not a mysterious one. On the contrary, it is
                        open and clear as daylight; and we see this in his musical work, in his
                        artistic activities, and in his writings. To his own writings we may
                        apply the exception of his rule about criticism in favour of a small
                        number of men whose thoughts are interesting even when they are
                        erroneous. It would be a pity indeed not to know M. dIndys
                        thoughts--even the erroneous ones; for they let us catch a glimpse, not
                        only of the ideas of an eminent artist, but of certain surprising
                        characteristics of the thought of our time. M. dIndy has closely
                        studied the history of his art; but the chief interest of his writings
                        lies rather in their unconscious expression of the spirit of modern art
                        than in what they tell us about the past."

  communication_note: "And I shall not dwell on Berliozs love of Nature, which, as M.
                        Prudhomme shows us, is the soul of a composition like the _Damnation_
                        and, one might say, of all great compositions. No musician, with the
                        exception of Beethoven, has loved Nature so profoundly. Wagner himself
                        did not realise the intensity of emotion which she roused in
                        Berlioz,[73] and how this feeling impregnated the music of the
                        _Damnation_, of _Romeo_, and of _Les Troyens_.
                        To Mozart the thought of settling down in Salzburg under the
                        conditions stated in his fathers letter was distasteful, but he had
                        not the heart to withstand his fathers appeal. He set out from Paris
                        at once, promising himself just one indulgence before entering the
                        bondage which lay before him, a visit to his friends the Webers at
                        Mannheim. When he arrived there he found they had gone to Munich to
                        live. Therefore he pushed on to Munich. The Weber family received him
                        as warmly as of old, but in Aloysias eyes there was only a friendly
                        greeting, nothing more. A few short months had cooled her fickle
                        attachment for the young composer. This discovery was a bitter
                        trial to Wolfgang and he returned to his Salzburg home saddened by
                        disappointed love and ambition.
                        After two years schooling, Giuseppes father persuaded his friend,
                        Antonio Barezzi of Busseto, from whom he was in the habit of buying
                        wines and supplies for his inn and shop,--to take the lad into his
                        warehouse. That was a happy day for Giuseppe when he went to live with
                        Barezzi, who was an enthusiastic amateur of music. The Philharmonic
                        Society, of which Barezzi was the president, met, rehearsed and gave
                        all its concerts at his house.
                        But this is not all. What was the bitterness of failure compared with
                        the great anguish of death? Berlioz saw all those he loved die one after
                        the other: his father, his mother, Henrietta Smithson, Marie Recio. Then
                        only his son Louis remained."

  communication_note: "The boys name was George Frederick Handel, and he was born in the
                        German town of Halle, February 23, 1685. Almost from infancy he showed
                        a remarkable fondness for music. His toys must be able to produce
                        musical sounds or he did not care for them. The child did not inherit
                        a love for music from his father, for Dr. Handel, who was a surgeon,
                        looked on music with contempt, as something beneath the notice of a
                        gentleman. He had decided his son was to be a lawyer, and refused
                        to allow him to attend school for fear some one might teach him his
                        notes. The mother was a sweet gentle woman, a second wife, and much
                        younger than her husband, who seemed to have ruled his household with
                        a rod of iron.
                        He now received constant care, and it was found best to place him in
                        a private hospital near Bonn. Here he remained till the end of July,
                        1856, when the end came.
                        When the boys reached Paris, in 1822, Hector loyally tried to keep his
                        promise to his father and threw himself into the studies which were
                        so repugnant to him. He says he might have become a common-place
                        physician after all, had he not one night gone to the opera. That
                        night was a revelation; he became half frantic with excitement and
                        enthusiasm. He went again and again. Learning that the Conservatoire
                        library, with its wealth of scores, was open to the public, he began
                        to study the scores of his adored Gluck. He read, re-read and copied
                        long parts and scenes from these wonderful scores, even forgetting
                        to eat, drink or sleep, in his wild enthusiasm. Of course, now, the
                        career of doctor must be given up; there was no question of that. He
                        wrote home that in spite of father, mother, relations and friends, a
                        musician he would be and nothing else."

  communication_note: "On reaching home, Verdi pulled the manuscript out and threw it on the
                        writing table. As he did so a stanza from the book caught his eye; it
                        was almost a paraphrase from the Bible, which had been such a solace
                        to him in his solitary life. He began to read the story and was more
                        and more enthralled by it, yet his resolution to write no more was
                        not altered. However, as the days passed there would be here a line
                        written down, there a melody--until at last, almost unconsciously the
                        opera of \x22Nabucco\x22 came into being.
                        The other argument urged against the symphony with a programme is the
                        pretended classical argument (it is not really classical at all).
                        \x22Music,\x22 they say, \x22is not meant to express definite subjects; it is
                        only fitted for vague ideas. The more indefinite it is, the greater its
                        power, and the more it suggests.\x22 I ask, What is an indefinite art? What
                        is a vague art? Do not the two words contradict each other? Can this
                        strange combination exist at all? Can an artist write anything that he
                        does not clearly conceive? Do people think he composes at random as his
                        genius whispers to him? One must at least say this: A symphony of
                        Beethovens is a \x22definite\x22 work down to its innermost folds; and
                        Beethoven had, if not an exact knowledge, at least a clear intuition of
                        what he was about. His last quartets are descriptive symphonies of his
                        soul, and very differently carried out from Berliozs symphonies. Wagner
                        was able to analyse one of the former under the name of \x22A Day with
                        Beethoven.\x22 Beethoven was always trying to translate into music the
                        depths of his heart, the subtleties of his spirit, which are not to be
                        explained clearly by words, but which are as definite as words--in fact,
                        more definite; for a word, being an abstract thing, sums up many
                        experiences and comprehends many different meanings. Music is a hundred
                        times more expressive and exact than speech; and it is not only her
                        right to express particular emotions and subjects, it is her duty. If
                        that duty is not fulfilled, the result is not music--it is nothing at
                        all.
                        \x22Lifes but a walking shadow, a poor player
                        That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
                        And then is heard no more: it is a tale
                        Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
                        Signifying nothing.\x22[53]
                        Well, here is that music; you will nowhere find a more perfect model. It
                        is true that many who profess the principles of this music repudiate
                        the model, and do not hide their disdain for Berlioz. That makes me
                        doubt a little, I admit, the results of their efforts. If they do not
                        feel the wonderful freedom of Berliozs music, and do not see that it
                        was the delicate veil of a very living spirit, then I think there will
                        be more of archaism than real life in their pretensions to \x22free music.\x22
                        Study, not only the most celebrated pages of his work, such as the
                        _Scene damour_ (the one of all his compositions that Berlioz himself
                        liked best),[85] _La Tristesse de Romeo_, or _La Fete des Capulet_
                        (where a spirit like Wagners own unlooses and subdues again tempests of
                        passion and joy), but take less well-known pages, such as the
                        _Scherzetto chante de la reine Mab_, or the _Reveil de Juliette_, and
                        the music describing the death of the two lovers.[86] In the one what
                        light grace there is, in the other what vibrating passion, and in both
                        of them what freedom and apt expression of ideas. The language is
                        magnificent, of wonderful clearness and simplicity; not a word too much,
                        and not a word that does not reveal an unerring pen. In nearly all the
                        big works of Berlioz before 1845 (that is up to the _Damnation_) you
                        will find this nervous precision and sweeping liberty."

                        The boy Christoph, like many another lad who became a great musician,
                        had a sorrowful childhood, full of poverty and neglect. His home was
                        in the little town of Weissenwangen, on the borders of Bohemia, where
                        he was born July 2, 1714. As a little lad he early manifested a love
                        for music, but his parents were in very straitened circumstances and
                        could not afford to pay for musical instruction. He was sent to one of
                        the public schools. Fortunately the art of reading music from notes,
                        formation of scales and fundamentals, was taught along with general
                        school subjects."

                        of completion in the spring of 1846. In a letter to the famous singer
                        Jenny Lind, an intimate friend, he writes: \x22I am jumping about my
                        room for joy. If my work turns out half as good as I fancy it is, how

                        distinguished himself in his studies. The following year he was
                        allowed to take piano lessons of an old pedantic professor from
                        Zwickau High School. This man had taught himself music, but had heard
                        little of it. The kind of instruction he was able to give may be
                        imagined, yet Robert was faithful all his life to this kind old
                        friend.

                        After a year the Kenigsberg Theater failed and again Wagner was out
                        of employment. Through the influence of his friend Dorn, he secured
                        a directorship at Riga, Minna also being engaged at the theater. At
                        first everything went well; the salary was higher and the people among
                        whom they were placed were agreeable. But before long debts began to
                        press again, and Wagner was dissatisfied with the state of the lyric
                        drama, which he was destined to reform in such a wonderful way. He was
                        only twenty-four, and had seen but little of the world. Paris was the
                        goal toward which he looked with longing eyes, and to the gay French
                        capital he determined to go."

                        \x22I am in agony. I have not dared to ask the Pope for anything, because
                        my work does not make sufficient progress to merit any remuneration. The
                        work is too difficult, and indeed it is not my profession. I am wasting
                        my time to no purpose. Heaven help me!\x22 For a year he had been working
                        at the ceiling of the Sixtine chapel.
                        At SantAgata the master lived a quiet, retired life. The estate was
                        situated about two miles from Busseto, and was very large, with a
                        great park, a large collection of horses and other live stock. The
                        residence was spacious, and the masters special bedroom was on the
                        first floor. It was large, light and airy and luxuriously furnished.
                        Here stood a magnificent grand piano, and the composer often rose in
                        the night to jot down the themes which came to him in the silence of
                        the midnight hours. Here \x22Don Carlos\x22 was written. In one of the upper
                        rooms stood the old spinet that Verdi hacked at as a child.
                        Amid all this labor his public playing had to be given up, but
                        composition went steadily on. During the eight years of the Columbia
                        professorship, some of the most important works of his life were
                        produced; among them were, Sea Pieces the two later Sonatas, the Norse
                        and the Keltic, Fireside Tales, and New England Idyls. The Woodland
                        Sketches had already been published and some of his finest songs.
                        Indeed nearly one quarter of all his compositions were the fruit of
                        those eight years while he held the post at Columbia.
                        Frau Schumann returned to Desseldorf the next day, accompanied by
                        Brahms and Joachim. Together they set in order the papers left by the
                        composer, and assisted the widow in many little ways. A little later
                        she went to Switzerland to recover her strength, accompanied by
                        Brahms and his sister Elise. A number of weeks were spent in rest and
                        recuperation. By October the three musicians were ready to take up
                        their ordinary routine again. Frau Clara began practising for her
                        concert season, Joachim returned to his post in Hanover, and Johann
                        turned his face toward Hamburg, giving some concerts on the way, in
                        which he achieved pronounced success."

  communication_note: "In Germany, however, they make no mistake about him. There, the name of
                        Camille Saint-Saens stands for the French classical spirit, and is
                        thought worthiest to represent us in music from the time of Berlioz
                        until the appearance of the young school of Cesar Franck--though Franck
                        himself is as yet little known in Germany. M. Saint-Saens possesses,
                        indeed, some of the best qualities of a French artist, and among them
                        the most important quality of all--perfect clearness of conception. It
                        is remarkable how little this learned artist is bothered by his
                        learning, and how free he is from all pedantry. Pedantry is the plague
                        of German art, and the greatest men have not escaped it. I am not
                        speaking of Brahms, who was ravaged with it, but of delightful geniuses
                        like Schumann, or of powerful ones like Bach. \x22This unnatural art
                        wearies one like the sanctimonious salon of some little provincial town;
                        it stifles one, it is enough to kill one.\x22[117] \x22Saint-Saens is not a
                        pedant,\x22 wrote Gounod; \x22he has remained too much of a child and become
                        too clever for that.\x22 Besides, he has always been too much of a
                        Frenchman.
                        The young musicians who founded the paper had formed themselves also
                        into an alliance, which they called the Davidsbendlerschaft. The
                        idea of this alliance, which was derived from Davids war with the
                        Philistines, seemed to exist only in the mind of Schumann himself.
                        It gave him a chance to write under the name of different characters,
                        chief of whom were Florestan and Eusebius, between whom stood Master
                        Raro. In Florestan Schumann expressed the powerful, passionate side of
                        his nature, and in Eusebius the mild and dreamy side."

                        (\x22Night Song\x22). We are shown a man who, worn out by trying to solve the
                        riddle of the universe, seeks refuge in religion. Then he revolts
                        against ascetic ideas, and gives way madly to his passions. But he is
                        quickly sated and disgusted and, weary to death, he tries science, but
                        rejects it again, and succeeds in ridding himself of the uneasiness its
                        knowledge brings by laughter--the master of the universe--and the merry
                        dance, that dance of the universe where all the human sentiments enter
                        hand-in-hand--religious beliefs, unsatisfied desires, passions,
                        disgust, and joy. \x22Lift up your hearts on high, my brothers! Higher
                        still! And mind you dont forget your legs! I have canonised laughter.
                        You super-men, learn to laugh!\x22[175] And the dance dies away and is lost
                        in ethereal regions, and Zarathustra is lost to sight while dancing in
                        distant worlds. But if he has solved the riddle of the universe for
                        himself, he has not solved it for other men; and so, in contrast to the
                        confident knowledge which fills the music, we get the sad note of
                        interrogation at the end.

  communication_note: "The season of 1856-7, was passed uneventfully by Brahms, in composing,
                        teaching and occasional journeys. He may be said to have had four
                        homes, besides that of his parents in Hamburg. In Desseldorf, Hanover,
                        Gettingen and Bonn he had many friends and was always welcome.
                        Wolf never chose commonplace poems for his music--which is more than can
                        be said of Schubert or Schumann. He did not use anything written by
                        contemporary poets, although he was in sympathy with some of them, such
                        as Liliencron, who hoped very much to be translated into music by him.
                        But he could not do it; he could not use anything in the work of a great
                        poet unless he became so intimate with it that it seemed to be a part of
                        him."

  communication_note: "After these early performances of the Concerto, Johann returned
                        to Hamburg, to his composing and teaching. He, however, played the
                        Concerto in his native city on a distinguished occasion, when Joachim
                        was a soloist in Spohrs Gesang-Scene, Stockhausen in a magnificent
                        Aria, and then Johann, pale, blond, slight, but calm and self
                        controlled. The Concerto scored a considerable success at last, and
                        the young composer was content.
                        This sum seemed to Haydn a real fortune. He was able to leave the
                        Spanglers and take up a garret of his own. There was no stove in it
                        and winter was coming on; it was only partly light, even at midday,
                        but the youth was happy. For he had acquired a little worm-eaten
                        spinet, and he had added to his treasures the first six sonatas of
                        Emmanuel Bach.
                        The _Academie des Beaux-Arts_, where six chairs are reserved for the
                        musical section, could have played a very important part in the musical
                        organisation of France by the authority of its name, and by the many
                        prizes that it gives for composition and criticism, especially by the
                        _Prix de Rome_, which it awards every year. But it does not play its
                        part well, partly because of the antiquated statutes that govern it, by
                        which a handful of musicians are associated with a great number of
                        painters, sculptors, and architects, who are ignorant of music and mock
                        at the musicians, as they did in the time of Berlioz; and partly because
                        it is the custom of the Academy that the little group of musicians shall
                        be trained in a very conservative way. One of the names of these
                        musicians is justly celebrated--that of M. Saint-Saens; but there are
                        others whose fame is of poorer quality, and others still who have no
                        fame at all. And the whole forms a little group, which though it does
                        not put any actual obstacles in the way of the progress of art, yet does
                        not look upon it favourably, but remains rather apart in an indifferent
                        or even hostile spirit.
                        With a light heart, and with buoyant trust in the future, though
                        with little money for present necessities, Wagner and his companions
                        arrived in Paris in September, 1839. Before him lay, if he had but
                        known it, two years and a half of bitter hardship and privation;
                        but--\x22out of trials and tribulations are great spirits molded.\x22"

                        the responsibility of the individual. He called Beethoven \x22the greatest,
                        the only really great artist,\x22 because he upheld the idea of universal
                        brotherhood. His mind is so comprehensive that he has written books on
                        philosophy, on the theatre, on classical painting,[124] as well as
                        scientific essays,[125] volumes of verse, and even plays.[126]
                        I doubt if Wolf with his rough, sincere nature would have found much
                        consolation in this tardy homage if he could have foreseen it. He would
                        have said to his posthumous admirers: \x22You are hypocrites. It is not for
                        me that you raise those statues; it is for yourselves. It is that you
                        may make speeches, form committees, and delude yourselves and others
                        that you were my friends. Where were you when I had need of you? You let
                        me die. Do not play a comedy round my grave. Look rather around you, and
                        see if there are not other Wolfs who are struggling against your
                        hostility or your indifference. As for me, I have come safe to port.\x22
                        The musical progress of the children was quite remarkable. Marianne,
                        which was Nannerls real name, soon began to play very well indeed,
                        while little Wolfgang hardly had to be told anything in music, for
                        he seemed to know it already. The father would write Minuets for the
                        little girl to study; her tiny brother would learn them in half an
                        hour. Soon Wolfgang was able to compose his own Minuets. Several have
                        come down to us which he wrote when he was five years old; and they
                        are quite perfect in form and style."

  communication_note: "The new Conservatoire of Music was founded at St. Petersburg in 1862,
                        with Anton Rubinstein as director, and Tschaikowsky lost no time in
                        entering as a pupil, studying composition and kindred subjects with
                        Professor Zaremba. His progress was so rapid in the several branches
                        he took up--piano, organ and flute--that Rubinstein advised him to
                        make music his profession, and throw his law studies to the winds.
                        Thanks to Rubinstein, he secured some pupils and also engagements as
                        accompanist. Meanwhile he worked industriously at composition, and one
                        of his pieces was a Concert Overture in F, scored for small orchestra.
                        In 1865 he took his diploma as a musician and also secured a silver
                        medal for a cantata. One year after this the Moscow Conservatoire
                        was founded, with Nicholas Rubinstein at its head. The position
                        of Professor of Composition and Musical History was offered to
                        Tschaikowsky, then only twenty-six. It was a flattering offer for so
                        young a man, when many older heads would have liked to secure such
                        an honor. He moved to Moscow, and retained his position in the
                        Conservatoire for at least twelve years, in the meantime making many
                        friends for himself and his art, as his fame as a composer grew. One
                        of these friends was the publisher Jurgenson, who was to play rather
                        an important part in the composers life, through accepting and
                        putting forth his compositions."

  communication_note: "Pasdeloup took up the work. After having been conductor for the _Societe
                        des jeunes artistes du Conservatoire_ since 1851, in the Salle Herz, he
                        founded, in 1861, at the Cirque dHiver, with the financial support of a
                        rich moneylender, the first _Concerts populaires de musique classique_.
                        Unhappily, says M. Saint-Saens, Pasdeloup, even up to 1870, made an
                        almost exclusive selection of German classical works. He raised an
                        impenetrable barrier before the young French school, and the only French
                        works he played were symphonies by Gounod and Gouvy, and the overtures
                        of _Les Francs-Juges_ and _La Muette_. It was impossible to set up a
                        rival society against him; and an exclusive monopoly in music was,
                        therefore, held by him. According to M. Saint-Saens he was a mediocre
                        musician, and had, in spite of his passion for music, \x22immense
                        incapacity.\x22 In _Harmonie et Melodie_ M. Saint-Saens says: \x22The few
                        chamber-music societies that existed were also closed to all new-comers;
                        their programmes only contained the names of undisputed celebrities, the
                        writers of classic symphonies. In those times one had really to be
                        devoid of all common sense to write music.\x22
                        It had long been Wagners desire to have a theater built, in which his
                        creations could be properly given under his direction. Bayreuth had
                        been chosen, as a quiet spot where music lovers could come for the
                        sole purpose of hearing the music. He went to live there with
                        his family in April, 1872. Two years later they moved into Villa
                        Wahnfried, which had been built according to the composers ideas.
                        Meanwhile funds were being raised on both sides of the water, through
                        the Wagner Societies, to erect the Festival Theater. The corner stone
                        was laid on Wagners birthday--his fifty-ninth--May 22, 1872. It was
                        planned to give the first performances in the summer of 1876; by that
                        time Wagners longed-for project became a reality."

  communication_note: "Wolfgang, not content with merely learning the piano, begged to study
                        the violin also. His violin lessons had hardly begun when one evening
                        his father and two friends were about to play a set of six trios,
                        composed by Wentzl, one of the players. Wolfgang begged to be allowed
                        to play the second violin. Needless to say his request was refused.
                        At last he was told he might sit next to Schachtner and make believe
                        play, though he must make no sound.
                        [Footnote 231: There are actually nine courses of Composition at the
                        _Schola_--five for men and four for women. M. dIndy takes eight of
                        them, as well as a mixed class for orchestra.]
                        It is not by any means the oldest and most celebrated musical
                        institutions which have taken the largest share in this evolution of
                        music in the last thirty years.

                        but the monarch could not wait and ordered \x22Das Rheingold,\x22 the
                        Introduction to the Trilogy, to be prepared. It was poorly given
                        and was not a success. Not at all discouraged, he wished for \x22Die
                        Walkere,\x22 which was performed the following year, June 26, 1870."

  communication_note: "[Footnote 79: It is amusing to find Wagner comparing Berlioz with Auber,
                        as the type of a true French musician--Auber and his mixed Italian and
                        German opera. That shows how Wagner, like most Germans, was incapable of
                        grasping the real originality of French music, and how he saw only its
                        externals. The best way to find out the musical characteristics of a
                        nation is to study its folk-songs. If only someone would devote himself
                        to the study of French folk-song (and there is no lack of material),
                        people would realise perhaps how much it differs from German folk-song,
                        and how the temperament of the French race shows itself there as being
                        sweeter and freer, more vigorous and more expressive.]
                        The King placed a pretty villa on Lake Starnberg, near Munich, at
                        Wagners disposal, and there he spent the summer of 1864. The Kings
                        summer palace was quite near, and monarch and composer were much
                        together. In the autumn a residence in the quiet part of Munich
                        was set apart for Wagner. Hans von Below was sent for as one of the
                        conductors; young Hans Richter lived in Munich and later became one of
                        the most distinguished conductors of Wagners music."

  communication_note: "George enjoyed himself hugely at the castle. The musicians were very
                        kind to him, and his delight could hardly be restrained when he was
                        allowed to try the beautiful organ in the chapel. The organist stood
                        behind him and arranged the stops, and the child put his fingers on
                        the keys that made the big pipes speak. During his stay, George had
                        several chances to play; one was on a Sunday at the close of the
                        service. The organist lifted him upon the bench and bade him play.
                        Instead of the Duke and all his people leaving the chapel, they stayed
                        to listen. When the music ceased the Duke asked: \x22Who is that child?
                        Does anybody know his name?\x22 The organist was sent for, and then
                        little George was brought. The Duke patted him on the head, praised
                        his playing and said he was sure to become a good musician. The
                        organist then remarked he had heard the father disapproved of his
                        musical studies. The Duke was greatly astonished. He sent for the
                        father and after speaking highly of the boys talent, said that
                        to place any obstacle in the childs way would be unworthy of the
                        fathers honorable profession.
                        Next to Mr. Toscanini hes the worlds most temperamental conductor,
                        but he has the ability to keep himself in check--when he wants to.
                        \x22Koussevitzky,\x22 says Ernest Newman, the eminent English music critic,
                        \x22has a volcanic temperament, yet never have I known it to run away
                        with him. It is precisely when his temperament is at the boiling point
                        that his hand on the regulator is steadiest.\x22
                        The whole work is to be preceded by a grand prelude, very carefully
                        worked out, to which Don Perosi attaches particular worth. He wishes, he
                        says, that his building shall have a beautiful door elaborately carved
                        after the fashion of the artists of the Renaissance and Gothic times.
                        And so he means to compose the prelude after the rest of the oratorio is
                        finished, when he is able to think about it in undisturbed peace. He
                        wishes to concentrate a moral atmosphere in it, the very essence of the
                        soul and passions of his sacred drama. He also confided to me that of
                        all he has yet composed there is nothing he likes better than the
                        introductions to _The Transfiguration_ and _The Resurrection of Christ_.
                        Nothing could have better completed the musical education of the public
                        than this continuous defile, for the past ten years, of _Kapellmeister_
                        and foreign virtuosi, and the comparisons that their different styles
                        and interpretations afforded. Nothing has better helped forward the
                        improvement of Parisian orchestras than the emulation brought about by
                        the meetings between Parisian conductors and those of other countries.
                        At present our own conductors are worthy rivals of the best in Germany.
                        The string instruments are good; the wood has kept its old French
                        superiority; and though the brass is still the weakest part of our
                        orchestras, it has made great progress. One may still criticise the
                        grouping of orchestras at concerts, for it is often defective; there is
                        a disproportion between the different families of instruments and, in
                        consequence, between their different sonorities, some of which are too
                        thin and others too dull. But these defects are fairly common all over
                        Europe to-day. Unhappily, more peculiar to France is the insufficiency
                        or poor quality of the choirs, whose progress has been far from keeping
                        pace with that of the orchestras. It is to this side of music that the
                        directors of concerts must now bring their efforts to bear."

                        school-master and a clergyman. He has a long, clean-shaven face, a

                        him when he started out with his father for Oldenburg. He was to play
                        a Concerto by Reis, and a Fantaisie of his own, accompanied by the
                        orchestra. In this his first public attempt Franz proved he possessed

                        him on this occasion were so delighted, that Adam then and there made
                        arrangements to give a second concert on his own account, which was

  communication_note: "[Footnote 94: These words are taken from Berliozs directions on the
                        score of his arrangement of the _Marseillaise_ for full orchestra and
                        double choir.] Not only did he fill his scenes in the theatre with
                        swarming and riotous crowds, like those of the Roman Carnival in the
                        second act of _Benvenuto_ (anticipating by thirty years the crowds of
                        _Die Meistersinger_), but he created a music of the masses and a
                        colossal style. His model here was Beethoven; Beethoven of the Eroica,
                        of the C minor, of the A, and, above all, of the Ninth Symphony. He was
                        Beethovens follower in this as well as other things, and the apostle
                        who carried on his work.[95] And with his understanding of material
                        effects and sonorous matter, he built edifices, as he says, that were
                        \x22Babylonian and Ninevitish,\x22[96] \x22music after Michelangelo,\x22[97] \x22on an
                        immense scale.\x22[98]
                        The long-expected event took place in August, 1876. The Festival
                        opened on the thirteenth with \x22Das Rheingold,\x22 first of the Ring music
                        dramas. On the following night \x22Die Walkere\x22 was heard; then came
                        \x22Siegfried\x22 and \x22Getterdemmerung,\x22 the third and fourth dramas being
                        heard for the first time. Thus the Ring of the Nibelungen, on which
                        the composer had labored for a quarter of a century at last found
                        a hearing, listened to by Kings and Potentates, besides a most
                        distinguished audience of musicians from all parts of the world."

  communication_note: "One may see by this short account what a heterogeneous work it is. Two
                        or three quite different worlds are brought into it: the realism of the
                        bourgeois characters of Vitas mother and lover is mixed up with
                        symbolisms of Christianity, represented by the Stranger, and with the
                        fairy-tale of the magic emerald and the voices of the ocean. This
                        complexity, which is evident enough in the poem, is even more evident in
                        the music, where a union of different arts and different ideas is
                        attempted. We get the art of the folk-song, religious art, the art of
                        Wagner, the art of Franck, as well as a note of familiar realism (which
                        is something akin to the Italian _opera-bouffe_) and descriptions of
                        sensation that are quite personal. As there are only two short acts, the
                        rapidity of the action only serves to accentuate this impression. The
                        changes are very abrupt: we are hurried from a world of human beings to
                        a world of abstract ideas, and then taken from an atmosphere of religion
                        to a land of fairies. The work is, however, clear enough from a musical
                        point of view. The more complex the elements that M. dIndy gathers
                        round him the more anxious he is to bring them into harmony. It is a
                        difficult task, and is only possible when the different elements are
                        reduced to their simplest expression and brought down to their
                        fundamental qualities--thus depriving them of the spice of their
                        individuality. M. dIndy puts different styles and ideas on the anvil,
                        and then forges them vigorously. It is natural that here and there we
                        should see the mark of the hammer, the imprint of his determination; but
                        it is only by his determination that he welded the work into a solid
                        whole.
                        From a scenic point of view, _Pelleas et Melisande_ is also quite
                        opposed to the Bayreuth ideal. The vast proportions--almost immoderate
                        proportions--of the Wagnerian drama, its compact structure and the
                        intense concentration of mind which from beginning to end holds these
                        enormous works and their ideology together, and which is often displayed
                        at the expense of the action and even the emotions, are as far removed
                        as they can be from the French love of clear, logical, and temperate

                        sharply cut, each marking without stress a new stage in the evolution of
                        the drama, are built up in quite a different way from those of the
                        Wagnerian theatre.

                        vogue; they were made by unreflecting minds, or by lovers of routine for
                        other lovers of routine. New needs of the mind, of the heart, and of the
                        sense of hearing, make necessary new endeavours and, in some cases, the
                        breaking of ancient laws. Many forms have become too hackneyed to be
                        still adopted. The same thing may be entirely good or entirely bad,

                        use of it. Sound and sonority are secondary to thought, and thought is
                        secondary to feeling and passion.\x22 (These opinions were given with
                        reference to Wagners concerts in Paris, in 1860, and are taken from _A

                        secluded in his drawing room, perhaps asleep, but more likely trying
                        to digest three helpings of creamed oysters in which he had indulged
                        at the home of an effusive Harrisburg hostess. Mr. Stokowski in those
                        days couldnt let creamed oysters alone, but neither could he take
                        them."

                        strenuously objected to the arrangement whereby the engineers in the
                        control room had the last word as to the volume of sound that was to
                        go out on the air.
                        In the _Fourth Symphony in G major_, the last part alone is sung, and is
                        of an almost humorous character, being a sort of childish description of
                        the joys of Paradise.
                        Weber was buried in London. His last wish--to return home,--was
                        finally fulfilled. Eighteen years after, his remains were brought to
                        Dresden, and the composer was at last at home.
                        When he tried to get a passport for Paris, he found it impossible
                        because of his debts. Not to be turned from his purpose, he, Minna and
                        the great Newfoundland dog, his pet companion, all slipped away from
                        Riga at night and in disguise. At the port of Pillau the trio embarked
                        on a sailing vessel for Paris, the object of all his hopes. The
                        young composer carried with him one opera and half of a second
                        work--\x22Rienzi,\x22 which he had written during the years of struggle in
                        Magdeburg and Kenigsberg. In Riga he had come upon Heines version
                        of the Flying Dutchman legend, and the sea voyage served to make the
                        story more vital."

                        1774. The opera proved an enormous success. The beautiful Queen
                        herself gave the signal for applause in which the whole house joined.
                        The charming Sophie Arnould sang the part of Iphigenie and seemed
                        to quite satisfy the composer. Larrivee was the Agamemnon, and other
                        parts were well sung. The French were thoroughly delighted. They
                        feted and praised Gluck, declaring he had discovered the music of the
                        ancient Greeks, that he was the only man in Europe who could express
                        real feelings in music. Marie Antoinette wrote to her sister: \x22We had,
                        on the nineteenth, the first performance of Glucks Iphigenie, and
                        it was a glorious triumph. I was quite enchanted, and nothing else is
                        talked of. All the world wishes to see the piece, and Gluck seems well
                        satisfied.\x22

                        about other peoples opinions; he says what he wants to say; and the
                        only thing that he troubles about is to say it as well as he possibly
                        can\x22 (Quoted by Hippeau).]"

                        occurred. Gade expressed a willingness to look at some of his
                        compositions, and asked if he had anything to show him. Edward
                        modestly answered in the negative. \x22Go home and write a symphony,\x22 was
                        the retort. This the young composer started obediently to do, but the
                        work was never finished in this form. It became later Two Symphonic
                        Pieces for Piano, Op. 14.
                        From this time on, one important composition followed another, until
                        increasing illness forshadowed the sad catastrophe of the early part
                        of 1854. He wrote in June 1851, \x22we are all tolerably well, except
                        that I am the victim of occasional nervous attacks; a few days ago I
                        fainted after hearing Radecke play the organ.\x22 These nervous attacks
                        increased in 1852. He could not think music in rapid tempo and wished
                        everything slow. He heard special tones to the exclusion of all
                        others.

  communication_note: "It is not my intention here to write an appreciation of Cesar Francks
                        genius, but it is not possible to understand the musical movement in
                        Paris of the last fifteen years if one does not take into account the
                        importance of his teaching. The organ class at the Conservatoire, where
                        in 1872 Franck succeeded his old master Benoist, was for a long time, as
                        M. Vincent dIndy says, \x22the true centre for the study of Composition
                        at the Conservatoire. Many of his fellow-workers could never bring
                        themselves to look upon him as one of themselves, because he had the
                        boldness to see in art something other than the means of earning a
                        living. Indeed, Cesar Franck was not of them; and they made him feel
                        this.\x22 But the young students made no mistake about the matter. \x22At this
                        time,\x22 M. dIndy also tells us,[222] \x22that is to say from 1872 to 1876,
                        the three courses of Advanced Musical Composition were given by three
                        professors who were not at all fitted for their work. One was Victor
                        Masse, a composer of simple light operas and a man with no understanding
                        of a symphony, who was very frequently ill and had to entrust his
                        teaching to one of his pupils; another was Henri Reber, an oldish
                        musician with narrow and dogmatic ideas; and the third was Francois
                        Bazin, who was not capable of distinguishing in his pupils fugues a
                        false answer from a true one, and whose highest title to glory is
                        derived from a composition called _Le Voyage en Chine_. So it is not
                        surprising that Cesar Francks teaching, founded on that of Bach and
                        Beethoven, but admitting, as well, imagination and all new and liberal
                        ideas, did, at that time, draw to him all young minds that had lofty
                        ambitions and that were really in love with their art. And so, quite
                        unconsciously, the master attracted to himself all the sincere and
                        artistic talent that was scattered about the different classes of the
                        Conservatoire, as well as that of his outside pupils.\x22
                        While waiting a few seconds for listeners and players to settle
                        themselves he rests his baton against his right shoulder, like a
                        sword. Then the sharp rap. The Maestro closes his eyes. Another rap,
                        sharper than the first. Oppressive, electrical silence. He lifts the
                        baton as if saluting the orchestra. The concert begins.
                        Now I come to Berliozs great originality, an originality which is
                        rarely spoken of, though it makes him more than a great musician, more
                        than the successor of Beethoven, or, as some call him, the forerunner of
                        Wagner. It is an originality that entitles him to be known, even more
                        fitly than Wagner himself, as the creator of \x22an art of the future,\x22 the
                        apostle of a new music, which even to-day has hardly made itself felt.
                        [Footnote 95: \x22From Beethoven,\x22 says Berlioz, \x22dates the advent in art
                        of colossal forms\x22 (_Memoires_, II, 112). But Berlioz forgot one of
                        Beethovens models--Haendel. One must also take into account the
                        musicians of the French revolution: Mehul, Gossec, Cherubini, and
                        Lesueur, whose works, though they may not equal their intentions, are
                        not without grandeur, and often disclose the intuition of a new and
                        noble and popular art.]"

                        \x22Tristan\x22 and \x22Parsifal\x22 had suggested themselves, and the plan of
                        the first was already sketched. He wrote to Liszt: \x22As I have never in
                        life felt the bliss of real love, I must erect a monument to the most
                        beautiful of all my dreams.\x22 The first act of \x22Tristan and Isolde\x22
                        was finished on the last day of the year 1857. In his retreat in
                        Switzerland, the composer longed for sympathetic, intellectual
                        companionship, which, alas, Minna could not give him. He found it in
                        the society of Marie Wesendonck, wife of the kind friend and music
                        lover, who had aided him in many ways. This marked attention to
                        another aroused Minnas jealousy and an open break was imminent. The
                        storm, however, blew over for a time.
                        [Footnote 164: Act III, scene 3. The power of that evocation is so
                        strong that it carries the poet along with it. It would seem that part
                        of the action had only been conceived with a view to the final effect of
                        the sudden colouring of the waves.]"

                        prevented his going anywhere else. For a malady, which finally proved
                        fatal, seemed to attack the composer when in his prime, and eventually
                        put an end to his work. We cannot guess what other art works he might

  communication_note: "Arrived in Vienna, that rich, gay, laughter-loving city, where the
                        people loved music and often did much for it, the youths musical
                        talent together with his forlorn appearance and condition won sympathy
                        from a few generous souls, who not only provided a home and took care
                        of his material needs, but gave him also the means to continue his
                        musical studies. Christoph was overcome with gratitude and made the
                        best possible use of his opportunities. For nearly two years he gave
                        himself up to his musical studies.
                        About this time a distant relative, one Johann Mathias Frankh by name,
                        arrived at the Haydn cottage on a visit. He was a schoolmaster at
                        Hainburg, a little town four leagues away. During the regular evening
                        concert he took particular notice of Josef and his toy violin. The
                        childs sweet voice indicated that he had the makings of a good
                        musician. At last he said: \x22If you will let me take Sepperl, I will
                        see he is properly taught; I can see he promises well.\x22
                        In 1827, Chopin finished his studies at the Lyceum and determined
                        to adopt music as his profession. He was now seventeen, of slender
                        figure, finely cut features, high forehead, delicate brows above
                        dreamy, soulful eyes. Though not weak or sickly, as some accounts make
                        out, he was never very robust; he would far rather lie under beautiful
                        trees in delightful day dreams, than take long excursions afoot. One
                        of his aversions was smoking or tobacco in any form; he never used it
                        in his whole life. He was vivacious, active, hard working at music and
                        reasonably healthy in early youth, but not of a hardy organism. His
                        mother and sisters constantly cautioned him to wrap up in cold or damp
                        weather, and like an obedient son and good brother, he obeyed."

  communication_note: "The late summer of 1850 brought Schumann an appointment of director of
                        music in Desseldorf, left vacant by the departure of Ferdinand Hiller
                        for Cologne. Schumann and his wife went to Desseldorf the first week
                        of September and were received with open arms. A banquet and concert
                        were arranged, at which some of the composers important works were
                        performed. His duties in the new post were conducting the subscription
                        concerts, weekly rehearsals of the Choral Club and other musical
                        performances. He seemed well content with the situation and it did not
                        require too much of his physical strength.
                        Nothing could have better completed the musical education of the public
                        than this continuous defile, for the past ten years, of _Kapellmeister_
                        and foreign virtuosi, and the comparisons that their different styles
                        and interpretations afforded. Nothing has better helped forward the
                        improvement of Parisian orchestras than the emulation brought about by
                        the meetings between Parisian conductors and those of other countries.
                        At present our own conductors are worthy rivals of the best in Germany.
                        The string instruments are good; the wood has kept its old French
                        superiority; and though the brass is still the weakest part of our
                        orchestras, it has made great progress. One may still criticise the
                        grouping of orchestras at concerts, for it is often defective; there is
                        a disproportion between the different families of instruments and, in
                        consequence, between their different sonorities, some of which are too
                        thin and others too dull. But these defects are fairly common all over
                        Europe to-day. Unhappily, more peculiar to France is the insufficiency
                        or poor quality of the choirs, whose progress has been far from keeping
                        pace with that of the orchestras. It is to this side of music that the
                        directors of concerts must now bring their efforts to bear."

                        but he was engaged for a term of years. The other half of the year
                        was spent in Hamburg, where he resumed his activities of composing and
                        teaching. The summer after his first winter in Detmold was spent
                        in Gettingen with warm friends. Clara Schumann was there with her
                        children, and Johann was always one of the family--as a son to her.
                        He was a famous playfellow for the children, too. About this time
                        he wrote a book of charming Childrens Folk Songs, dedicated to the
                        children of Robert and Clara Schumann. Johann was occupied with his
                        Piano Concerto in D minor. His method of working was somewhat like
                        Beethovens, as he put down his ideas in notebooks. Later on he formed
                        the habit of keeping several compositions going at once."

                        At last the tide turned slightly. A few pupils attracted by the small
                        fee he charged, took lessons on the clavier; he got a few engagements
                        to play violin at balls and parties, while some budding composers got
                        him to revise their manuscripts for a small fee. All these cheering
                        signs of better times made Josef hopeful and grateful. One day a
                        special piece of good fortune came his way. A man who loved music,
                        at whose house he had sometimes played, sent him a hundred and fifty
                        florins, to be repaid without interest whenever convenient.
                        Beethoven loved nature as much or more than any musician ever did. How
                        he hailed the spring because he knew the time would soon come when he
                        could close the door of his lodgings in the hot city, and slip away to
                        some quiet spot and hold sweet communion with nature. A forest was a
                        paradise, where he could ramble among the trees and dream. Or he
                        would select a tree where a forking branch would form a seat near the
                        ground. He would climb up and sit in it for hours, lost in thought.
                        Leaning against the trunk of a lime tree, his eyes fixed upon the
                        network of leaves and branches above him, he sketched the plan of his
                        oratorio \x22The Mount of Olives\x22; also that of his one opera \x22Fidelio,\x22
                        and the third Symphony, known as the \x22Eroica.\x22 He wrote to a friend,
                        \x22No man loves the country more than I. Woods, trees and rocks give the
                        response which man requires. Every tree seems to say Holy, holy.\x22"

                        party were obliged to climb a barricade, helped over by the

                        Gabriel Faure, Henri Duparc, Theodore Dubois, and Taffanel, joined
                        forces with them, and at a meeting on 25 February, 1871, agreed to found
                        a musical society that should give hearings to the works of living
                        French composers exclusively. The first meetings were interrupted by the
                        doings of the Commune; but they began again in October, 1871. The
                        Societys early statutes were drawn up by Alexis de Castillon, a
                        military officer and a talented composer, who, after having served in

                        of the founders of French chamber-music, and died prematurely in 1873,
                        aged thirty-five. It was these statutes, signed by Saint-Saens,
                        Castillon, and Garcin, that gave the Society its title of _Societe
                        Nationale de Musique_, and its device, \x22_Ars gallica_.\x22 This is what the

                        Giuseppe Verdi who was to produce such streams of beautiful,
                        sparkling music,--needing an Act of Parliament to stop them, as once
                        happened,--was a very quiet, thoughtful little fellow, always good and
                        obedient; sometimes almost sad, and seldom joined in the boisterous
                        games of other children. That serious expression found in all of
                        Verdis portraits as a man was even noticeable in the child. The only
                        time he would rouse up, was when a hand organ would come through the
                        village street; then he would follow it as far as his little legs
                        would carry him, and nothing could keep him in the house, when he
                        heard this music. Intelligent, reserved and quiet, every one loved
                        him.
                        At that time the composer was not ready to change his mind. He could
                        not live longer in the house filled with so many sad memories, but
                        moved to a new residence near the Corsia di Servi. One evening on
                        the street, he ran against Merelli, who was hurrying to the theater.
                        Without stopping he linked his arm in that of the composer and made
                        him keep pace. The manager was in the depths of woe. He had secured
                        a libretto by Solera, which was \x22wonderful, marvelous, extraordinary,
                        grand,\x22 but the composer he had engaged did not like it. What was to
                        be done? Verdi bethought him of the libretto \x22Proscritto,\x22 which Rossi
                        had once written for him, and he had not used. He suggested this
                        to Merelli. Rossi was at once sent for and produced a copy of the
                        libretto. Then Merelli laid the other manuscript before Verdi. \x22Look,
                        here is Soleras libretto; such a beautiful subject! Take it home and

                        It was evening and father Liszt, after the labors of the day were
                        over, could call these precious hours his own. He was now at the old
                        piano, for with him music was a passion. He used all his leisure time
                        for study and had some knowledge of most instruments. He had taught
                        himself the piano, indeed under the circumstances had become quite
                        proficient on it. To-night he was playing something of Haydn, for he
                        greatly venerated that master. Adam Liszt made a striking figure as
                        he sat there, his fine head, with its mass of light hair, thrown back,
                        his stern features softened by the music he was making."

                        During the last twelve years he has made, with untiring energy, a tour
                        of all the Ecoles Normales in France, returning several times to places
                        where he found signs of good vocal ability. In each school he made the
                        pupils sing his songs--in unison, or in two or three parts, sometimes
                        massing the boys and girls schools of one town together. His ambition
                        grew with his success; and to the folk-song melodies[245] he began
                        gradually to add pieces of classical music. And to impress the music
                        better on the singers he changed the existing words, and tried to find
                        others, which by their moral and poetic beauty more exactly translated
                        the musical feeling.[246]
                        Richard Nordraak was a young Norwegian composer of great talent, who,
                        in his brief career, created a few excellent works. The two musicians
                        met in the winter of 1864 and were attracted to each other at once.
                        Nordraak visited Grieg in his home, where they discussed music and
                        patriotism to their hearts content. Nordraak was intensely patriotic,
                        and wished to see the establishment of Norse music. Grieg, who had
                        been more or less influenced by German ideas, since Leipsic days,
                        now cast off the fetters and placed himself on the side of Norwegian
                        music. To prove this he composed the Humoresken, Op. 6, and dedicated
                        them to Nordraak. From now on he felt free to do as he pleased in
                        music--to be himself."

                        propaganda by means of concerts and publications is very active. From

                        been a school for public taste. One does not look for perfect execution

                        fuller knowledge of the great works of the past. They have revived
                        Monteverdes _Orfeo_ and his _Incoronazione di Poppea_, which had been
                        forgotten these three centuries; and it was following an interest

                        _Dardanus_ was performed at Dijon under M. dIndys direction, _Castor
                        et Pollux_ at Montpellier under M. Charles Bordes direction, and that
                        in 1908 the Opera at Paris gave _Hippolyte et Aricie_. Branches of the
                        _Schola_ have, been started at Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Avignon,
                        Montpellier, Nancy, Epinal, Montlucon, Saint-Chamond, and
                        Saint-Jean-deLuz.[234] A publishing house has been associated with the
                        School at Paris; and from this we get Reviews, such as the _Tribune de
                        Saint-Gervais_; publications of old music, such as the _Anthologie des

                        Charles Bordes; the _Archives des maitres de lorgue des XVIe, XVIIe, et
                        XVIIIe siecles_, edited by Alexandre Guilmant and Andre Pirro; the
                        _Concerts spirituels de la Schola_, the new editions of _Orfeo_, and the
                        _Incoronazione di Poppea_, edited by M. Vincent dIndy; and publications
                        of modern music, such as the _Collection du chant populaire_, the
                        _Repertoire moderne de musique vocale et dorgue_, and, notably, the
                        _Edition mutuelle_, published by the composers themselves, whose
                        property it is.
                        Soon the skies clouded; one hope after another failed. His

                        theaters failed on which he depended for assistance. He became in
                        great distress and could not pay for the furniture of the apartment,
                        which he had bought on credit. It was now that he turned to writing
                        for musical journals, to keep the wolf from the door, meanwhile
                        working on the score of \x22Rienzi,\x22 which was finished in November, 1840
                        and sent to Dresden. In later years it was produced in that city."

                        unexpected, the most subtle, and wedded it to sounds which invariably
                        expressed the full meaning. He breathed the breath of life into these
                        vague, shadowy poems, just as he made Maeterlincks \x22Pelleas\x22 live
                        again.

                        his three sisters-in-law, of all of whom he was very fond. In the
                        various scenes of the Butterflies there are allusions to persons and
                        places known to the composer; the whimsical spirit of Jean Paul broods
                        over the whole.
                        When he was fifteen Sebastian left his brothers roof and entered the
                        Latin school connected with the Church of St. Michael at L�neburg. It
                        was found he had a beautiful soprano voice, which placed him with the
                        scholars who were chosen to sing in the church service in return for
                        a free education. There were two church schools in Leneburg, and the
                        rivalry between them was so keen, that when the scholars sang in the
                        streets during the winter months to collect money for their support,
                        the routes for each had to be carefully marked out, to prevent
                        collision.

                        When I speak of passionate expression, I mean an expression that
                        desperately strives to reproduce the inward feeling of its subject, even
                        when the theme is contrary to passion, and deals with gentle emotions or
                        the deepest calm. It is this kind of expression that may be found in
                        _LEnfance du Christ_, and, above all, in the scene of _Le Ciel_ in the
                        _Damnation de Faust_ and in the _Sanctus_ of the _Requiem_\x22 (_Memoires_,

                        interested all the Hungarian aristocracy of the city. It was given
                        in the spacious drawing-rooms of the Princes palace, and a notable
                        audience was present. Little Franz achieved a triumph that night,
                        because of the fire and originality of his playing. Elegant women
                        showered caresses upon the child and the men were unanimous that such
                        gifts deserved to be cultivated to the utmost without delay."

  communication_note: "M. dIndy is not a man hedged in by the boundaries of his art; his mind
                        is open and well fertilised. Musicians nowadays are no longer entirely
                        absorbed in their notes, but let their minds go out to other interests.
                        And it is not one of the least interesting phenomena of French music
                        to-day that gives us these learned and thoughtful composers, who are
                        conscious of what they create, and bring to their art a keen critical
                        faculty, like that of M. Saint-Saens, M. Dukas, or M. dIndy. From M.
                        dIndy we have had scholarly editions of Rameau, Destouches, and Salomon
                        de Rossi. Even in the middle of rehearsals of _LEtranger_ at Brussels
                        he was working at a reconstruction of Monteverdes _Orfeo_. He has
                        published selections of folk-songs with critical notes, essays on
                        Beethovens predecessors, a history of Musical Composition, and debates
                        and lectures. This fine intellectual culture is not, however, the most
                        remarkable of M. dIndys characteristics, though it may have been the
                        most remarked. Other musicians share this culture with him; and his real
                        distinction lies in his moral and almost religious qualities, and it is
                        this side of him that gives him an unusual interest for us among other
                        contemporary artists.
                        The \x22Four Serious Songs,\x22 were published in the summer of 1896. At
                        this time Brahms had been settled in his rooms at Ischl scarcely a
                        fortnight when he was profoundly shaken by news of Clara Schumanns
                        death. She passed peacefully away in Frankfort, and was laid beside
                        her husband, in Bonn, May 24. Brahms was present, together with many
                        musicians and celebrities.
                        M. dIndy claims that this system may be applied as successfully to
                        instrumentalists and singers as to future composers. \x22For it is as
                        profitable for them to know,\x22 he says, \x22how to sing a liturgic monody
                        properly, or to be able to play a Corelli sonata in a suitable style, as
                        it is for composers to study the structure of a motet or a suite.\x22 M.
                        dIndy, moreover, obliged all students, without distinction, to attend
                        the lectures on vocal music; and, besides that, he instituted a special
                        class to teach the conducting of orchestras--which was something quite
                        new to France. His object, as he clearly said, was to give a new form to
                        modern music by means of a knowledge of the music of the past."

  communication_note: "The first argument, maintained by Wagner, is that music cannot really
                        express action without the help of speech and gesture. It is in the name
                        of this opinion that so many people condemn _a priori_ Berliozs
                        _Romeo_. They think it childish to try and _translate_ action into
                        music. I suppose they think it less childish to _illustrate_ an action
                        by music. Do they think that gesture associates itself very happily with
                        music? If only they would try to root up this great fiction, which has
                        bothered us for the last three centuries; if only they would open their
                        eyes and see--what great men like Rousseau and Tolstoy saw so
                        clearly--the silliness of opera; if only they would see the anomalies of
                        the Bayreuth show. In the second act of _Tristan_ there is a celebrated
                        passage, where Ysolde, burning with desire, is waiting for Tristan; she
                        sees him come at last, and from afar she waves her scarf to the
                        accompaniment of a phrase repeated several times by the orchestra. I
                        cannot express the effect produced on me by that _imitation_ (for it is
                        nothing else) of a series of sounds by a series of gestures; I can never
                        see it without indignation or without laughing. The curious thing is
                        that when one hears this passage at a concert, one sees the gesture. At
                        the theatre either one does not \x22see\x22 it, or it appears childish. The
                        natural action becomes stiff when clad in musical armour, and the
                        absurdity of trying to make the two agree is forced upon one. In the
                        music of _Rheingold_ one pictures the stature and gait of the giants,
                        and one sees the lightning gleam and the rainbow reflected on the
                        clouds. In the theatre it is like a game of marionettes; and one feels
                        the impassable gulf between music and gesture. Music is a world apart.
                        When music wishes to depict the drama, it is not real action which is
                        reflected in it, it is the ideal action transfigured by the spirit, and
                        perceptible only to the inner vision. The worst foolishness is to
                        present two visions--one for the eyes and one for the spirit. Nearly
                        always they kill each other.
                        Not long after this the boys father passed away, and as there was but
                        little money left for the mother, her son decided at once that he must
                        support himself and not deprive her of her small income. He acted as
                        deputy organist at the Cathedral and Castle of Halle, and a few years
                        later, when the post was vacant, secured it at a salary of less
                        than forty dollars a year and free lodging. George Frederick was now
                        seventeen and longed for a broader field. Knowing that he must leave
                        Halle to find it, he said good-by to his mother, and in January 1703,
                        set out for Hamburg to seek his fortune.
                        The people of Dublin warmly welcomed Handel, and the new oratorio,
                        the \x22Messiah,\x22 was performed at Music Hall, with choirs of both
                        cathedrals, and with some concertos on the organ played by the
                        composer. The performance took place, April 13, 1742. Four hundred
                        pounds were realized, which were given to charity. The success was so
                        great that a second performance was announced. Ladies were requested
                        to come without crinoline, thereby providing a hundred more seats than
                        at the first event."

  communication_note: "When the boys reached Paris, in 1822, Hector loyally tried to keep his
                        promise to his father and threw himself into the studies which were
                        so repugnant to him. He says he might have become a common-place
                        physician after all, had he not one night gone to the opera. That
                        night was a revelation; he became half frantic with excitement and
                        enthusiasm. He went again and again. Learning that the Conservatoire
                        library, with its wealth of scores, was open to the public, he began
                        to study the scores of his adored Gluck. He read, re-read and copied
                        long parts and scenes from these wonderful scores, even forgetting
                        to eat, drink or sleep, in his wild enthusiasm. Of course, now, the
                        career of doctor must be given up; there was no question of that. He
                        wrote home that in spite of father, mother, relations and friends, a
                        musician he would be and nothing else.
                        The same year, in the Eden theatre, to which the concerts had been
                        transferred, Lamoureux conducted, for the first time in Paris, the first
                        act of the _Walkuere_. In these concerts the tenor, Van Dyck, made his
                        _debut_; later, he was one of the leading performers at Bayreuth. In
                        1886-1887 Lamoureux rehearsed and conducted the only performance of
                        _Lohengrin_ at the Eden theatre. Disturbances in the streets prevented
                        further performances. Lamoureux then established himself in the
                        concert-room of the Cirque des Champs Elysees, where for eleven years he
                        has given what are called the _Concerts-Lamoureux_. He continued to
                        spread the knowledge of Wagners works, and has sometimes had the help
                        of some of the most celebrated of the Bayreuth artists, among others,
                        that of Mme. Materna and Lilli Lehmann. At the end of the season of 1897
                        Lamoureux wished to disband his orchestra in order to conduct concerts
                        abroad. But the members of the orchestra decided to remain together
                        under the name of the _Association des Concerts-Lamoureux_, with
                        Lamoureuxs son-in-law, M. Camille Chevillard, as conductor. But
                        Lamoureux was not long before he returned to the conductorship of the
                        concerts, which had now returned to the Chateau-dEau theatre; and a few
                        months before his death, in 1899, he conducted the first performance of
                        _Tristan_ at the Nouveau theatre. And so he had the happiness of being
                        present at the complete triumph of the cause for which he had fought so
                        stubbornly for nearly twenty years.[220]

                        never had great power, for a heavy wagon had injured one of his hands,
                        and he had lost the use of one of his lungs in youth. But he always
                        brought out lyric parts most expressively, and had a \x22wonderfully
                        crisp and buoyant execution in rhythmical passages.\x22 He continued to
                        play occasionally in different cities, and with increased frequency
                        made visits to England, France and Germany, to make known his
                        compositions. He was in England in the spring of 1888, for on May
                        3, the London Philharmonic gave almost an entire program of Griegs
                        music. He acted in the three-fold capacity of composer, conductor and
                        pianist. It was said by one of the critics: \x22Mr. Grieg played his
                        own Concerto in A minor, after his own manner; it was a revelation.\x22
                        Another wrote; \x22The Concerto is very beautiful. The dreamy charm of
                        the opening movement, the long-drawn sweetness of the Adagio, the
                        graceful, fairy music of the final Allegro--all this went straight
                        to the hearts of the audience. Grieg as a conductor gave equal
                        satisfaction. It is to be hoped the greatest representative of old
                        Norway will come amongst us every year.\x22
                        \x22The unsolvable enigma of the world, the existence of evil and
                        pain, the fierce madness of mankind, and the stupid cruelty that it
                        inflicts hourly and everywhere on the most inoffensive beings and
                        on itself--all this has reduced me to the state of unhappy and
                        forlorn resignation of a scorpion surrounded by live coals. The
                        most I can do is not to wound myself with my own dart.\x22[42]
                        \x22There is no need for you to trouble yourself or fear that I shall
                        overdo things. A real distaste for work has taken possession of me,
                        and I believe I shall never write another note. My unfinished opera
                        has no more interest for me, and music altogether is hateful. You
                        see what my kind friends have done for me! I cannot think how I
                        shall be able to exist in this state.... Ah, happy Swabians! one
                        may well envy you. Greet your beautiful country for me, and be
                        warmly greeted yourself by your unhappy and worn-out friend, Hugo
                        Wolf.\x22"

                        Poor Josef! He realized that his place was virtually taken by the
                        brother he had welcomed so joyously only a short time before. No one
                        was to blame of course; it was one of those things that could not be
                        avoided. But what actually caused him to leave St. Stephens was a
                        boyish prank played on one of the choir boys, who sat in front of
                        him. Taking up a new pair of shears lying near, he snipped off, in a
                        mischievous moment, the boys pigtail. For this jest he was punished
                        and then dismissed from the school. He could hardly realize it, in his
                        first dazed, angry condition. Not to enjoy the busy life any more, not
                        to see Michael and the others and have a comfortable home and sing
                        in the Cathedral. How he lived after that he hardly knew. But several
                        miserable days went by. One rainy night a young man whom he had known
                        before, came upon him near the Cathedral, and was struck by his
                        white, pinched face. He asked where the boy was living. \x22Nowhere--I am
                        starving,\x22 was the reply. Honest Franz Spangler was touched at once."

                        In music he learned a great deal from his friend Schalk,[184] a
                        professor at the Vienna Conservatoire; but, like Berlioz, he got most of
                        his education from the libraries, and spent months in reading the scores
                        of the great masters. Not having a piano, he used to carry Beethovens
                        sonatas to the Prater Park in Vienna and study them on a bench in the
                        open air. He soaked himself in the classics--in Bach and Beethoven, and
                        the German masters of the _Lied_--Schubert and Schumann. He was one of
                        the young Germans who was passionately fond of Berlioz; and it is due to
                        Wolf that France was afterwards honoured in the possession of this great
                        artist, whom French critics, whether of the school of Meyerbeer, Wagner,
                        Franck, or Debussy, have never understood. He was also early a friend of
                        old Anton Bruckner, whose music we do not know in France, neither his
                        eight symphonies, nor his _Te Deum_, nor his masses, nor his cantatas,
                        nor anything else of his fertile work. Bruckner had a sweet and modest
                        character, and an endearing, if rather childish, personality. He was
                        rather crushed all his life by the Brahms party; but, like Franck in
                        France, he gathered round him new and original talent to fight the
                        academic art of his time."

                        splendid was the first inspiration of the work that the years have not
                        dimmed its brilliancy. One would like to end with _Siegfried_, and
                        escape the gloomy _Goetterdaemmerung_. For those who have sensitive
                        feelings the fourth day of the Tetralogy has a depressing effect. I
                        remember the tears I have seen shed at the end of the _Ring_, and the
                        words of a friend, as we left the theatre at Bayreuth and descended the
                        hill at night: \x22I feel as though I were coming away from the burial of
                        someone I dearly loved.\x22 It was truly a time of mourning. Perhaps there
                        was something incongruous in building such a structure when it had
                        universal death for its conclusion--or at least in making the whole an
                        object of show and instruction. _Tristan_ achieves the same end with
                        much more power, as the action is swifter. Besides that, the end of
                        _Tristan_ is not without comfort, for life there is terrible. But it is
                        not the same in _Goetterdaemmerung_; for in spite of the absurdity of the
                        spell which is set upon the love of Siegfried and Bruennhilde, life with
                        them is happy and desirable, since they are beings capable of love, and
                        death appears to be a splendid but awful catastrophe. And one cannot say
                        the _Ring_ breathes a spirit of renunciation and sacrifice like
                        _Parsifal_; renunciation and sacrifice are only talked about in the
                        _Ring_; and, in spite of the last transports which impel Bruennhilde to
                        the funeral pyre, they are neither an inspiration nor a delight. One has
                        the impression of a great gulf yawning at ones feet, and the anguish of
                        seeing those one loves fall into it."

                        fantastique_ has been recently identified by M. Julien Tiersot, in his
                        interesting book,[14] with a romance composed by Berlioz at the age of
                        twelve, when he loved a girl of eighteen \x22with large eyes and pink
                        shoes\x22--Estelle, _Stella mentis, Stella matutina_. These words--perhaps
                        the saddest he ever wrote--might serve as an emblem of his life, a life
                        that was a prey to love and melancholy, doomed to wringing of the heart
                        and awful loneliness; a life lived in a hollow world, among worries that
                        chilled the blood; a life that was distasteful and had no solace to
                        offer him in its end.[15] He has himself described this terrible \x22_mal
                        de lisolement_,\x22 which pursued him all his life, vividly and
                        minutely.[16] He was doomed to suffering, or, what was worse, to make
                        others suffer.
                        But his frequent brushes with news photographers dont come under this
                        head. The existence of numerous fine camera studies of the Maestro
                        proves that he doesnt dislike being photographed. Nor does he dislike
                        photographers. But he hates flashlights because they hurt his eyes.
                        It is said that Chopin met Mme. Sand at a musical matinee, given by
                        the Marquis of C, where the aristocracy of genius, wealth and beauty
                        had assembled. Chopin had gone to the piano and was absorbed in an
                        improvisation, when lifting his eyes from the keys he encountered the
                        fiery glances of a lady standing near. Perhaps the truer account of
                        their first meeting is that given by Chopins pupil Gutman. Mme. Sand,
                        who had the faculty of subjugating every man of genius she came in
                        contact with, asked Liszt repeatedly to introduce her."

                        published a detailed study of his works in his _Oper und Drama_ in 1851,
                        wrote to Liszt in 1855: \x22I own that it would interest me very much to
                        make the acquaintance of Berliozs symphonies, and I should like to see
                        the scores. If you have them, will you lend them to me?\x22]
                        For distraction he went to Italy; Turin, Genoa, Spezia, and Nice. But
                        there, in a strange world, his loneliness seemed so frightful that he
                        became very depressed, and made all haste back to Zurich. It was there
                        he wrote the happy music of _Das Rheingold_. He began the score of _Die
                        Walkuere_ at a time when his normal condition was one of suffering. Then
                        he discovered Schopenhauer, whose philosophy only helped to confirm and
                        crystallise his instinctive pessimism. In the spring of 1855 he went to
                        London to give concerts; but he was ill there, and this fresh contact
                        with the world only served to annoy him further. He had some difficulty
                        in again taking up _Die Walkuere_; but he finished it at last in spite of
                        frequent attacks of facial erysipelas, for which he afterwards had to
                        undergo a hydropathic cure at Geneva. He began the score of _Siegfried_
                        towards the end of 1856, while the thought of Tristan was stirring
                        within him. In _Tristan_ he wished to depict love as \x22a dreadful
                        anguish\x22; and this idea obsessed him so completely that he could not
                        finish _Siegfried_. He seemed to be consumed by a burning fever; and,
                        abandoning _Siegfried_ in the middle of the second act, he threw himself
                        madly into _Tristan_. \x22I want to gratify my desire for love,\x22 he says,
                        \x22until it is completely satiated; and in the folds of the black flag
                        that floats over its consummation I wish to wrap myself and die.\x22[109]
                        _Siegfried_ was not finished until 5 February, 1871, at the end of the
                        Franco-Prussian war--that is fourteen years later, after several
                        interruptions."

                        abortive and gloomy breed; the spirit of wild laughter that dances like
                        a tempest as gaily on marshes and sadness as it does in fields.\x22[176]
                        That spirit laughs at itself and at its idealism in the _Don Quixote_ of
                        1897, _fantastische Variationen uber ein Thema ritterlichen Charakters_
                        (\x22Don Quixote, fantastic variations on a theme of knightly character\x22),
                        op. 35; and that symphony marks, I think, the extreme point to which
                        programme music may be carried. In no other work does Strauss give
                        better proof of his prodigious cleverness, intelligence, and wit; and I
                        say sincerely that there is not a work where so much force is expended
                        with so great a loss for the sake of a game and a musical joke which
                        lasts forty-five minutes, and has given the author, the executants, and
                        the public a good deal of tiring work. These symphonic poems are most
                        difficult to play on account of the complexity, the independence, and
                        the fantastic caprices of the different parts. Judge for yourself what
                        the author expects to get out of the music by these few extracts from
                        the programme:--"

                        On June 18, 1821, came the first performance of Webers masterpiece,
                        \x22Der Freischetz.\x22 The theater was beseiged for hours by eager crowds,
                        and when the doors were at last opened, there was a grand rush to
                        enter. The whole house from pit to galleries was soon filled, and
                        when the composer entered the orchestra, there was a roar of applause,
                        which it seemed would never end. As the performance proceeded, the
                        listeners became more charmed and carried away, and at the close there
                        was a wild scene of excitement. The success had been tremendous, and
                        the frequent repetitions demanded soon filled the treasury of the
                        theater. Everybody was happy, the composer most of all. The melodies
                        were played on every piano in Germany and whistled by every street
                        urchin. Its fame spread like lightning over Europe, and quickly
                        reached England. In London the whole atmosphere seemed to vibrate with
                        its melodies. In Paris, however, it did not please on first hearing,
                        perhaps because it was so thoroughly German. But somewhat later, when
                        renamed \x22Robin des Bois,\x22--\x22Robin of the Forest,\x22--it was performed
                        some three hundred and fifty times before being withdrawn."

                        boy was at the most impressionable age: he was lively, witty, with
                        pleasant manners and amiable disposition; he soon became a favorite in
                        the highest musical circles. It was a gay life and the inexperienced
                        youth yielded to its allurements. In the meantime he did some serious
                        studying under the famous Abbe Vogler. The following year the Abbe
                        recommended him to the conductorship of the Breslau Opera House. This
                        was a very difficult post for a boy of eighteen, and he encountered
                        much jealousy and opposition from the older musicians, who did not
                        relish finding themselves under the leadership of such a youth. A year
                        served to disgust him with the work and he resigned. During the year

  communication_note: "\x22Classical music was so little known to the musical public that
                        even the audiences of _La Trompette_, cultured as they were, did
                        not at all understand Beethovens last quartettes; and my friends
                        jeered at my taste for enigmas. This only made me the more
                        determined that they should hear one of these great works at each
                        concert. And sometimes I would give the same work at two or three
                        concerts running if I thought it had not been properly appreciated.
                        In that case I used to say before the performance: It seems to me
                        that such-and-such a work has not been quite understood at the last
                        hearing; and as it is a really marvellous work, I am sure that your
                        feeling is that you do not know it sufficiently. So I have included
                        it in to-days programme.\x22[237]
                        At the time when I was feeling Wagners seductiveness so strongly there
                        were always some carping people among my elders ready to quench my
                        admiration and say with a superior smile: \x22That is nothing. One cant
                        judge Wagner at a concert. You must hear him in the opera-house at
                        Bayreuth.\x22 Since then I have been several times to Bayreuth; I have seen
                        Wagners works performed in Berlin, in Dresden, in Munich, and in other
                        German towns, but I have never again felt the old intoxication. People
                        are wrong to pretend that closer acquaintance with a fine work adds to
                        ones enjoyment of it. It may throw light upon it, but it nips ones
                        imagination and dispels the mystery. The puzzling fragments one hears at
                        concerts will take on splendid proportions on account of all the mind
                        adds to them. That epic poem of the _Niebelungen_ was once like a forest
                        in our dreams, where strange and awful beings flashed before our vision
                        and then vanished. Later on, when we had explored all its paths, we
                        discovered that order and reason reigned in the midst of this apparent
                        jungle; and when we came to know the least wrinkle on the faces of its
                        inhabitants, the confusion and emotion of other days no longer filled
                        us.
                        Remark also Berliozs freedom of melody. His musical phrases pulse and
                        flow like life itself. \x22Some phrases taken separately,\x22 says Schumann,
                        \x22have such an intensity that they will not bear harmonising--_as in many
                        ancient folk-songs_--and often even an accompaniment spoils their
                        fulness.\x22[89] These melodies so correspond with the emotions, that they
                        reproduce the least thrills of body and mind by their vigorous
                        workings-up and delicate reliefs, by splendid barbarities of modulation
                        and strong and glowing colour, by gentle gradations of light and shade
                        or imperceptible ripples of thought, which flow over the body like a
                        steady tide. It is an art of peculiar sensitiveness, more delicately
                        expressive than that of Wagner; not satisfying itself with the modern
                        tonality, but going back to old modes--a rebel, as M. Saint-Saens
                        remarks, to the polyphony which had governed music since Bachs day, and
                        which is perhaps, after all, \x22a heresy destined to disappear.\x22[90]
                        But it is especially in Strausss subjects that caprice and a disordered
                        imagination, the enemy of all reason, seem to reign. We have seen that
                        these poems try to express in turn, or even simultaneously, literary
                        texts, pictures, anecdotes, philosophical ideas, and the personal
                        sentiments of the composer. What unity is there in the adventures of Don
                        Quixote or Till Eulenspiegel? And yet unity is there, not in the
                        subjects, but in the mind that deals with them. And these descriptive
                        symphonies with their very diffuse literary life are vindicated by their
                        musical life, which is much more logical and concentrated. The caprices

                        disports himself \x22after the old form of rondeau,\x22 and the folly of Don
                        Quixote is told in \x22ten variations on a chivalrous theme, with an
                        introduction and finale.\x22 In this way, Strausss art, one of the most
                        literary and descriptive in existence, is strongly distinguished from
                        others of the same kind by the solidarity of its musical fabric, in
                        which one feels the true musician--a musician brought up on the great
                        masters, and a classic in spite of everything."

  communication_note: "Neefe was ordered to proceed with the Elector and Court to Menster,
                        which meant to leave his organ in Bonn for a time. Before starting
                        he called Ludwig to him and told him of his intended absence. \x22I must
                        have an assistant to take my place at the organ here. Whom do you
                        think I should appoint?\x22 Seeing the boy had no inkling of his meaning,
                        he continued: \x22I have thought of an assistant, one I am sure I can
                        trust,--and that is you, Ludwig.\x22
                        The achievement of an artistic ideal so restricted as this would not
                        have sufficed, however, to assure the success of the _Schola Cantorum_,
                        nor establish its authority with a public that was, whatever people may
                        say, only lukewarm in its religion, and that would only interest itself
                        in the religious art of other days as it would in a passing fashion. But
                        the spirit of curiosity and the meaning of modern life began to weigh
                        little by little with the Scholas principles. After singing
                        Palestrinian and Gregorian chants at the Church of Saint-Gervais during
                        Holy Week, they played Carissimi, Schuetz, and the Italian and German
                        masters of the seventeenth century. Then came Bachs cantatas; and their
                        performance, given by M. Bordes in the Salle dHarcourt, attracted large
                        audiences and started the cult of this master in Paris. Then they sang
                        Rameau and Gluck; and, finally, all ancient music, sacred or secular,
                        was approved. And so this little school, which had been consecrated to
                        the cult of ancient religious music, and had made so modest a
                        beginning,[229] developed into a School of Art capable of satisfying
                        modern wants; and in 1900, when M. Vincent dIndy became president of
                        the _Schola_, it was decided to move the school into larger premises in
                        the Rue Saint-Jacques.
                        He has also excellent discernment, of an unemotional kind; and he is
                        \x22calm in spirit, restrained in imagination, and keeps his self-control
                        even in the midst of the most disturbing emotions.\x22[119] This
                        discernment is the enemy of anything approaching obscurity of thought or
                        mysticism; and its outcome was that curious book, _Problemes et
                        Mysteres_--a misleading title, for the spirit of reason reigns there and
                        makes an appeal to young people to protect \x22the light of a menaced
                        world\x22 against \x22the mists of the North, Scandinavian gods, Indian
                        divinities, Catholic miracles, Lourdes, spiritualism, occultism, and
                        obscurantism.\x22[120]
                        After all, why be astonished that his mighty mission was too much for
                        him? He was so alone.[107] As people forsook him, his loneliness stood
                        out in greater relief. He was alone in the age of Wagner, Liszt,
                        Schumann, and Franck; alone, yet containing a whole world in himself, of
                        which his enemies, his friends, his admirers, and he himself, were not
                        quite conscious; alone, and tortured by his loneliness. Alone--the word
                        is repeated by the music of his youth and his old age, by the _Symphonie
                        fantastique_ and _Les Troyens_. It is the word I read in the portrait
                        before me as I write these lines--the beautiful portrait of the
                        _Memoires_, where his face looks out in sad and stern reproach on the
                        age that so misunderstood him."

  communication_note: "At last this sort of dumb frenzy spent itself and the musician in him
                        awoke and he returned to his normal self. A new plan began to take
                        shape in his mind. He would give a concert of his own works: up to
                        that time no French musician had done so. Thus he would compel her
                        to hear of him, although he had not yet met the object of his devoted
                        admiration.
                        [Footnote 81: \x22Music to-day, in the vigour of her youth, is emancipated
                        and free and can do what she pleases. Many old rules have no longer any
                        vogue; they were made by unreflecting minds, or by lovers of routine for
                        other lovers of routine. New needs of the mind, of the heart, and of the
                        sense of hearing, make necessary new endeavours and, in some cases, the
                        breaking of ancient laws. Many forms have become too hackneyed to be
                        still adopted. The same thing may be entirely good or entirely bad,
                        according to the use one makes of it, or the reasons one has for making
                        use of it. Sound and sonority are secondary to thought, and thought is
                        secondary to feeling and passion.\x22 (These opinions were given with
                        reference to Wagners concerts in Paris, in 1860, and are taken from _A
                        travers chants_, p. 312.)
                        In the autumn of this year, Johann paid his third visit to Detmold,
                        and found himself socially as well as musically the fashion. It was
                        the correct thing to have lessons from him and his presence gave
                        distinction to any assemblage. But Johann did not wish to waste his
                        time at social functions; when obliged to be present at some of these
                        events he would remain silent the entire evening, or else say sharp
                        or biting things, making the hosts regret they had asked him. His
                        relations with the Court family, however, remained very pleasant.
                        Yet he began to chafe under the constant demands on his time, and the
                        rigid etiquette of the little Court. The next season he definitely
                        declined the invitation to revisit Detmold, the reason given was that
                        he had not the time, as he was supervising the publication of a number
                        of his works. Brahms had become interested in writing for the voice,
                        and had already composed any number of beautiful vocal solos and part
                        songs.
                        I shall not say much about the four first works, where the mind and
                        manner of the artist is taking shape. The _Wanderers Sturmlied_ (the
                        song of a traveller during a storm, op. 14) is a vocal sextette with an
                        orchestral accompaniment, whose subject is taken from a poem of
                        Goethes. It was written before Strauss met Ritter, and its construction
                        is after the manner of Brahms, and shows a rather affected thought and
                        style. _Aus Italien_ (op. 16) is an exuberant picture of impressions of
                        his tour in Italy, of the ruins at Rome, the seashore at Sorrento, and
                        the life of the Italian people. _Macbeth_ (op. 23) gives us a rather
                        undistinguished series of musical interpretations of poetical subjects.
                        _Don Juan_ (op. 20) is much finer, and translates Lenaus poem into
                        music with bombastic vigour, showing us the hero who dreams of grasping
                        all the joy of the world, and how he fails, and dies after he has lost
                        faith in everything."

  communication_note: "Ferdinand Hiller, composer, pianist and one of Hectors intimate
                        friends, fell deeply in love with Marie Moke, a beautiful, talented
                        girl who, later on, won considerable fame as a pianist. She became
                        interested in the young French composer, through hearing of his mental
                        suffering from Hiller. They were thrown together in a school where
                        both gave lessons, she on the piano and he on the--guitar! Meeting so
                        constantly, her dainty beauty won a warm place in the affections of
                        the impressionable Hector. She was but eighteen, while her admirer was
                        twenty-five.
                        And, as if he wished to accentuate this antagonism, the author of
                        _Pelleas et Melisande_ is now writing a _Tristan_, whose plot is taken
                        from an old French poem, the text of which has been recently brought to
                        light by M. Bedier. In its calm and lofty strain it is a wonderful
                        contrast to Wagners savage and pedantic, though sublime poem.
                        And thus a number of years slipped away amid these happy surroundings.
                        Little Josef was now a likely lad of about fifteen years. It was
                        arranged that his younger brother Michael was to come to the Cantorei.
                        Josef looked eagerly forward to this event, planning how he would help
                        the little one over the beginning and show him the pleasant things
                        that would happen to him in the new life. But the elder brother could
                        not foresee the sorrow and privation in store for him. From the moment
                        Michaels pure young voice filled the vast spaces of the cathedral, it
                        was plain that Josefs singing could not compete with it. His soprano
                        showed signs of breaking, and gradually the principal solo parts,
                        which had always fallen to him, were given to the new chorister. On
                        a special church day, when there was more elaborate music, the \x22Salve
                        Regina,\x22 which had always been given to Josef, was sung so beautifully
                        by the little brother, that the Emperor and Empress were delighted,
                        and they presented the young singer with twenty ducats."

                        able to do, without making a single error.
                        About the end of October, 1828, he began to show signs of a serious
                        breakdown. He was living at the home of his brother Ferdinand, in one
                        of the suburbs of the city. Although he revived a little during
                        the early part of November, so that he could resume walks in the
                        neighborhood, the weakness increased, and eleven days passed without
                        food or drink. Lingering till the nineteenth of November, he passed
                        peacefully away, still in his early manhood. The old father, the
                        schoolmaster at the old home, hoped to have his son buried in the
                        little cemetery near by. But Ferdinand knew his brothers wish, to be
                        placed near Beethoven in Wehringer Cemetery. The monument, erected by
                        his friends and admirers the following year, bears, above the name,
                        this inscription:
                        The Mendelssohn family originally lived in Hamburg. Their house faced
                        one of the fine squares of the city, with a handsome church on
                        the opposite side. The building is still there and well preserved,
                        although the principal story is used as public dining rooms. A large
                        tablet has been placed above the doorway, with a likeness of the
                        composer encircled by a wreath of laurel. Here little Felix was born,
                        February 3, 1809. There were other children, Fanny a year or two
                        older, then after Felix came Rebekka and little Paul. When French
                        soldiers occupied the town in 1811, life became very unpleasant for
                        the German residents, and whoever could, sought refuge in other cities
                        and towns. Among those who successfully made their escape was the
                        Mendelssohn-Bartholdy family, the second name belonged to the family
                        and was used to distinguish their own from other branches of the
                        Mendelssohn family. With his wife and children, Abraham Mendelssohn
                        fled to Berlin, and made his home for some years with the grandmother,
                        who had a house on the Neue Promenade, a fine broad street, with
                        houses only on one side, the opposite side descended in a grassy slope
                        to the canal, which flowed lazily by."

  communication_note: "Geyer found employment in a Dresden theater, so the family removed to
                        that city. But he did not live to see the blossoming of his youngest
                        step-sons genius, as he passed away on September 30, 1821, when the
                        child was eight years old.
                        \x22They assured me that they had a tremendous lot of machinery to
                        make all this movement, and they offered several times to show it
                        to me; but I felt no curiosity about little effects achieved by
                        great efforts.... The sky is represented by some blue rags
                        suspended from sticks and cords, like a laundry display.... The
                        chariots of the gods and goddesses are made of four joists in a
                        frame, suspended by a thick rope, as a swing might be. Then a plank
                        is stuck across the joists, and on this is seated a god. In front
                        of him hangs a piece of daubed cloth, which serves as a cloud upon
                        which his splendid chariot may rest.... The theatre is furnished
                        with little square trap-doors which, opening as occasion requires,
                        show that the demons can be let loose from the cellars. When the
                        demons have to fly in the air, dummies of brown cloth are
                        substituted, or sometimes real chimney-sweeps, who swing in the
                        air, suspended by cords, until they are gloriously lost in the rag
                        sky....
                        From the fact that the father had held government appointments, his
                        sons were eligible for education at the School of Jurisprudence. Peter
                        was accordingly entered there as a scholar, and completed his course
                        at the age of nineteen. In those nine years the child Peter developed
                        into maturity. During this period he suffered the loss of his mother,
                        a handsome and very estimable woman, whom he adored with passionate
                        devotion, and from whom he could never bear to be separated."

                        a year among them. For it was not till March 23, 1743, that the
                        \x22Messiah\x22 was performed in London. The King was one of the great
                        audience who heard it. All were so deeply impressed by the Hallelujah

                        to this it has always been the custom to stand during this chorus,

  communication_note: "In disposition Hannes was kindly and sincere; as a youth merry and
                        gay. A friend in Desseldorf, where he now spent four weeks, thus
                        describes him:
                        Chopins health now began to be a source of anxiety to his friends.
                        He had to be very careful, gave fewer lessons during the season, and
                        spent his vacations at Nohant. He played rarely in public, though
                        there were two public concerts in 1841 and 42 at Pleyels rooms. From
                        1843 to 1847 he lived quietly and his life was apparently happy. He
                        was fond of the Sand children, and amused himself with them when at
                        Nohant.
                        Handel came to London, preceded by the fame of his Italian success.
                        Italian opera was the vogue just then in the English capital, but
                        it was so badly produced that a man of Handels genius was needed to
                        properly set it before the people. He had not been long on English
                        soil when he produced his opera \x22Rinaldo,\x22 at the Queens Theater;
                        it had taken him just two weeks to compose the opera. It had great
                        success and ran night after night. There are many beautiful airs in
                        \x22Rinaldo,\x22 some of which we hear to-day with the deepest pleasure.
                        \x22Lascia chjo pianga\x22 and \x22Cara sis sposa\x22 are two of them. The
                        Londoners had welcomed Handel with great cordiality and with his
                        new opera he was firmly established in their regard. With the young
                        musician likewise there seemed to be a sincere affection for England.
                        He returned in due time to his duties in Hanover, but he felt that
                        London was the field for his future activities.
                        The same year, in the Eden theatre, to which the concerts had been
                        transferred, Lamoureux conducted, for the first time in Paris, the first
                        act of the _Walkuere_. In these concerts the tenor, Van Dyck, made his
                        _debut_; later, he was one of the leading performers at Bayreuth. In
                        1886-1887 Lamoureux rehearsed and conducted the only performance of
                        _Lohengrin_ at the Eden theatre. Disturbances in the streets prevented
                        further performances. Lamoureux then established himself in the
                        concert-room of the Cirque des Champs Elysees, where for eleven years he
                        has given what are called the _Concerts-Lamoureux_. He continued to
                        spread the knowledge of Wagners works, and has sometimes had the help
                        of some of the most celebrated of the Bayreuth artists, among others,
                        that of Mme. Materna and Lilli Lehmann. At the end of the season of 1897
                        Lamoureux wished to disband his orchestra in order to conduct concerts
                        abroad. But the members of the orchestra decided to remain together
                        under the name of the _Association des Concerts-Lamoureux_, with
                        Lamoureuxs son-in-law, M. Camille Chevillard, as conductor. But
                        Lamoureux was not long before he returned to the conductorship of the
                        concerts, which had now returned to the Chateau-dEau theatre; and a few
                        months before his death, in 1899, he conducted the first performance of
                        _Tristan_ at the Nouveau theatre. And so he had the happiness of being
                        present at the complete triumph of the cause for which he had fought so
                        stubbornly for nearly twenty years.[220]"

  communication_note: "More baneful even than the influence of the theatre is the influence of
                        success. These musicians have nowadays too many facilities for having
                        their music played. A work is played almost before it is finished, and
                        the musician has no time to live with his work in solitude and silence.
                        Besides this, the works of the chief German musicians are supported by
                        tremendous booming of some kind or another: by their _Musikfeste_, by
                        their critics, their press, and their \x22Musical Guides\x22 (_Musikfuehrer_),
                        which are apologetic explanations of their works, scattered abroad in
                        millions to set the fashion for the sheep-like public. And with all this
                        a musician grows soon contented with himself, and comes to believe any
                        favourable opinion about his work. What a difference from Beethoven,
                        who, all his life, was hammering out the same subjects, and putting his
                        melodies on the anvil twenty times before they reached their final form.
                        That is where Mahler is so lacking. His subjects are a rather vulgarised
                        edition of some of Beethovens ideas in their unfinished state. But
                        Mahler gets no further than the rough sketch."

  communication_note: "Wagner fled to Switzerland, leaving Minna still in Dresden, though in
                        due time he succeeded in scraping together funds for her to follow him
                        to Zurich. He was full of plans for composing \x22Siegfried,\x22 while she
                        continually urged him to write pleasing operas that Paris would
                        like. Wagner believed the world should take care of him while he was
                        composing his great works, whereas Minna saw this course meant living
                        on the charity of friends, and at this she rebelled. But Wagner grew
                        discouraged over these petty trials, and for five years creative work
                        was at a standstill.
                        About the end of October, 1828, he began to show signs of a serious
                        breakdown. He was living at the home of his brother Ferdinand, in one
                        of the suburbs of the city. Although he revived a little during
                        the early part of November, so that he could resume walks in the
                        neighborhood, the weakness increased, and eleven days passed without
                        food or drink. Lingering till the nineteenth of November, he passed
                        peacefully away, still in his early manhood. The old father, the
                        schoolmaster at the old home, hoped to have his son buried in the
                        little cemetery near by. But Ferdinand knew his brothers wish, to be
                        placed near Beethoven in Wehringer Cemetery. The monument, erected by
                        his friends and admirers the following year, bears, above the name,
                        this inscription:
                        But while admitting that _Tristan_ is a symphony that is not suitable
                        for representation, one also recognises its blemishes and, above all,
                        its unevenness. The orchestration in the first act is often rather thin,
                        and the plot lacks solidity. There are gaps and unaccountable holes, and
                        melodious lines left suspended in space. From beginning to end, lyrical
                        bursts of melody are broken by declamations, or, what is worse, by
                        dissertations. Frenzied whirlwinds of passion stop suddenly to give
                        place to recitatives of explanation or argument. And although these
                        recitatives are nearly always a great relief, although these
                        metaphysical reveries have a character of barbarous cunning that one
                        relishes, yet the superior beauty of the movements of pure poetry,
                        emotion, and music is so evident, that this musical and philosophical
                        drama serves to give one a distaste for philosophy and drama and
                        everything else that cramps and confines music."

                        The achievement of an artistic ideal so restricted as this would not
                        have sufficed, however, to assure the success of the _Schola Cantorum_,
                        nor establish its authority with a public that was, whatever people may
                        say, only lukewarm in its religion, and that would only interest itself
                        in the religious art of other days as it would in a passing fashion. But
                        the spirit of curiosity and the meaning of modern life began to weigh
                        little by little with the Scholas principles. After singing
                        Palestrinian and Gregorian chants at the Church of Saint-Gervais during
                        Holy Week, they played Carissimi, Schuetz, and the Italian and German
                        masters of the seventeenth century. Then came Bachs cantatas; and their
                        performance, given by M. Bordes in the Salle dHarcourt, attracted large
                        audiences and started the cult of this master in Paris. Then they sang
                        Rameau and Gluck; and, finally, all ancient music, sacred or secular,
                        was approved. And so this little school, which had been consecrated to
                        the cult of ancient religious music, and had made so modest a
                        beginning,[229] developed into a School of Art capable of satisfying
                        modern wants; and in 1900, when M. Vincent dIndy became president of
                        the _Schola_, it was decided to move the school into larger premises in
                        the Rue Saint-Jacques.
                        Let us make a little _resume_. Wolf at twenty-eight years old had
                        written practically nothing. From 1888 to 1890 he wrote, one after
                        another, in a kind of fever, fifty-three Moerike _Lieder_, fifty-one
                        Goethe _Lieder_, forty-four Spanish _Lieder_, seventeen Eichendorff
                        _Lieder_, a dozen Keller _Lieder_, and the first Italian _Lieder_--that
                        is about two hundred _Lieder_, each one having its own admirable
                        individuality.
                        At the time when his wifes health was causing him most anxiety, there
                        came to him one night an inspiration for a symphony. The first part of
                        it--an allegro in two-four time in A minor--was ringing in his head. He

                        All this is not much, and we are yet terribly behindhand, especially as
                        regards secondary teaching, which is considered less important than
                        primary teaching.[255] But we are scrambling out of an abyss of
                        ignorance, and it is something to have the desire to get out of it. We
                        must remember that Germany has not always been in its present plethoric
                        state of musical prosperity. The great choral societies only date from
                        the end of the eighteenth century. Germany in the time of Bach was
                        poor--if not poorer--in means for performing choral works than France
                        to-day. Bachs only executants were his pupils at the Thomasschule at
                        Leipzig, of which barely a score knew how to sing.[256] And now these
                        people gather together for the great _Maennergesangsfeste_ (choral
                        festivals) and the _Musikfeste_ (music festivals) of Imperial Germany.
                        Little Johannes, or Hannes as he was called, was surrounded from his
                        earliest years by a musical atmosphere, and must have shown a great
                        desire to study music. We learn that his father took him to Otto
                        Cossel, to arrange for piano lessons. Hannes was seven years old, pale
                        and delicate looking, fair, with blue eyes and a mass of flaxen hair.

  communication_subject: "This heaping-up of music both crude and learned in style, with harmonies that are sometimes clumsy and sometimes delicate, is worth considering on account of its bulk."
  communication_note: "It is perhaps fitting that the series of volumes comprising _The
                        Musicians Bookshelf_ should be inaugurated by the present collection of
                        essays. To the majority of English readers the name of that strange and
                        forceful personality, Romain Rolland, is known only through his
                        magnificent, intimate record of an artists life and aspirations,
                        embracing ten volumes, _Jean-Christophe_. This is not the place in which
                        to discuss that masterpiece. A few biographical facts concerning the
                        author may not, however, be out of place here.
                        Basili took the paper and examined it, showing signs of astonishment
                        as he continued to read. When he came to the conclusion he
                        complimented the lad and said: \x22But how is it that you have written a
                        double canon on my subject?\x22
                        Then came the Prix de Rome, which the poor boy had struggled so long
                        to win, and now did not care so much for, as going to Italy would mean
                        to leave Paris. On August 23, 1830, he wrote to a friend:
                        But what joy there is when these deeds of faith have been
                        performed--when Jesus has cured the possessed man, or when Lazarus has
                        opened his eyes to the light. The heart of the multitude overflows
                        perhaps in rather childish thanksgiving; and at first it seemed to me
                        expressed in a commonplace way. But did not the joy of all great artists
                        so express itself?--the joy of Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach, who, when
                        once they had thrown their cares aside, knew how to amuse themselves
                        like the rest of the populace. And the simple phrase at the beginning
                        soon assumes fuller proportions, the harmonies gain in richness, a
                        glowing ardour fills the music, and a chorale blends with the dances in
                        triumphant majesty."

                        weeks in Boulogne, because the great Meyerbeer was summering there.
                        Wagner met the influential composer and confided his hopes and
                        longings. Meyerbeer received the poor young German kindly, praised his
                        music, gave him several letters to musicians in power in Paris, but
                        told him persistence was the most important factor in success.
                        The Leipsic Conservatory, which had been founded by Mendelssohn, and
                        later directed for a short time by Schumann, was now in the hands of
                        Moscheles, distinguished pianist and conductor. Richter and Hauptmann,

                        the spirit of the great classics belonging to the end of the eighteenth
                        century--far more, whatever people may say, with the spirit of
                        Beethoven, Haydn, and Mozart, than with the spirit of Bach. Schumanns
                        seductiveness also left its mark upon him, and he has felt the influence

                        break down a wall of prejudice and pedantry, of convention and
                        intellectual snobbery. In short, one must shake off nearly all current
                        ideas about his work if one wishes to extricate it from the dust that
                        has drifted about it for half a century.
                        The pronounced musical talent of his boy was a source of pride to Adam

                        began to be called \x22the artist.\x22 The result was that when a concert
                        was to be given at the neighboring Oldenburg, Adam was requested to
                        allow his wonder child to play.
                        \x22At the close of the year 33, a number of musicians, mostly young,
                        met in Leipsic every evening, apparently by accident at first, but
                        really for the interchange of ideas on all musical subjects. One day
                        the young hot heads exclaimed: Why do we look idly on? Lets take
                        hold and make things better. Thus the new Journal for music began."

                        came into the possession of King George III, and are preserved in the
                        musical library of Buckingham Palace.
                        \x22So, you are _the_ Weber! I suppose you want me to buy your operas.
                        One fills an evening, the other doesnt. Very well, I will give
                        fifteen hundred florins for the two. Is it a bargain?\x22 Weber accepted,
                        and promised to return the next spring to conduct the operas. He kept
                        his promise, and the result was much better than he ever dreamed. For
                        beyond the performance of his operas, he was offered the post of music
                        director of the Prague theater, which post was just then vacant.
                        The salary was two thousand florins, with a benefit concert at a
                        guaranteed sum of one thousand more, and three months leave of absence
                        every year. This assured sum gave young Weber the chance of paying his
                        debts and starting afresh, which, he writes \x22was a delight to him.\x22
                        During those first years in Moscow, Tschaikowsky made his home with
                        Nicholas Rubinstein. His life was of the simplest, his fare always so.
                        Later on when money was more abundant, and he had his own house in the
                        country, he lived with just the same simplicity. One would think that
                        all this care and thought for expense would have taught him the value
                        of money. Not at all. He never could seem to learn its value, never
                        cared for it, and never could keep it. He liked to toss his small
                        change among groups of street boys, and it is said he once spent his
                        last roubles in sending a cablegram to von Below in America, to thank
                        him for his admirable performance of his first Piano Concerto. Often
                        his friends protested against this prodigality, but it was no use to
                        protest, and at last they gave up in despair."

                        of nineteenth-century music. His audacious power dominates all his age;

  communication_note: "The great composer was a big man, both physically and mentally. A
                        friend describes his countenance as full of fire; \x22when he smiled it
                        was like the sun bursting out of a black cloud. It was a sudden flash
                        of intelligence, wit and good humor, which illumined his countenance,
                        which I have hardly ever seen in any other.\x22 He could relish a joke,
                        and had a keen sense of humor. Few things outside his work interested
                        him; but he was fond of the theater, and liked to go to picture sales.
                        His fiery temper often led him to explode at trifles. No talking among
                        the listeners could be borne by him while he was conducting. He did
                        not hesitate to visit violent abuse on the heads of those who ventured
                        to speak while he was directing and not even the presence of royalty
                        could restrain his anger.
                        It was a happy household that retired that night. Nannerl was happy
                        because she at last had the chance to take piano lessons. Wolfgang,
                        little \x22Starbeam,\x22 dreamed of the wonderful Goddess of Music, who
                        carried him away to fairyland which was filled with beautiful music.
                        The parents were filled with joy that heaven had granted them such
                        blessings in their children.
                        Finally, this Gothic spirit shows itself--in a less original way, it is
                        true--in M. dIndys religious antipathies, which, in spite of the
                        authors goodness of heart and great personal tolerance, constantly
                        break out against the two faiths that are rivals to his own; and to them
                        he attributes all the faults of art and all the vices of humanity. Each
                        has its offence. Protestantism is made responsible for the extremes of
                        individualism;[146] and Judaism, for the absurdities of its customs and
                        the weakness of its moral sense.[147] I do not know which of the two is
                        the more soundly belaboured; the second has the privilege of being so,
                        not only in writing, but in pictures.[148] The worst of it is, these
                        antipathies are apt to spoil the fairness of M. dIndys artistic
                        judgment. It goes without saying that the Jewish musicians are treated
                        with scant consideration; and even the great Protestant musicians,
                        giants in their art, do not escape rebuke. If Goudimel is mentioned, it
                        is because he was Palestrinas master, and his achievement of \x22turning
                        the Calvinist psalms into chorales\x22 is dismissed as being of little
                        importance.[149]
                        Many of the composers whose life stories we have read were surrounded
                        by musical atmosphere from their earliest years; Robert Schumann seems
                        to have been an exception. His father, August Schumann, was the son
                        of a poor pastor, and the boy August was intended to be brought up a
                        merchant. At the age of fifteen he was put into a store in Nonneburg.
                        He was refined in his tastes, loved books, and tried even in boyhood
                        to write poetry. He seemed destined, however, to live the life marked
                        out for him, at least for a time. It grew so distasteful, that later
                        he gave it up and, on account of extreme poverty, returned to his
                        parents home, where he had the leisure to write. At last he secured
                        a position in a book store in Zeitz. In this little town he met the
                        daughter of his employer. The engagement was allowed on the condition
                        that he should leave the book store and set up his own business. But
                        where was the money to come from? He left the store, returned home
                        and in a year and a half had earned a thousand thalers, then quite a
                        handsome sum."

  communication_subject: "Berlioz then conceived the idea of going to Russia to retrieve his fortunes."
  communication_note: "Then, in 1890, there were signs of a movement that was in revolt against
                        its despotism. The great wind from the East began to drop, and veered to
                        the North. Scandinavian and Russian influences were making themselves
                        felt. An exaggerated infatuation for Grieg, though limited to a small
                        number of people, was an indication of the change in public taste. In
                        1890, Cesar Franck died in Paris. Belgian by birth and temperament, and
                        French in feeling and by musical education, he had remained outside the
                        Wagnerian movement in his own serene and fecund solitude. To his
                        intellectual greatness and the charm his personal genius held for the
                        little band of friends who knew and revered him he added the authority
                        of his knowledge. Unconsciously he brought back to us the soul of
                        Sebastian Bach, with its infinite richness and depth; and through this
                        he found himself the head of a school (without having wished it) and the
                        greatest teacher of contemporary French music. After his death, his
                        name was the means of rallying together the younger school of
                        musicians. In 1892, the _Chanteurs de Saint-Gervais_, under the
                        direction of M. Charles Bordes, reinstated to honour and popularised
                        Gregorian and Palestrinian music; and, following the initiative of their
                        director, the _Schola Cantorum_ was founded in 1894 for the revival of
                        religious music. Ambition grew with success; and from the _Schola_
                        sprang the _Ecole Superieure de Musique_, under the direction of
                        Francks most famous pupil, M. Vincent dIndy. This school, founded on a
                        solid knowledge, not only of the classics, but of the primitives in
                        music, took from its very beginning in 1900 a frankly national
                        character, and was in some ways opposed to German art. At the same time,
                        performances of Bach and seventeenth-and eighteenth-century music became
                        more and more frequent; and more intimate relationship with the artists
                        of other countries, repeated visits of the great _Kapellmeister_,
                        foreign virtuosi and composers (especially Richard Strauss), and,
                        lastly, of Russian composers, completed the education of the Parisian
                        musical public, who, after repeated rebukes from the critics, became
                        conscious of the awakening of a national personality, and of an
                        impatient desire to free itself from German tutelage. By turns it
                        gratefully and warmly received M. Bruneaus _Le Reve_ (1891), M.
                        dIndys _Fervaal_ (1898), M. Gustave Charpentiers _Louise_ (1900)--all
                        of which seemed like works of liberation. But, as a matter of fact,
                        these lyric dramas were by no means free from foreign influences, and
                        especially from Wagnerian influences. M. Debussys _Pelleas et
                        Melisande_, in 1902, seemed to mark more truly the emancipation of
                        French music. From this time on, French music felt that it had left
                        school, and claimed to have founded a new art, which reflected the
                        spirit of the race, and was freer and suppler than the Wagnerian art.
                        These ideas, which were seized upon and enlarged by the press, brought
                        about rather quickly a conviction in French artists of Frances
                        superiority in music. Is that conviction justified? The future alone can
                        tell us. But one may see by this brief outline of events how real is the
                        evolution of the musical spirit in France since 1870, in spite of the
                        apparent contradictions of fashion which appear on the surface of art.
                        It is the spirit of France that is, after long oppression and by a
                        patient but eager initiation, realising its power and wishing to
                        dominate in its turn.
                        The season of 1856-7, was passed uneventfully by Brahms, in composing,
                        teaching and occasional journeys. He may be said to have had four
                        homes, besides that of his parents in Hamburg. In Desseldorf, Hanover,
                        Gettingen and Bonn he had many friends and was always welcome.
                        In 1869, the Khedive of Egypt had a fine opera house built in Cairo,
                        and commissioned Verdi to write an opera having an Egyptian subject,
                        for the opening. The ever popular \x22Aida\x22 was then composed and brought
                        out in 1871, with great success. This proved to be the beginning of
                        the masters third period, for he turned from his earlier style which
                        was purely lyric, to one with far more richness of orchestration."

                        In 1827, Chopin finished his studies at the Lyceum and determined
                        to adopt music as his profession. He was now seventeen, of slender
                        figure, finely cut features, high forehead, delicate brows above
                        dreamy, soulful eyes. Though not weak or sickly, as some accounts make
                        out, he was never very robust; he would far rather lie under beautiful
                        trees in delightful day dreams, than take long excursions afoot. One
                        of his aversions was smoking or tobacco in any form; he never used it
                        in his whole life. He was vivacious, active, hard working at music and
                        reasonably healthy in early youth, but not of a hardy organism. His
                        mother and sisters constantly cautioned him to wrap up in cold or damp
                        weather, and like an obedient son and good brother, he obeyed.
                        It was 2 oclock in the morning, Mr. Stokowski, the conductor, was
                        secluded in his drawing room, perhaps asleep, but more likely trying
                        to digest three helpings of creamed oysters in which he had indulged
                        at the home of an effusive Harrisburg hostess. Mr. Stokowski in those
                        days couldnt let creamed oysters alone, but neither could he take
                        them.
                        The news of this startling feat gained for the young musician a
                        cordial welcome into the houses of the great in Rome; during their
                        stay father and son were feted to their hearts content."

                        exacting, his bearing towards other musicians has nothing of Mahlers
                        winning modesty. He is not less nervous than Mahler, and while he is
                        conducting the orchestra he seems to indulge in a frenzied dance which
                        follows the smallest details of his music--music that is as agitated as
                        limpid water into which a stone has been flung. But he has a great
                        advantage over Mahler; he knows how to rest after his labours. Both

                        counterbalanced by his indolence, and there is in the depths of him a
                        Bavarian love of luxury. I am quite sure that when his hours of intense
                        living are over, after he has spent an excessive amount of energy, he
                        has hours when he is only partially alive. One then sees his eyes with a
                        vague and sleepy look in them; and he is like old Rameau, who used to
                        walk about for hours as if he were an automaton, seeing nothing and
                        thinking of nothing."

  communication_note: "Soon after this Count Borromes engaged Verdi to write a Cantata for
                        chorus and orchestra, to honor the occasion of a marriage in the
                        family. Verdi did so but was never paid a sou for his work. The next
                        request was from Masini, who urged Verdi to compose an opera for
                        the Teatro Filodramatico, where he was conductor. He handed him a
                        libretto, which with a few alterations here and there became \x22Oberto,
                        Conte di San Bonifacio.\x22 Verdi accepted the offer at once, and being
                        obliged to move to Busseto, where he had been appointed organist,
                        remained there nearly three years, during which time the opera was
                        completed. On returning to Milan he found Masini no longer conductor,
                        and lost all hope of seeing the new opera produced. After long waiting
                        however, the impressario sent for him, and promised to bring out the
                        work the next season, if the composer would make a few changes. Young
                        and as yet unknown, Verdi was quite willing. \x22Oberto\x22 was produced
                        with a fair amount of success, and repeated several times. On the
                        strength of this propitious beginning, the impressario, Merelli, made
                        the young composer an excellent offer--to write three operas, one
                        every eight months, to be performed either in Milan or in Vienna,
                        where he was impressario of both the principal theaters. He promised
                        to pay four thousand lire--about six hundred and seventy dollars--for
                        each, and share the profits of the copyright. To young Verdi this
                        seemed an excellent chance and he accepted at once. Rossi wrote a
                        libretto, entitled \x22Proscritto,\x22 and work on the music was about to
                        begin. In the spring of 1840, Merelli hurried from Vienna, saying he
                        needed a comic opera for the autumn season, and wanted work begun on
                        it at once. He produced three librettos, none of them very good. Verdi
                        did not like them, but since there was no time to lose, chose the
                        least offensive and set to work."

  communication_note: "The introduction represents Don Quixote buried in books of chivalrous
                        romance; and we have to see in the music, as we do in little Flemish and
                        Dutch pictures, not only Don Quixotes features, but the words of the
                        books he reads. Sometimes it is the story of a knight who is righting a
                        giant, sometimes the adventures of a knight-errant who has dedicated
                        himself to the services of a lady, sometimes it is a nobleman who has
                        given his life in fulfilment of a vow to atone for his sins. Don
                        Quixotes mind becomes confused (and our own with it) over all these
                        stories; he is quite distracted. He leaves home in company with his
                        squire. The two figures are drawn with great spirit; the one is an old
                        Spaniard, stiff, languishing, distrustful, a bit of a poet, rather
                        undecided in his opinions but obstinate when his mind is once made up;
                        the other is a fat, jovial peasant, a cunning fellow, given to repeating
                        himself in a waggish way and quoting droll proverbs--translated in the
                        music by short-winded phrases that always return to the point they
                        started from. The adventures begin. Here are the windmills (trills from
                        the violins and wood wind), and the bleating army of the grand emperor,
                        Alifanfaron (tremolos from the wood wind); and here, in the third
                        variation, is a dialogue between the knight and his squire, from which
                        we are to guess that Sancho questions his master on the advantages of a
                        chivalrous life, for they seem to him doubtful. Don Quixote talks to him
                        of glory and honour; but Sancho has no thought for it. In reply to these
                        grand words he urges the superiority of sure profits, fat meals, and
                        sounding money. Then the adventures begin again. The two companions fly
                        through the air on wooden horses; and the illusion of this giddy voyage
                        is given by chromatic passages on the flutes, harps, kettledrums, and a
                        \x22windmachine,\x22 while \x22the tremolo of the double basses on the key-note
                        shows that the horses have never left the earth.\x22[177]
                        [Footnote 89: _Ibid_. \x22A rare peculiarity,\x22 adds Schumann, \x22which
                        distinguishes nearly all his melodies.\x22 Schumann understands why Berlioz
                        often gives as an accompaniment to his melodies a simple bass, or chords
                        of the augmented and diminished fifth--ignoring the intermediate parts.]
                        \x22Was this not geniality itself? No other great man I have met is like
                        him. I played the Funeral March, which was also to his taste. Then,
                        after a little talk, I took leave, with the consciousness of having
                        spent two of the most interesting hours of my life.\x22
                        Love for women was destined to play a large part in the inner life of
                        Chopin. The first awakening of this feeling came from his admiration
                        of Constantia Gladowska, a beautiful girl and vocal pupil at the
                        Conservatory at Warsaw. Strangely enough he admired the young lady for
                        some time at a distance, and if report be true, never really declared
                        himself to her. But she filled his thoughts by day, and he confessed
                        to dreaming of her each night. When she made her debut in opera, he
                        hung on every note she sang and rejoiced in her success but did not
                        make his feelings known to her. All this pent-up emotion was confined
                        to his piano, in impassioned improvisations."

                        called the Getreide Gasse, lights gleamed from windows on the third
                        floor. Within, all was arranged as if for some special occasion.
                        The larger room, with its three windows looking on the street, was
                        immaculate in its neatness. The brass candlesticks shone like gold,
                        the mahogany table was polished like a mirror, the simple furniture
                        likewise. For today was Father Mozarts birthday and the little
                        household was to celebrate the event.
                        It was open war against the metrical art of the last three centuries, in
                        the name of national tradition (more or less freely interpreted), of
                        folk-song, and of Gregorian chant. And \x22the constant and avowed purpose
                        of all this campaign was the triumph of French music, and its
                        cult.\x22[259]
                        The day fixed for the trial arrived; a brilliant company assembled.
                        Bach made his appearance, and all was ready, but the adversary failed
                        to come. After a considerable delay it was learned that Marchand had
                        fled the city."

                        [Footnote 246: I reserve my opinion, from an artists point of view, on
                        this plagiarising of the words of songs. On principle I condemn it
                        absolutely. But, in this case, it is Hobsons choice. _Primum vivere,
                        deinde philosophari_. If our contemporary musicians really wished the
                        people to sing, they would have written songs for them; but they seem to
                        have no desire to achieve honour that way. So there is nothing else to
                        be done but to have recourse to the musicians of other days; and even
                        there the choice is very limited. For France formerly, like the France
                        of to-day, had very few musicians who had any understanding of a great
                        popular art. Berlioz came nearest to understanding the meaning of it;
                        and he is not yet public property, so his airs cannot be used. It is
                        curious, and rather sad, that out of eighty pieces chosen by M. Buchor
                        only nine of them are French; and this is reckoning the Italians, Lully
                        and Cherubini, as Frenchmen. M. Buchor has had to go to German classical
                        musicians almost entirely, and, generally speaking, his choice has been
                        a happy one. With a sure instinct he has given the preference to popular
                        geniuses like Haendel and Beethoven. We may ask why he did not keep their
                        words; but we must remember that at any rate they had to be translated;
                        and though it may seem rash to change the subject of a musical
                        masterpiece, it is certain that M. Buchors clever adaptations have
                        resulted in driving the fine thoughts of Haendel and Schubert and Mozart
                        and Beethoven into the memories of the French people, and making them
                        part of their lives. Had they heard the same music at a concert they
                        would probably not have been very much moved. And that makes M. Buchor
                        in the right. Let the French people enrich themselves with the musical
                        treasures of Germany until the time comes when they are able to create a
                        music of their own! This is a kind of peaceful conquest to which our art
                        is accustomed. \x22Now then, Frenchmen,\x22 as Du Bellay used to say, \x22walk
                        boldly up to that fine old Roman city, and decorate (as you have done
                        more than once) your temples and altars with its spoils.\x22 Besides, let
                        us remember that the German masters of the eighteenth century, whose
                        words M. Buchor has plagiarised, did not hesitate to plagiarise
                        themselves; and in turning the Berceuse of the _Oratorio de Noel_ into a
                        _Sainte famille humaine_, M. Buchor has respected the musical ideas of
                        Bach much more than Bach himself did when he turned it into a _Dialogue
                        between Hercules and Pleasure_.]
                        But whatever may be the educational value of the theatre and concerts,
                        they are not complete enough in themselves for the people. To make their
                        influence deep and enduring it must be combined with teaching. Music, no
                        less than every other expression of thought, has no use for the
                        illiterate."

                        Bayreuth.\x22 Since then I have been several times to Bayreuth; I have seen
                        Wagners works performed in Berlin, in Dresden, in Munich, and in other
                        German towns, but I have never again felt the old intoxication. People
                        are wrong to pretend that closer acquaintance with a fine work adds to
                        ones enjoyment of it. It may throw light upon it, but it nips ones
                        imagination and dispels the mystery. The puzzling fragments one hears at
                        concerts will take on splendid proportions on account of all the mind
                        adds to them. That epic poem of the _Niebelungen_ was once like a forest
                        in our dreams, where strange and awful beings flashed before our vision
                        and then vanished. Later on, when we had explored all its paths, we
                        discovered that order and reason reigned in the midst of this apparent
                        jungle; and when we came to know the least wrinkle on the faces of its
                        inhabitants, the confusion and emotion of other days no longer filled
                        us.
                        One day in February 1854, his physician made a noon call upon him.
                        They sat chatting when suddenly Schumann left the room without a word.
                        The doctor and his friends supposed he would return. His wife went in
                        search of him. It seems he had left the house in dressing-gown, gone
                        to the Rhine bridge and thrown himself into the river. Some sailors
                        rescued him."

                        were stirring times in that part of the world, for revolution was
                        often on the eve of breaking out. The tiny babe was but six months
                        old when the father passed away. There were eight other children, the
                        eldest son being only fourteen. The mother, a sweet, gentle little
                        woman, found herself quite unable to support her large family of
                        growing children. No one could blame her for accepting the hand of her
                        husbands old friend, Ludwig Geyer, in less than a year after the
                        loss of her first husband. Geyer was a man of much artistic talent,
                        an actor, singer, author and painter. He thought little Richard might
                        become a portrait painter, or possibly a musician, since the child had
                        learned to play two little pieces on the piano.
                        I will not try to play the part of judge; for a man is sufficiently
                        judged by his own writings. And, after all, it is rather interesting to
                        meet people who are sincere and not afraid to speak their minds. I will
                        admit that I rather enjoy--a little perversely, perhaps--some of these
                        extreme opinions, where the writers personality stands strongly

                        current of thought that was rather powerful at that time, it was
                        inevitable that this one side of his genius should be first brought to
                        light, and that religious music should be the first to benefit by his
                        work. And also one of the early manifestos[227] of the _Schola Cantorum_
                        dealt with the reform of sacred music by carrying it back to great

                        But Beethoven, it is said, was very susceptible to the charm of the
                        opposite sex. He was however, most careful and high-souled in all his
                        relations with women. He was frequently in love, but it was usually a
                        Platonic affection. For the Countess Julie Guicciardi he protested
                        the most passionate love, which was in a measure returned. She was
                        doubtless his \x22immortal beloved,\x22 whose name vibrates through the
                        Adagio of the \x22Moonlight Sonata,\x22 which is dedicated to her. He wrote
                        her the most adoring letters; but the union, which he seemed to desire
                        so intensely, was never brought about, though the reason is not known.
                        For Bettina von Arnim, Goethes little friend, he conceived a tender
                        affection. Another love of his was for the Countess Marie Erdedy,
                        to whom he dedicated the two fine Trios, Op. 70, but this was also
                        a purely Platonic affection. The composer was unfortunate in his
                        attachments, for the objects were always of a much higher social
                        standing than himself. As he constantly associated with people of rank
                        and culture, it was natural that the young girl nobly born, with all
                        the fascinations of the high bred aristocrat, should attract him far
                        more than the ordinary woman of his own class. And thus it happened
                        that several times he staked his chances of happiness on a love he
                        knew could never be consummated. Yet no one needed a kind, helpful,
                        sympathetic wife more than did our poet-musician. She would have
                        soothed his sensitive soul when he suffered from fancied wrongs,
                        shielded him from intrusion, shared his sorrows and triumphs, and
                        attended to his house-keeping arrangements, which were always in a sad
                        state of confusion. This blissful state was seemingly not for him. It
                        was best for the great genius to devote himself wholly to his divine
                        art, and to create those masterpieces which will always endure.
                        Two things should be particularly noted in his life: the influence of
                        Alexander Ritter--to whom he has shown much gratitude--and his travels
                        in the south of Europe. He made Ritters acquaintance in 1885. This
                        musician was a nephew of Wagners, and died some years ago. His music is
                        practically unknown in France, though he wrote two well-known operas,
                        _Fauler Hans_ and _Wem die Krone_? and was the first composer, according
                        to Strauss, to introduce Wagnerian methods into the _Lied_. He is often
                        discussed in Buelows and Liszts letters. \x22Before I met him,\x22 says
                        Strauss, \x22I had been brought up on strictly classical lines; I had lived
                        entirely on Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, and had just been studying
                        Mendelssohn, Chopin, Schumann, and Brahms. It is to Ritter alone I am
                        indebted for my knowledge of Liszt and Wagner; it was he who showed me
                        the importance of the writings and works of these two masters in the
                        history of art. It was he who by years of lessons and kindly counsel
                        made me a musician of the future (_Zukunftsmusiker_), and set my feet on
                        a road where now I can walk unaided and alone. It was he also who
                        initiated me in Schopenhauers philosophy.\x22
                        And what a splendid variety there is in these melodies: there is the
                        song in Glucks style (Cassandres airs), the pure German _lied_
                        (Marguerites song, \x22Damour lardente flamme\x22), the Italian melody,
                        after Bellini, in its most limpid and happy form (arietta of Arlequin in
                        _Benvenuto_), the broad Wagnerian phrase (finale of _Romeo_), the
                        folk-song (chorus of shepherds in _LEnfance du Christ_), and the freest
                        and most modern recitative (the monologues of Faust), which was
                        Berliozs own invention, with its full development, its pliant outline,
                        and its intricate nuances.[76]"

  communication_note: "By this time his relations with Remenyi had become somewhat irksome
                        and strained and he decided to break off this connection. One morning
                        he suddenly left Weimar, and traveled to Gettingen. There he met
                        Joseph Joachim, whom he had long wished to know, and who was the
                        reigning violinist of his time. Without any announcement, Johannes
                        walked in on the great artist, and they became fast friends almost
                        at once. Joachim had never known what it was to struggle; he had had
                        success from the very start; life had been one long triumph, whereas
                        Johannes had come from obscurity and had been reared in privation. At
                        this time Johannes was a fresh faced boy, with long fair hair and deep
                        earnest blue eyes. Wellner, the distinguished musician of Cologne,
                        thus describes him: \x22Brahms, at twenty, was a slender youth, with
                        long blond hair and a veritable St. Johns head, from whose eyes shone
                        energy and spirit.\x22
                        [Footnote 131: \x22I like Liszts music so much, because he does not bother
                        about other peoples opinions; he says what he wants to say; and the
                        only thing that he troubles about is to say it as well as he possibly
                        can\x22 (Quoted by Hippeau).]
                        It is through this heroic side that he may be considered as an inheritor
                        of some of Beethovens and Wagners thought. It is this heroic side
                        which makes him a poet--one of the greatest perhaps in modern Germany,
                        who sees herself reflected in him and in his hero. Let us consider this
                        hero.

                        declamation of French opera. \x22Our singers believe,\x22 wrote Mersenne, in

                        In 1843 Liszt intended to take Madame with him to Russia, but instead,
                        left her and her children in Paris, with his mother, as the Countess

                        Instead of giving one concert in Moscow, he gave six. Later he played
                        in Bavaria, Saxony and other parts of Germany. He then settled in
                        Weimar for a time, being made Grand Ducal Capellmeister. Then, in
                        1844-45, longing for more success, he toured Spain and Portugal."

  communication_subject: "The importance of musical dictation and the usefulness of the Galin methods for beginners were urged."
  communication_note: "There is no doubt that Beethovens ideas have often inspired,
                        stimulated, and guided Strausss own ideas. One feels an indescribable
                        reflection of the first _Heroic_ and of the _Ode to Joy_ in the key of
                        the first part (E flat); and the last part recalls, even more forcibly,
                        certain of Beethovens _Lieder_. But the heroes of the two composers are
                        very different: Beethovens hero is more classical and more rebellious;
                        and Strausss hero is more concerned with the exterior world and his
                        enemies, his conquests are achieved with greater difficulty, and his
                        triumph is wilder in consequence. If that good Oulibicheff pretends to
                        see the burning of Moscow in a discord in the first _Heroic_, what would
                        he find here? What scenes of burning towns, what battlefields! Besides
                        that there is cutting scorn and a mischievous laughter in _Heldenleben_
                        that is never heard in Beethoven. There is, in fact, little kindness in
                        Strausss work; it is the work of a disdainful hero.
                        In _Heldenleben_ (\x22The Life of a Hero\x22), op. 40,[179] he recovers
                        himself, and with a stroke of his wings reaches the summits. Here there
                        is no foreign text for the music to study or illustrate or transcribe.
                        Instead, there is lofty passion and an heroic will gradually developing
                        itself and breaking down all obstacles. Without doubt Strauss had a
                        programme in his mind, but he said to me himself: \x22You have no need to
                        read it. It is enough to know that the hero is there fighting against
                        his enemies.\x22 I do not know how far that is true, or if parts of the
                        symphony would not be rather obscure to anyone who followed it without
                        the text; but this speech seems to prove that he has understood the
                        dangers of the literary symphony, and that he is striving for pure
                        music."

  communication_note: "MacDowell found that the confining labors at Darmstadt were telling
                        on his strength, so he gave up the position and remained in Frankfort,
                        dividing his time between private teaching and composing. He hoped
                        to secure a few paying concert engagements, as those he had already
                        filled had brought in no money.
                        His music is like these mournful words; it is perhaps even more
                        terrible, more gloomy, for it breathes death.[45] What a contrast: a
                        soul greedy of life and preyed upon by death. It is this that makes his
                        life such an awful tragedy. When Wagner met Berlioz he heaved a sigh of
                        relief--he had at last found a man more unhappy than himself.[46]"

  communication_subject: "Many pamphlets, poems and satires appeared, in which both composers were unmercifully attacked."
  communication_note: "And now there opened to Berlioz a life of stress and struggle,
                        inseparable from such a nature as his. At one moment he would be
                        in the highest heaven of happiness, and the next in the depths of
                        despair. His wifes heavy debts were a load to carry, but he manfully
                        did his best to pay them. We can be sure that every work he ever
                        produced was composed under most trying circumstances, of one kind
                        or another. One of his happiest ventures was a concert of his own
                        compositions, given at the Conservatoire on October 22, 1833. Of it he
                        wrote: \x22The concert, for which I engaged the very best artists, was a
                        triumphant success. My musicians beamed with joy all evening, and to
                        crown all, I found waiting for me a man with long black hair, piercing
                        eyes and wasted form. Catching my hand, he poured forth a flood of
                        burning praise and appreciation. It was Paganini!\x22
                        It is not my intention here to write an appreciation of Cesar Francks
                        genius, but it is not possible to understand the musical movement in
                        Paris of the last fifteen years if one does not take into account the
                        importance of his teaching. The organ class at the Conservatoire, where
                        in 1872 Franck succeeded his old master Benoist, was for a long time, as
                        M. Vincent dIndy says, \x22the true centre for the study of Composition
                        at the Conservatoire. Many of his fellow-workers could never bring
                        themselves to look upon him as one of themselves, because he had the
                        boldness to see in art something other than the means of earning a
                        living. Indeed, Cesar Franck was not of them; and they made him feel
                        this.\x22 But the young students made no mistake about the matter. \x22At this
                        time,\x22 M. dIndy also tells us,[222] \x22that is to say from 1872 to 1876,
                        the three courses of Advanced Musical Composition were given by three
                        professors who were not at all fitted for their work. One was Victor
                        Masse, a composer of simple light operas and a man with no understanding
                        of a symphony, who was very frequently ill and had to entrust his
                        teaching to one of his pupils; another was Henri Reber, an oldish
                        musician with narrow and dogmatic ideas; and the third was Francois
                        Bazin, who was not capable of distinguishing in his pupils fugues a
                        false answer from a true one, and whose highest title to glory is
                        derived from a composition called _Le Voyage en Chine_. So it is not
                        surprising that Cesar Francks teaching, founded on that of Bach and
                        Beethoven, but admitting, as well, imagination and all new and liberal
                        ideas, did, at that time, draw to him all young minds that had lofty
                        ambitions and that were really in love with their art. And so, quite
                        unconsciously, the master attracted to himself all the sincere and
                        artistic talent that was scattered about the different classes of the
                        Conservatoire, as well as that of his outside pupils.\x22
                        [Footnote 89: _Ibid_. \x22A rare peculiarity,\x22 adds Schumann, \x22which
                        distinguishes nearly all his melodies.\x22 Schumann understands why Berlioz
                        often gives as an accompaniment to his melodies a simple bass, or chords
                        of the augmented and diminished fifth--ignoring the intermediate parts.]"

                        occasion I made the acquaintance of the manager of the hotel, who
                        promised that he would interest himself on my behalf. Who was more
                        delighted than I when he told me that on the following Saturday
                        afternoon, 11 December, I was to come and find him, so that he
                        could introduce me to Mme. Cosimas maid and Richard Wagners
                        valet! I arrived at the appointed hour. The visit to the ladys
                        maid was very short. I was advised to come the following day,
                        Sunday, 12 December, at two oclock. I arrived at the right hour,
                        but found the maid and the valet and the manager still at table....
                        Then I went with the maid to the masters rooms, where I waited for
                        about a quarter of an hour until he came. At last Wagner appeared
                        in company with Cosima and Goldmark. I bowed to Cosima very
                        respectfully, but she evidently did not think it worth while to
                        honour me with a single glance. Wagner was going into his room
                        without paying any attention to me, when the maid said to him in a
                        beseeching voice: Ah, Herr Wagner, it is a young musician who
                        wishes to speak to you; he has been waiting for you a long time.
                        Some famous conductors have added the B of Barnum to the three
                        immortal Bs of music--Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Those wielders of
                        the stick are great showmen as well as great musicians.
                        I should like to try to sketch here the strange and arresting
                        personality of the man who in Germany is considered the inheritor of
                        Wagners genius--the man who has had the audacity to write, after
                        Beethoven, an Heroic Symphony, and to imagine himself the hero.
                        Shadows as well as sunshine filled the next few years. The composer
                        was saddened by the passing of his father. Then a favorite sister also
                        left, and last of all his wife passed quietly away, March 3, 1854.
                        With all these sorrows Berlioz was at times nearly beside himself. But
                        as he became calmer he decided, after half a year, to wed a woman who
                        had been of great assistance to him in his work for at least fourteen
                        years."

                        inevitable that this one side of his genius should be first brought to

  communication_note: "This is something more than a burst of modesty. No one had more pride
                        than Michelangelo or Wagner; but both felt the defects of their work
                        like a sharp wound. And although those defects do not prevent their
                        works from being the glory of the human spirit, they are there just the
                        same.
                        On reaching home, Verdi pulled the manuscript out and threw it on the
                        writing table. As he did so a stanza from the book caught his eye; it
                        was almost a paraphrase from the Bible, which had been such a solace
                        to him in his solitary life. He began to read the story and was more
                        and more enthralled by it, yet his resolution to write no more was
                        not altered. However, as the days passed there would be here a line
                        written down, there a melody--until at last, almost unconsciously the
                        opera of \x22Nabucco\x22 came into being.
                        The following year he returned to Moscow and seemed quite his natural
                        self. A fever of energy for work took possession of him. He began a
                        new opera, \x22Eugen Onegin,\x22 and completed his Fourth Symphony, in F
                        minor. The score of the opera was finished in February, 1878, and
                        sent at once to Moscow, where the first performance was given in March
                        1879. In the beginning the opera had only a moderate success, but
                        gradually grew in favor till, after five years, it was performed
                        in St. Petersburg and had an excellent reception. It is considered
                        Tschaikowskys most successful opera, sharing with Glinkas \x22Life of
                        the Tsar\x22 the popularity of Russian opera. In 1881 he was invited
                        to compose an orchestral work for the consecration of the Temple of
                        Christ in Moscow. The \x22Solemn Overture 1812,\x22 Op. 49, was the outcome
                        of this. Later in the year he completed the Second Piano Concerto.
                        The Piano Trio in A minor, \x22To the memory of a great artist,\x22 Op.
                        50, refers to his friend and former master, Nicholas Rubinstein, who
                        passed away in Paris, in 1881.
                        So the one he really loved, and who always loved him, remained alone,
                        without friends, in Paris, where she was a stranger. She drooped in
                        silence and pined slowly away, bedridden, paralysed, and unable to speak
                        during eight years of suffering. Berlioz suffered too, for he loved her
                        still and was torn with pity--\x22pity, the most painful of all
                        emotions.\x22[19] But of what use was this pity? He left Henrietta to
                        suffer alone and to die just the same. And, what was worse, as we learn
                        from Legouve, he let his mistress, the odious Recio, make a scene before
                        poor Henrietta.[20] Recio told him of it and boasted about what she had
                        done."

  communication_note: "About the end of October, 1828, he began to show signs of a serious
                        breakdown. He was living at the home of his brother Ferdinand, in one
                        of the suburbs of the city. Although he revived a little during
                        the early part of November, so that he could resume walks in the
                        neighborhood, the weakness increased, and eleven days passed without
                        food or drink. Lingering till the nineteenth of November, he passed
                        peacefully away, still in his early manhood. The old father, the
                        schoolmaster at the old home, hoped to have his son buried in the
                        little cemetery near by. But Ferdinand knew his brothers wish, to be
                        placed near Beethoven in Wehringer Cemetery. The monument, erected by
                        his friends and admirers the following year, bears, above the name,
                        this inscription:
                        The strain of the production of \x22Euryanthe\x22 told severely on the
                        composers delicate health, and he returned to Dresden in an exhausted
                        state. There was no rest for him here, as official duties were
                        pressing. The malady afflicting his lungs had made rapid progress and
                        he began to fear he should not be long spared to his wife and little
                        ones.
                        This effort was a great incentive to the boys, principally to Robert,
                        who began to arrange things for his little band and composed music for
                        the one hundred fiftieth Psalm. This was in his twelfth year."

                        altogether. Though obliged to retire to the south of France for his
                        healths sake, he founded, in November, 1905, the _Schola_ of
                        Montpellier. This _Schola_ has given about fifteen concerts a year, and
                        has performed some of Bachs cantatas, scenes from Rameaus and Glucks

                        organised an open-air performance of Rameaus _Guirlande_. In January,
                        1908, he produced _Castor et Pollux_ at the Montpellier theatre. The
                        mans activity was incredible, and nothing seemed to tire him. He was
                        planning to start a dramatic training-school at Montpellier for the
                        production of seventeenth and eighteenth century operas, when he died,
                        in November, 1909, at the age of forty-four, and so deprived French art

  communication_note: "On the arrival of Piccini, Madame du Barry began activities, aided by
                        Louis XV himself. She gathered a powerful Italian party about her,
                        and their first act was to induce the Grand Opera management to make
                        Piccini an offer for a new opera, although they had already made the
                        same offer to Gluck. This breach of good faith led to a furious war,
                        in which all Paris joined; it was fierce and bitter while it lasted.
                        Even politics were forgotten for the time being. Part of the press
                        took up one side and part the other. Many pamphlets, poems and satires
                        appeared, in which both composers were unmercifully attacked. Gluck
                        was at the time in Germany, and Piccini had come to Paris principally
                        to secure the tempting fee offered him. The leaders of the feud kept
                        things well stirred up, so that a stranger could not enter a cafe,
                        hotel or theater without first answering the question whether he stood
                        for Gluck or Piccini. Many foolish lies were told of Gluck in his
                        absence. It was declared by the Piccinists that he went away on
                        purpose, to escape the war; that he could no longer write melodies
                        because he was a dried up old man and had nothing new to give France.
                        These lies and false stories were put to flight one evening when the
                        Abbe Arnaud, one of Glucks most ardent adherents, declared in an
                        aristocratic company, that the Chevalier was returning to France with
                        an \x22Orlando\x22 and an \x22Armide\x22 in his portfolio."

                        In the spring of 1896 a Department of Music was founded at Columbia
                        University, of New York, the professorship of which was offered to
                        MacDowell. He had now been living eight years in Boston; his fame as a
                        pianist and teacher was constantly growing; indeed more pupils came to
                        him than he could accept. The prospect of organizing a new department
                        from the very beginning was a difficult task to undertake. At first he
                        hesitated; he was in truth in no hurry to accept the offer, and wished
                        to weigh both sides carefully. But the idea of having an assured
                        income finally caused him to decide in favor of Columbia, and he moved
                        from Boston to New York the following autumn.
                        When he was fifteen Sebastian left his brothers roof and entered the
                        Latin school connected with the Church of St. Michael at L�neburg. It
                        was found he had a beautiful soprano voice, which placed him with the
                        scholars who were chosen to sing in the church service in return for
                        a free education. There were two church schools in Leneburg, and the
                        rivalry between them was so keen, that when the scholars sang in the
                        streets during the winter months to collect money for their support,
                        the routes for each had to be carefully marked out, to prevent
                        collision."

  communication_note: "But the breach, which had started some years before, between Mme. Sand
                        and Chopin, widened as time passed, and they parted in 1847. It was
                        the inevitable, of course. Chopin never had much to say about it; Sand
                        said more, while the students asserted she had killed their beloved
                        master. Probably it all helped to undermine the masters feeble
                        health. His father passed away in 1844, his sister also, of pulmonary
                        trouble; he was lonely and ill himself. He gave his last concert in
                        Paris, February 16, 1848. Though weak he played beautifully. Some one
                        said he fainted in the artists room. The loss of Sand, even though he
                        had long wearied of her was the last drop.
                        The boy had never heard an opera. During the summer, when Carl Formes,
                        then of Vienna, was making a sensation in Hamburg, Lischen got her
                        father to secure places and take them. The opera was the \x22Marriage
                        of Figaro.\x22 Hannes was almost beside himself with delight. \x22Lischen,
                        listen to the music! there was never anything like it,\x22 he cried over
                        and over again. The father, seeing it gave so much pleasure, took the
                        children again to hear another opera, to their great delight.

                        Their purpose is to teach the people a musical language different from
                        that of cultured people; and although it may not be as difficult as is
                        supposed to go from a knowledge of the one to a knowledge of the other,

  communication_note: "With this first venture Wagner was now on the high road to success,
                        and spent a happy winter in the Saxon capital. He could have gone on
                        writing operas like \x22Rienzi,\x22 to please the public, but he aimed far
                        higher. To fuse all the arts in one complete whole was the idea that
                        had been forming in his mind. He first illustrated this in \x22The Flying
                        Dutchman,\x22 and it became the main thought of his later works. This
                        theory made both vocal and instrumental music secondary to the
                        dramatic plan, and this, at that time, seemed a truly revolutionary
                        idea.
                        The next unpopular move he made was to fire a number of the old
                        standbys who had sat in the orchestra for most of its forty-four-year
                        history. \x22I vant yongk blott!\x22 he cried in his then still very thick
                        accent. \x22If dose old chentlemen vant to sleep, let dem sleep in deir
                        houses!\x22
                        The \x22Damnation of Faust,\x22 now finished, was given at the Opera, and
                        was not a success. Berlioz then conceived the idea of going to Russia
                        to retrieve his fortunes. With the help of kind friends, who advanced
                        the money, he was able to carry out the plan. He left for Russia on
                        February 14, 1847. The visits to both St. Petersburg and Moscow proved
                        to be very successful financially as well as artistically. To cap the
                        climax, \x22Romeo and Juliette\x22 was performed at St. Petersburg. Then the
                        King of Prussia, wishing to hear the \x22Faust,\x22 the composer arranged to
                        spend ten days in Berlin: then to Paris and London, where success was
                        also achieved.
                        The work of the early period shows Debussy developing freely and
                        naturally. The independence of his thinking is unmistakable, but it
                        does not run into wilfulness. There is no violent break with the past,
                        but simply the quickening of certain French qualities by the infusion
                        of a new personality. It seemed as if a new and charming miniaturist
                        had appeared, who was doing both for piano and song what had never
                        been done before. The style of the two Arabesques and the more
                        successful of the Ariettes oubliees is perfect. A liberator seemed to
                        have come into music, to take up, half a century later, the work of
                        Chopin--the work of redeeming the art from the excessive objectivity
                        of German thought, of giving it not only a new soul but a new body,
                        swift, lithe and graceful. And that this exquisitely clear, pellucid
                        style could be made to carry out not only gaiety and whimsicality but
                        emotion of a deeper sort, is proved by the lovely \x22Clair de Lune.\x22"

  communication_subject: "\x22 The desire for work was strong within, but his health was failing."
  communication_note: "Berlioz is original in a double sense. By the extraordinary complexity
                        of his genius he touched the two opposite poles of his art, and showed
                        us two entirely different aspects of music--that of a great popular art,
                        and that of music made free.
                        He arrived with three rubles in his pocket. At the school he was told
                        that the only available scholarship was one in bull fiddling. Serge
                        tried for it and won. He was, so far as is known, the first musician
                        to make the barking monster into a solo instrument.
                        But this genius had other characteristics which are less well known,
                        though they are not less unusual. The first is his sense of pure beauty.
                        Berliozs exterior romanticism must not make us blind to this. He had a
                        Virgilian soul; and if his colouring recalls that of Weber, his design
                        has often an Italian suavity. Wagner never had this love of beauty in
                        the Latin sense of the word. Who has understood the Southern nature,
                        beautiful form, and harmonious movement like Berlioz? Who, since Gluck,
                        has recognised so well the secret of classical beauty? Since _Orfeo_ was
                        composed, no one has carved in music a bas-relief so perfect as the
                        entrance of Andromache in the second act of _Les Troyens a Troie_. In
                        _Les Troyens a Carthage_, the fragrance of the Aeneid is shed over the
                        night of love, and we see the luminous sky and hear the murmur of the
                        sea. Some of his melodies are like statues, or the pure lines of
                        Athenian friezes, or the noble gesture of beautiful Italian girls, or
                        the undulating profile of the Albanian hills filled with divine
                        laughter. He has done more than felt and translated into music the
                        beauty of the Mediterranean--he has created beings worthy of a Greek
                        tragedy. His Cassandre alone would suffice to rank him among the
                        greatest tragic poets that music has ever known. And Cassandre is a
                        worthy sister of Wagners Bruennhilde; but she has the advantage of
                        coming of a nobler race, and of having a lofty restraint of spirit and
                        action that Sophocles himself would have loved.
                        The scene of _LEtranger_ is laid in France, by the sea, whose murmuring
                        calm we hear in a symphonic introduction. The fishermen are coming back
                        to port; the fishing has been bad. But one among them, \x22a man about
                        forty years old, with a sad and dignified air,\x22 has been more fortunate
                        than the others. The fishermen envy him, and vaguely suspect him of
                        sorcery. He tries to enter into friendly conversation with them, and
                        offers his catch to a poor family. But in vain; his advances are
                        repulsed and his generosity is eyed with suspicion. He is a
                        stranger--the Stranger.[161] Evening falls, and the angelus rings. Some
                        work-girls come trooping out of their workshop, singing a merry
                        folk-song.[162] One of the young girls, Vita, goes up to the Stranger
                        and speaks to him, for she alone, of all the village, is his friend. The
                        two feel themselves drawn together by a secret sympathy. Vita confides
                        artlessly in the unknown man; they love each other though they do not
                        admit it. The Stranger tries to repress his feelings; for Vita is young
                        and already affianced, and he thinks that he has no right to claim her.
                        But Vita, offended by his coldness, seeks to wound him, and succeeds.
                        In the end he betrays himself. \x22Yes, he loves her, and she knew it well.
                        But now that he has told her so, he will never see her again; and he
                        bids her good-bye.\x22"

                        he \x22measured himself against Beethoven and Mozart\x22 by playing in a
                        public concert; at sixteen years of age he wrote his _Premiere
                        Symphonie_. As he grew older he soaked himself in the music of Bach and
                        Haendel, and was able to compose at will after the manner of Rossini,
                        Verdi, Schumann, and Wagner.[116] He has written excellent music in all
                        styles--the Grecian style, and that of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and
                        eighteenth centuries. His compositions are of every kind: masses, grand
                        operas, light operas, cantatas, symphonies, symphonic poems; music for
                        the orchestra, the organ, the piano, the voice, and chamber music. He is
                        the learned editor of Gluck and Rameau; and is thus not only an artist,
                        but an artist who can talk about his art. He is an unusual figure in
                        France--one would have thought rather to find his home in Germany.
                        In September, 1888, the MacDowells sold their Wiesbaden cottage and
                        returned to America, settling in Boston. Here MacDowell made himself
                        felt as a pianist and teacher. He took many pupils, and made a
                        conspicuous number of public appearances. He also created some of his
                        best work, among which were the two great Sonatas, the \x22Tragica\x22 and
                        \x22Eroica.\x22 One of the important appearances was his playing of the
                        Second Concerto with the Philharmonic Orchestra of New York, under
                        Anton Seidl, in December, 1894."

  communication_note: "And, lastly, I want to speak of the greatest danger of all that menaces
                        music in Germany; _there is too much music in Germany_. This is not a
                        paradox. There is no worse misfortune for art than a super-abundance of
                        it. The music is drowning the musicians. Festival succeeds festival: the
                        day after the Strasburg festival there was to be a Bach festival at
                        Eisenach; and then, at the end of the week, a Beethoven festival at
                        Bonn. Such a plethora of concerts, theatres, choral societies, and
                        chamber-music societies, absorbs the whole life of the musician. When
                        has he time to be alone to listen to the music that sings within him?
                        This senseless flood of music invades the sanctuaries of his soul,
                        weakens its power, and destroys its sacred solitude and the treasures of
                        its thought."

  communication_note: "The composer now threw himself heart and soul into improving the
                        orchestra placed in his charge. Before long he had drilled it to a
                        high state of excellence. Many new operas were put on the stage in
                        quick succession. Thus Weber worked on with great industry for three
                        years. The success he achieved created enemies, and perhaps because of
                        intrigues, envy and ill feeling which had arisen, he resigned his
                        post in 1816. The three years in Prague had been fruitful in new
                        compositions. Several fine piano sonatas, a set of \x22National Songs,\x22
                        and the Cantata, \x22Kampf und Sieg,\x22 (Struggle and Victory). This last
                        work soon became known all over Germany and made the gifted young
                        composer very popular. During this period Weber became engaged to
                        Caroline Brandt, a charming singer, who created the title rele in his
                        opera of \x22Sylvana.\x22
                        Little Giuseppe practised very diligently on his spinet. At first he
                        could only play the first five notes of the scale. Next he tried
                        very hard to find out chords, and one day was made perfectly happy
                        at having sounded the major third and fifth of C. But the next day
                        he could not find the chord again, and began to fret and fume and
                        got into such a temper, that he took a hammer and tried to break
                        the spinet in pieces. This made such a commotion that it brought his
                        father into the room. When he saw what the child was doing, he gave a
                        blow on Giuseppes ear that brought the little fellow to his senses
                        at once. He saw he could not punish the good spinet because he did not
                        know enough to strike a common chord."

                        was born at Saint Germain-en-Laye, France, August 22, 1862. From the
                        very beginning he seemed precociously gifted in music, and began at a
                        very early age to study the piano. His first lessons on the instrument
                        were received from Mme. de Sivry, a former pupil of Chopin. At ten he
                        entered the Paris Conservatoire, obtaining his Solfege medals in 1874,
                        75, and 76, under Lavignac; a second prize for piano playing
                        from Marmontel in 1877, a first prize for accompanying in 1880; an
                        accessory prize for counterpoint and fugue in 1882, and finally the
                        Grande Prix de Rome, with his cantata, \x22LEnfant Prodigue,\x22 in 1884,
                        as a pupil of Guirand.
                        The Belows arrived in Munich in the early autumn, and almost at once
                        began the attraction of Mme. Cosima von Below and Wagner. She,
                        the daughter of Liszt, was but twenty five, of deeply artistic
                        temperament, and could understand the aims of the composer as no
                        other woman had yet done. This ardent attraction led later to Cosimas
                        separation from her husband and finally to her marriage with Wagner."

                        Mahler has got some striking effects from this combination of voices and

                        Beethoven and Liszt. It is incredible that the nineteenth century should
                        have put this combination to so little use; for I think the gain may be
                        poetical as well as musical.

                        composed in 1894 and called his most perfect piece for orchestra,
                        which he never afterward surpassed. There are also Three Nocturnes for
                        orchestra. In piano music, as we have briefly shown, he created a
                        new school for the player. All the way from the two Arabesques just
                        mentioned, through \x22Gardens in the Rain,\x22 \x22The Shadowy Cathedral,\x22 \x22A

                        remarkable Preludes, it is a new world of exotic melody and harmony to
                        which he leads the way. \x22Art must be hidden by art,\x22 said Rameau, long
                        ago, and this is eminently true in Debussys music."

                        Which of us does not feel a little glow of pride at the thought of what
                        has been done in the last thirty years? Here is a town where, before
                        1870, music had fallen to the most miserable depths, which to-day teems
                        with concerts and schools of music--a town where one of the first
                        symphonic schools in Europe has sprung from nothing, a town where an
                        enthusiastic concert-going public has been formed, possessing among its
                        members some great critics with broad interests and a fine, free
                        spirit--all this is the pride of France. And we have, too, a little band
                        of musicians; among them, in the first rank, that great painter of
                        dreams, Claude Debussy; that master of constructive art, Dukas; that
                        impassioned thinker, Alberic Magnard; that ironic poet, Ravel; and those
                        delicate and finished writers, Albert Roussel and Deodat de Severac;
                        without mention of the younger musicians who are in the vanguard of
                        their art. And all this poetic force, though not the most vigorous, is
                        the most original in Europe to-day. Whatever gaps one may find in our
                        musical organisation, still so new, whatever results this movement may
                        lead to, it is impossible not to admire a people whom defeat has
                        aroused, and a generation that has accomplished the magnificent work of
                        reviving the nations music with such untiring perseverance and such
                        steadfast faith. The names of Camille Saint-Saens, Cesar Franck, Charles
                        Bordes, and Vincent dIndy, will remain associated before all others
                        with this work of national regeneration, where so much talent and so
                        much devotion, from the leaders of orchestras and celebrated composers
                        down to that obscure body of artists and music-lovers, have joined
                        forces in the fight against indifference and routine. They have the
                        right to be proud of their work. But for ourselves, let us waste no time
                        in thinking about it. Our hopes are great. Let us justify them.
                        At Oxford, in July, he received the honorary degree of Doctor of
                        Music, and three great concerts were given in his honor, with special
                        performers brought from London. In fact the whole visit to England had
                        been such a success that he repeated the trip in 1794, and received
                        even greater honors. His symphonies were heard on all London
                        programs. He was the lion of the season, and was frequently invited to
                        Buckingham Palace to play for the King and Queen, who always urged
                        him to live in England. Haydn was now sixty-five; he had composed
                        quantities of music, but his greatest work, \x22The Creation,\x22 was not
                        yet written. While in London, Salomon had shown him a poem founded on
                        \x22Paradise Lost,\x22 written years before in the hope that Handel would
                        use it for an oratorio. Haydn decided to try his hand at oratorio on
                        this subject. As he went on, it grew to be a labor of love and prayer.
                        It was finished and performed in Vienna, March 19, 1799, and made
                        a profound impression. The composer at once began work on a second
                        oratorio, founded on Thompsons \x22Seasons.\x22 The desire for work was
                        strong within, but his health was failing. \x22The Seasons gave me my
                        finishing stroke,\x22 he often remarked to friends.

                        of his fellow-citizens, yet he is none the less alone. He sees no one
                        before him who will hold out a helping hand, there is no one by his side
                        on whom he may lean\x22 (Article written 5 May, 1841). As one reads these
                        words, one feels it was Wagners lack of sympathy and not his
                        intelligence that prevented him from understanding Berlioz. In his heart
                        I do not doubt that he knew well who was his great rival. But he never
                        said anything about it--unless perhaps one counts an odd document,
                        certainly not intended for publication, where he (even he) compares him
                        to Beethoven and to Bonaparte (Manuscript in the collection of Alfred

                        Wagner returned to Leipsic in 1834. Soon there came another impetus
                        to this budding genius: he heard for the first time the great singer
                        Wilhelmina Schroeder-Devrient, whose art made a deep impression on
                        him.

                        best work, among which were the two great Sonatas, the \x22Tragica\x22 and
                        \x22Eroica.\x22 One of the important appearances was his playing of the
                        Second Concerto with the Philharmonic Orchestra of New York, under
                        Anton Seidl, in December, 1894.
                        But in Philadelphia he continued his extra-conductorial antics. When
                        the audience hissed an ultra-modern composition, he told them: \x22I am
                        glad you are hissing. It is so much better than apathy.\x22 Another time,
                        when they booed an atonal piece, he repeated it immediately."

  communication_note: "Franz Liszt, in his day the king of pianists, a composer whose
                        compositions still glow and burn with the fire he breathed into them;
                        Liszt the diplomat, courtier, man of the world--always a conqueror!
                        How difficult to tell, in a few pages, the story of a life so complex
                        and absorbing!
                        \x22My nights are often sleepless; I get out of bed, wretched and
                        exhausted, with the thought of a long day before me, which will not
                        bring me a single joy. The society of others tortures me, and I
                        avoid it only to torture myself. Everything I do fills me with
                        disgust. It cant go on for ever. I cant stand such a life any
                        longer. I will kill myself rather than live like this.... I dont
                        believe in anything, and I have only one desire--to sleep so
                        soundly that human misery will exist no more for me. I ought to be
                        able to get such a sleep somehow; it should not be really
                        difficult.\x22
                        Berlioz, like most composers, always wished to produce an opera.
                        \x22Benvenuto Cellini\x22 was the subject finally chosen. It took a long
                        time to write, and perhaps would never have been finished, since
                        Berlioz was so tied to bread-winning journalistic labors, if a kind
                        friend--Ernest Legouve--had not offered to lend him two thousand
                        francs. This loan made him independent for a little time, and gave him
                        the necessary leisure in which to compose.
                        Although it was an urgent matter that young French composers should
                        unite to withstand the general indifference of the public, it was more
                        urgent still that that indifference should be attacked, and that music
                        should be brought within reach of ordinary people. It was a matter of
                        taking up and completing Pasdeloups work in a more artistic and more
                        modern spirit."

  communication_subject: "Berlioz had the sort of mentality which could plan, and also execute, big musical enterprises on a grand scale."
  communication_note: "Arrived in Vienna, that rich, gay, laughter-loving city, where the
                        people loved music and often did much for it, the youths musical
                        talent together with his forlorn appearance and condition won sympathy
                        from a few generous souls, who not only provided a home and took care
                        of his material needs, but gave him also the means to continue his
                        musical studies. Christoph was overcome with gratitude and made the
                        best possible use of his opportunities. For nearly two years he gave
                        himself up to his musical studies.
                        At Strasburg Strauss conducted his _Sinfonia Domestica_, whose programme
                        seems boldly to defy reason, and even good taste. In the symphony he
                        pictures himself with his wife and his boy (_\x22Meiner lieben Frau und
                        unserm Jungen gewidmet\x22_). \x22I do not see,\x22 said Strauss, \x22why I should
                        not compose a symphony about myself; I find myself quite as interesting
                        as Napoleon or Alexander.\x22 Some people have replied that everybody else
                        might not share his interest. But I shall not use that argument; it is
                        quite possible for an artist of Strausss worth to keep us entertained.
                        What grates upon me more is the way in which he speaks of himself. The
                        disproportion between his subject and the means he has of expressing it
                        is too strong. Above all, I do not like this display of the inner and
                        secret self. There is a want of reticence in this _Sinfonia Domestica_.
                        The fireside, the sitting-room, and the bedchamber, are open to
                        all-comers. Is this the family feeling of Germany to-day? I admit that
                        the first time I heard the work it jarred upon me for purely moral
                        reasons, in spite of the liking I have for its composer. But afterwards
                        I altered my first opinion, and found the music admirable. Do you know
                        the programme?
                        One music drama remained to be written--his last. Failing health
                        prevented the completion of the drama until 1882. The first
                        performance of this noble work was given on July 26, followed by
                        fifteen other hearings. After the exertions attending these, Wagner
                        and his wife, their son Siegfried, Liszt and other friends, went to
                        Italy and occupied the Vendramin Palace, on the Grand Canal, Venice.
                        Here he lived quietly and comfortably, surrounded by those he loved.
                        His health failed more and more, the end coming February 13, 1883.
                        The late summer of 1850 brought Schumann an appointment of director of
                        music in Desseldorf, left vacant by the departure of Ferdinand Hiller
                        for Cologne. Schumann and his wife went to Desseldorf the first week
                        of September and were received with open arms. A banquet and concert
                        were arranged, at which some of the composers important works were
                        performed. His duties in the new post were conducting the subscription
                        concerts, weekly rehearsals of the Choral Club and other musical
                        performances. He seemed well content with the situation and it did not
                        require too much of his physical strength."

  communication_subject: "It was awarded unanimously--a thing never known before."
  communication_note: "A year or so later Natalya hired eighty-five of the best musicians in
                        Moscow. After a season of rehearsals Mr. Koussevitzky took his band on
                        tour aboard a steamer--a little gift from his father-in-law.
                        When as a youth Debussy was serving with his regiment in France, he
                        relates of the delight he experienced in listening to the tones of
                        the bugles and bells. The former sounded over the camp for the various
                        military duties; the latter belonged to a neighboring convent and
                        rang out daily for services. The resonance of the bugles and the
                        far-reaching vibrations of the bells, with their overtones and
                        harmonics, were specially noted by the young musician, and used by him
                        later in his music. It is a well-known fact that every tone or
                        sound is accompanied by a whole series of other sounds; they are
                        the vibrations resulting from the fundamental tone. If the tone C
                        is played in the lower octave of the piano, no less than sixteen
                        overtones vibrate with it. A few of these are audible to the ordinary
                        listener, but very keen ears will hear more of them. In Claude
                        Debussys compositions, his system of harmony and tonality is
                        intimately connected with these laws of natural harmonics. His chords,
                        for instance, are remarkable for their shifting, vapory quality; they
                        seem to be on the border land between major and minor--consonance and
                        dissonance; again they often appear to float in the air, without any
                        resolution whatever. It was a new aspect of music, a new style of
                        chord progression. At the same time the young composer was well versed
                        in old and ancient music; he knew all the old scales, eight in number,
                        and used them in his compositions with compelling charm. The influence
                        of the old Gregorian chant has given his music a certain fluidity,
                        free rhythm, a refinement, richness and variety peculiarly its own.
                        At Naples, their next stopping place, Wolfgang played before a
                        brilliant company, and excited so much astonishment, that people
                        declared his power in playing came from a ring he wore on his finger.
                        \x22He wears a charm,\x22 they cried. Mozart smiled, took off the ring and
                        played more brilliantly than ever. Then the enthusiasm was redoubled.
                        The Neapolitans showed them every attention and honor. A carriage
                        was provided for their use, and we have an account of how they drove
                        through the best streets, the father wearing a maroon-colored coat
                        with light blue facings, and Wolfgang in one of apple green, with
                        rose-colored facings and silver buttons."

  communication_note: "His pay as organist was very small, but he also made a little money
                        playing for weddings, christenings and funerals. He also gained a few
                        lire from a collection which it was the habit of artists to make at
                        harvest time, for which he had to trudge from door to door, with a
                        sack upon his back. The poor boys life had few comforts, and this
                        custom of collections brought him into much danger. One night while
                        he was walking toward Le Roncole, very tired and hungry, he did not
                        notice he had taken a wrong path, when suddenly, missing his footing,
                        he fell into a deep canal. It was very dark and very cold and his
                        limbs were so stiff he could not use them. Had it not been for an old
                        woman who was passing by the place and heard his cries, the exhausted
                        and chilled boy would have been carried away by the current.
                        Above Meylan, in a crevice of the mountain, stood a white house amid
                        its vineyards and gardens. It was the home of Mme. Gautier and her two
                        nieces, of whom the younger was called Estelle. When the boy Hector
                        saw her for the first time, he was twelve, a shy, retiring little
                        fellow. Estelle was just eighteen, tall, graceful, with beautiful
                        dusky hair and large soulful eyes. Most wonderful of all, with her
                        simple white gown, she wore pink slippers. The shy boy of twelve fell
                        in desperate love with this white robed apparition in pink slippers.
                        He says himself:

                        said to have begun. In the following year \x22I Lombardi\x22 was produced,
                        followed by \x22Ernani.\x22 Then came in quick succession ten more operas,

                        compose anything fresh, but revised his Michelangelo _Lieder_, and had
                        them published. He made plans for the winter, and rejoiced in the
                        thought of passing it in the country near Gmunden, \x22in perfect quiet,
                        undisturbed, and living only for art.\x22 In his last letter to Faisst, 17
                        September, 1898, he says:
                        The business was to free music from its limited rhythms and from the
                        traditional forms and rules that enclosed it;[81] and, above all, it
                        needed to be free from the domination of speech, and to be released from
                        its humiliating bondage to poetry. Berlioz wrote to the Princess of
                        Wittgenstein, in 1856:--
                        I have tried to unearth M. dIndys strongest characteristics, and I
                        think I have found them in his faith and in his activity, I am only too
                        aware of the pitfalls that have beset me in this attempt; it is always
                        difficult to criticise a mans personality, and it is most difficult
                        when he is alive and still in the midst of his development. Every man is
                        a mystery, not only to others, but to himself. There is something very
                        presumptuous about pretending to know anyone who does not quite know
                        himself. And yet one cannot live without forming opinions; it is a
                        necessity of life. The people we see and know (or say we know), our
                        friends, and those we love, are never what we think them. Often they are
                        not at all like the portrait we conjure up; for we walk among the
                        phantoms of our hearts. But still one must go on having opinions, and go
                        on constructing and creating things, if we do not want to become
                        impotent through inertia. Error is better than doubt, provided we err in
                        good faith; and the main thing is to speak out the thing that one really
                        feels and believes. I hope M. dIndy will forgive me if I have gone far
                        wrong, and that he will see in these pages a sincere effort to
                        understand him and a keen sympathy with himself, and even with his
                        ideas, though I do not always share them. But I have always thought that
                        in life a mans opinions go for very little, and that the only thing
                        that matters is the man himself. Freedom of spirit is the greatest
                        happiness one can know; one must be sorry for those who have not got it.
                        And there is a secret pleasure in rendering homage to anothers splendid
                        creed, even though it is one that we do not ourselves profess."

                        place in Munich June 10, 13, 19, and July 1, 1865. The work was
                        \x22Tristan and Isolde,\x22 perhaps the finest flower of Wagners genius,
                        and already eight years old. Von Below was a superb conductor and
                        Ludwig an inspired Tristan. Wagner was supremely happy. Alas, such
                        happiness did not last. Enemies sprang up all about him. The King
                        himself could not stem the tide of false rumors, and besought the
                        composer to leave Munich for a while, till public opinion calmed
                        down. So Wagner returned to his favorite Switzerland and settled
                        in Triebschen, near Lucerne, where he remained till he removed to
                        Bayreuth in 1872."

                        and the Mass in B Minor. It was the Passion according to St. Matthew
                        that Mendelssohn, about a hundred years later discovered, studied
                        with so much zeal, and performed in Berlin, with so much devotion and
                        success.
                        Richard Strauss is thirty-four years old.[167] He was born in Munich on
                        11 June, 1864. His father, a well-known virtuoso, was first horn in the
                        Royal orchestra, and his mother was a daughter of the brewer Pschorr. He
                        was brought up among musical surroundings. At four years old he played
                        the piano, and at six he composed little dances, _Lieder_, sonatas, and
                        even overtures for the orchestra. Perhaps this extreme artistic
                        precocity has had something to do with the feverish character of his
                        talents, by keeping his nerves in a state of tension and unduly exciting
                        his mind. At school he composed choruses for some of Sophocles
                        tragedies. In 1881, Hermann Levi had one of the young collegians
                        symphonies performed by his orchestra. At the University he spent his
                        time in writing instrumental music. Then Buelow and Radecke made him play
                        in Berlin; and Buelow, who became very fond of him, had him brought to
                        Meiningen as _Musikdirector_. From 1886 to 1889 he held the same post at
                        the _Hoftheater_ in Munich. From 1889 to 1894 he was _Kapellmeister_ at
                        the _Hoftheater_ in Weimar. He returned to Munich in 1894 as
                        _Hofkapellmeister_, and in 1897 succeeded Hermann Levi. Finally, he left
                        Munich for Berlin, where at present he conducts the orchestra of the
                        Royal Opera."

  communication_note: "Cesar Franck: Nearly the whole of his works, including his Sonata, Trio,
                        Quartette, Quintette, Symphonic Variations, Preludes and Fugues, Mass,
                        _Redemption_, _Psyche_, and a part of _Les Beatitudes_.
                        In the spring of 1887, MacDowell, in one of his walks about the town,
                        discovered a deserted cottage on the edge of the woods. It overlooked
                        the town, with the Rhine beyond, and woods on the other side of the
                        river. Templeton Strong, an American composer, was with him at the
                        time, and both thought the little cottage an ideal spot for a home.
                        It was soon purchased, and the young husband and wife lived an idyllic
                        life for the next year. A small garden gave them exercise out of
                        doors, the woods were always enticing and best of all, MacDowell was
                        able to give his entire time to composition. Many beautiful songs
                        and piano pieces were the result, besides the symphonic poem \x22Lamia,\x22
                        \x22Hamlet and Ophelia,\x22 the \x22Lovely Aida,\x22 \x22Lancelot and Elaine,\x22 and
                        other orchestral works.
                        The composer was in sad straits for a while, but fortunately a way
                        opened by means of which he could be free. Count Morzin, where he had
                        conducted the orchestra, was obliged to reduce his establishment and
                        dismissed his band and its director. As soon as this was known, the
                        reigning Prince of Hungary, Paul Anton Esterhezy offered Haydn the
                        post of assistant Capellmeister at his country seat of Eisenstadt.
                        The head Capellmeister, Werner, was old, but the Prince kept him
                        on account of his long service. Haydn, however, was to have
                        entire control of the orchestra, and also of most of the musical
                        arrangements.
                        So the one he really loved, and who always loved him, remained alone,
                        without friends, in Paris, where she was a stranger. She drooped in
                        silence and pined slowly away, bedridden, paralysed, and unable to speak
                        during eight years of suffering. Berlioz suffered too, for he loved her
                        still and was torn with pity--\x22pity, the most painful of all
                        emotions.\x22[19] But of what use was this pity? He left Henrietta to
                        suffer alone and to die just the same. And, what was worse, as we learn
                        from Legouve, he let his mistress, the odious Recio, make a scene before
                        poor Henrietta.[20] Recio told him of it and boasted about what she had
                        done."

                        After a year the Kenigsberg Theater failed and again Wagner was out
                        of employment. Through the influence of his friend Dorn, he secured
                        a directorship at Riga, Minna also being engaged at the theater. At
                        first everything went well; the salary was higher and the people among
                        whom they were placed were agreeable. But before long debts began to
                        press again, and Wagner was dissatisfied with the state of the lyric
                        drama, which he was destined to reform in such a wonderful way. He was
                        only twenty-four, and had seen but little of the world. Paris was the
                        goal toward which he looked with longing eyes, and to the gay French
                        capital he determined to go.
                        Mr. Koussevitzys conductorial gestures are literally high, wide and
                        handsome. His wing-spread, so to speak, is much larger than that of
                        either Mr. Stokowski or Mr. Toscanini, and he has a greater repertoire
                        of unpredictable motions than both of them put together. Time cannot
                        wither, nor custom stale, the infinite variety of his shadow boxing.
                        Nevertheless, he loved her, and loved her desperately. How pathetic it
                        is. One has little inclination to smile when one sees the depths of that
                        desolate heart. Do you think he did not see, as clearly as you or I
                        would see, the wrinkled old face, the indifference of age, the \x22_triste
                        raison_,\x22 in her he idealised? Remember, he was the most ironical of
                        men. But he did not wish to see these things, he wished to cling to a
                        little love, which would help him to live in the wilderness of life."

  communication_note: "Love for women was destined to play a large part in the inner life of
                        Chopin. The first awakening of this feeling came from his admiration
                        of Constantia Gladowska, a beautiful girl and vocal pupil at the
                        Conservatory at Warsaw. Strangely enough he admired the young lady for
                        some time at a distance, and if report be true, never really declared
                        himself to her. But she filled his thoughts by day, and he confessed
                        to dreaming of her each night. When she made her debut in opera, he
                        hung on every note she sang and rejoiced in her success but did not
                        make his feelings known to her. All this pent-up emotion was confined
                        to his piano, in impassioned improvisations.
                        The success of _Pelleas et Melisande_ is due to many things. Some of
                        them are trivial, such as fashion, which has certainly played its part
                        here as it has in all other successes, though it is a relatively weak
                        part; some of them are more important, and arise from something innate
                        in the spirit of French genius; and there are also moral and aesthetic
                        reasons for its success, and, in the widest sense, purely musical
                        reasons.
                        M. Buchors endeavours have been the most extensive and the most
                        fruitful, but he is not alone in individual effort. There was, twenty
                        years ago, in the suburbs of Paris and in the provinces, a large number
                        of well-meaning people who devoted themselves to the work of musical
                        education with sincerity and splendid enthusiasm. But their good works
                        were too isolated, and were swamped by the apathy of the people about
                        them; though sometimes they kindled little fires of love and
                        understanding in art, which only needed coaxing in order to burn
                        brightly; and even their less happy efforts generally succeeded in
                        lighting a few sparks, which were left smouldering in peoples
                        hearts.[250]
                        There is in this a mixture of Christian humility and aristocratic pride.
                        M. dIndy has a sincere desire for the welfare of humanity, and he loves
                        the people; but he treats them with an affectionate kindness, at once
                        protective and tolerant; he regards them as children that must be
                        led.[166]"

                        for the lyric stage. He composed numerous operas; but they were always
                        rejected, for one reason or another. The last, \x22Fierabras,\x22 which was
                        on the point of being produced, was finally given up. The composer
                        became very dejected, and believed himself to be the most unfortunate,
                        the most miserable being on earth. But, fortunately for Schubert,
                        his cheerfulness again asserted itself and the stream of production
                        resumed its flow. With his temperament, at one moment he would be
                        utterly despairing, the next his troubles would seem to be forgotten,
                        and he would be writing a song, a symphony or a sonata. At all
                        events, constant work filled his days. The last year of his life was
                        productive of some of his finest works.
                        The advantage to Verdi of his trips through Europe and to England is
                        shown in \x22Rigoletto,\x22 brought out in Vienna in 1851. In this opera
                        his true power manifests itself. The music shows great advance in
                        declamation, which lifts it above the ordinary Italian style of that
                        time. With this opera Verdis second period begins. Two years later
                        \x22Trovatore\x22 was produced in Rome and had a tremendous success.
                        Each scene brought down thunders of applause, until the very walls
                        resounded and outside people took up the cry, \x22Long live Verdi,
                        Italys greatest composer! Vive Verdi!\x22 It was given in Paris in 1854,
                        and in London the following year. In 1855, \x22La Traviata\x22 was produced
                        in Vienna. This work, so filled with delicate, beautiful music, nearly
                        proved a failure, because the consumptive heroine, who expires on the
                        stage, was sung by a prima donna of such extraordinary stoutness that
                        the scene was received with shouts of laughter. After a number of
                        unsuccessful operas, \x22Un Ballo in Maschera\x22 scored a success in Rome
                        in 1859, and \x22La Forza del Destino,\x22 written for Petrograd, had a
                        recent revival in New York."

                        scientific essays,[125] volumes of verse, and even plays.[126]"

                        through the first hard years of struggle; and, lastly, with an awakening
                        of music in Europe, with a movement which, after the death of Wagner and
                        Franck, attracted the interest of the world by its revival of the art of
                        the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. M. dIndy has been the chief
                        representative of all this artistic evolution in France. By his deeds,
                        by his example, and by his spirit, he was among the first to stir up
                        interest in the musical education of France to-day. He has done more
                        for the advancement of our music than the entire official teaching of
                        the Conservatoires A day will come when, by the force of things and in

                        In 1843, Joseph Napoleon Ney, Prince of Moszkowa, founded in Paris a
                        society for the performance of religious and classical vocal music. This
                        society, which the Prince himself conducted in his own house, set itself
                        to perform the vocal works of the sixteenth and seventeenth

                        Chopin visited Scotland in August of the same year, and stayed with
                        his pupil Miss Jane Stirling, to whom he dedicated the two Nocturnes,
                        Op. 55. He played in Manchester, August 28; his playing was rather
                        weak, but retained all its elegance, finish and grace. He was encored
                        for his familiar Mazurka, Op. 7, No. 1, and repeated it with quite
                        different nuances. One survivor of this audience remarked subsequently
                        in a letter to a friend: \x22My emotion was so great I was compelled to
                        retire to recover myself. I have heard all the celebrated stars of
                        the musical firmament, but never has one left such an impression on my
                        mind.\x22
                        In 1790 Haydn lost the master to whom he was so devotedly attached.
                        He received a pension of a thousand florins on condition that he would
                        retain his post. But Prince Anton, who succeeded his brother, cared
                        nothing for music; Haydn was not obliged to live at the palace and
                        returned to Vienna. Several attempts had already been made to induce
                        him to visit London, but he always had refused. Now there seemed to be
                        no obstacle in the way. One day a visitor called. \x22My name is Salomon;
                        I have come from London to fetch you; we will settle terms to-morrow.\x22
                        On the sail from Calais to Dover, the composer first saw the sea and
                        was reminded of his boyish efforts to describe it in tones."

                        before an object that was meant to represent an anvil. He wore a
                        wig and false beard; his white and manicured hands had nothing of
                        the workman about them; and his easy air, prominent belly, and
                        flabby muscles readily betrayed the actor. With an absurd hammer he
                        struck--as no one else would ever strike--a fantastic-looking
                        sword-blade. One guessed he was a dwarf, because when he walked he
                        bent his legs at the knees. He cried out a great deal, and opened
                        his mouth in a queer fashion. The orchestra also emitted peculiar
                        noises like several beginnings that had nothing to do with one
                        another. Then another actor appeared with a horn in his belt,
                        leading a man dressed up as a bear, who walked on all-fours. He let
                        loose the bear on the dwarf, who ran away, but forgot to bend his
                        knees this time. The actor with the human face represented the
                        hero, Siegfried. He cried out for a long time, and the dwarf
                        replied in the same way. Then a traveller arrived--the god Wotan.
                        He had a wig, too; and, settling himself down with his spear, in a
                        silly attitude, he told Mimi all about things he already knew, but
                        of which the audience was ignorant. Then Siegfried seized some bits
                        that were supposed to represent pieces of a sword, and sang:

                        public was exceptional. I can still see him in the lobby, shaking
                        hands with friends after the concert, trying to hide his emotion, and
                        saying repeatedly: How nice they are--how nice they are!\x22

  communication_note: "The first year in Paris Chopin played at a number of concerts and
                        functions, with ever increasing success. But in spite of the artistic
                        success, his finances ran low, and he began to consider a trip to
                        America. Fortunately he met Prince Radziwill on the street at this
                        time, and was persuaded to play at a Rothschild soiree in the evening.
                        From this moment, it is said, his prospects brightened, and he secured
                        a number of wealthy patrons as pupils. Whether this be true or not, he
                        came to know many titled personages. One has only to turn the pages of
                        his music to note how many pieces are dedicated to Princess This and
                        Countess That. This mode of life was reflected in his music, which
                        became more elegant and aristocratic.
                        The fifty-one _Lieder_ of the _Goethe-Liederbuch_ (1888-89) were
                        composed in groups of _Lieder_: the _Wilhelm Meister Lieder_, the
                        _Divan (Suleika) Lieder_, etc. Wolf even tried to identify himself with
                        the poets line of thought; and in this we often find him in rivalry
                        with Schubert. He avoided using the poems in which he thought Schubert
                        had exactly conveyed the poets meaning, as in _Geheimes_ and _An
                        Schwager Kronos_; but he told Mueller that there were times when Schubert
                        did not understand Goethe at all, because he concerned himself with
                        translating their general lyrical thought rather than with showing the
                        real nature of Goethes characters. The peculiar interest of Wolfs
                        _Lieder_ is that he gives each poetic figure its individual character.
                        The Harpist and Mignon are traced with marvellous insight and restraint;
                        and in some passages Wolf shows that he has re-discovered Goethes art
                        of presenting a whole world of sadness in a single word. The serenity of
                        a great soul soars over the chaos of passions."

                        an apple-tree grows apples, I have no need to trouble myself with other
                        peoples views.\x22[113]
                        In July, 1835, Chopin met his parents at Carlsbad, where his father
                        had been sent by the Warsaw physicians to take the cure. The young
                        musician, now famous, had not seen his parents in nearly five years,
                        and the reunion must have been a happy one. From here he went to
                        Dresden and Leipsic, meeting Schumann and Mendelssohn. Schumann
                        admired the young Pole greatly and wrote much about him in his musical
                        magazine. Mendelssohn considered him a \x22really perfect virtuoso, whose
                        piano playing was both original and masterly,\x22 but he was not sure
                        whether his compositions were right or wrong. Chopin also stopped
                        in Heidelberg on the way to Paris, visiting the father of his pupil
                        Adolph Gutman. He must have been back in Paris about the middle of
                        October, for the papers mention that \x22M. Chopin, one of the most
                        eminent pianists of our epoch, has just made a tour of Germany, which
                        has been for him a real ovation. Everywhere his admirable talent
                        obtained the most flattering reception and excited much enthusiasm.\x22
                        With the home atmosphere he enjoyed, the boy Grieg early became
                        familiar with names of the great composers and their works. One of
                        his idols was Chopin, whose strangely beautiful harmonies were just
                        beginning to be heard, though not yet appreciated. His music must have
                        had an influence over the lads own efforts, for he always remained
                        true to this ideal."

                        In considering Strausss music as a whole, one is at first struck by the
                        diversity of his style. The North and the South mingle; and in his
                        melodies one feels the attraction of the sun. Something Italian had
                        crept into _Tristan_; but how much more of Italy there is in the work of
                        this disciple of Nietzsche. The phrases are often Italian and their
                        harmonies ultra-Germanic. Perhaps one of the greatest charms of
                        Strausss art is that we are able to watch the rent in the dark clouds
                        of German polyphony, and see shining through it the smiling line of an
                        Italian coast and the gay dancers on its shore. This is not merely a
                        vague analogy. It would be easy, if idle, to notice unmistakable
                        reminiscences of France and Italy even in Strausss most advanced works,
                        such as _Zarathustra_ and _Heldenleben_. Mendelssohn, Gounod, Wagner,
                        Rossini, and Mascagni elbow one another strangely. But these disparate
                        elements have a softer outline when the work is taken as a whole, for
                        they have been absorbed and controlled by the composers imagination.
                        In spite of inadequate guidance, music soon kindled the boys soul.
                        He began to try to make music himself, though entirely ignorant of
                        the rules of composition. The first of these efforts, a set of little
                        dances, were written during his seventh or eighth year. It was soon
                        discovered that he could improvise on the piano; indeed he could
                        sketch the disposition of his companions by certain figures on the
                        piano, so exactly and comically that every one burst out laughing
                        at the portraits. He was fond of reading too, much to his fathers
                        delight, and early tried his hand at authorship. He wrote robber
                        plays, which he staged with the aid of the family and such of his
                        youthful friends as were qualified. The father now began to hope
                        his favorite son would become an author or poet; but later Roberts
                        increasing love for music put this hope to flight."

                        M. Buchors endeavours have been the most extensive and the most
                        fruitful, but he is not alone in individual effort. There was, twenty
                        years ago, in the suburbs of Paris and in the provinces, a large number
                        of well-meaning people who devoted themselves to the work of musical
                        education with sincerity and splendid enthusiasm. But their good works
                        were too isolated, and were swamped by the apathy of the people about
                        them; though sometimes they kindled little fires of love and
                        understanding in art, which only needed coaxing in order to burn
                        brightly; and even their less happy efforts generally succeeded in
                        lighting a few sparks, which were left smouldering in peoples
                        hearts.[250]
                        From this time on, one important composition followed another, until
                        increasing illness forshadowed the sad catastrophe of the early part
                        of 1854. He wrote in June 1851, \x22we are all tolerably well, except
                        that I am the victim of occasional nervous attacks; a few days ago I
                        fainted after hearing Radecke play the organ.\x22 These nervous attacks
                        increased in 1852. He could not think music in rapid tempo and wished
                        everything slow. He heard special tones to the exclusion of all
                        others.
                        It must not be imagined that Wagner had learned the lesson of
                        carefulness in money matters, or that, with partial success he always
                        had plenty for his needs. He had expensive tastes, loved fine clothing
                        and beautiful surroundings. Much money, too, was needed to produce new
                        works; so that in reality, the composer was always in debt. The many
                        letters which passed between Wagner and Liszt, which fill two large
                        volumes, show how Liszt clearly recognized the brilliant genius of his
                        friend, and stood ready to help him over financial difficulties, and
                        how Wagner came to lean more and more on Liszts generosity."

                        forget. The other day he and a friend were discussing the concerto
                        played by a certain pianist on his American debut in 1911. Mr.
                        Toscanini remembered it as Beethovens Fourth Piano Concerto; the
                        friend maintained it was the Second.
                        Richard Strauss is both a poet and a musician. These two natures live
                        together in him, and each strives to get the better of the other. The
                        balance is not always well maintained; but when he does succeed in
                        keeping it by sheer force of will the union of these two talents,
                        directed to the same end, produces an effect more powerful than any
                        known since Wagners time. Both natures have their source in a mind
                        filled with heroic thoughts--a rarer possession, I consider, than a
                        talent for either music or poetry. There are other great musicians in
                        Europe; but Strauss is something more than a great musician, for he is
                        able to create a hero.
                        The pronounced musical talent of his boy was a source of pride to Adam
                        Liszt, who spoke of it to all his friends, so that the little fellow
                        began to be called \x22the artist.\x22 The result was that when a concert
                        was to be given at the neighboring Oldenburg, Adam was requested to
                        allow his wonder child to play."

                        shade, produce a painful and confusing impression on the hearer,

                        was laid on Wagners birthday--his fifty-ninth--May 22, 1872. It was
                        planned to give the first performances in the summer of 1876; by that
                        time Wagners longed-for project became a reality.
                        [Footnote 134: The admiration was mutual. M. Saint-Saens even said that
                        without Liszt he could not have written _Samson et Dalila_. \x22Not only
                        did Liszt have _Samson et Dalila_ performed at Weimar, but without him
                        that work would never have come into being. My suggestions on the
                        subject had met with such hostility that I had given up the idea of
                        writing it; and all that existed were some illegible notes.... Then at
                        Weimar one day I spoke to Liszt about it, and he said to me, quite
                        trustingly and without having heard a note, Finish your work; I will
                        have it performed here. The events of 1870 delayed its performance for
                        several years.\x22 (_Revue Musicale_, 8 November, 1901).]"

  communication_note: "And so throughout that music a strong unity is felt among the unruly and
                        often incongruous elements. It is the reflection, so it seems to me, of
                        the soul of the composer. Its unity is not a matter of what he feels,
                        but a matter of what he wishes. His emotion is much less interesting to
                        him than his will, and it is less intense, and often quite devoid of any
                        personal character. His restlessness seems to come from Schumann, his
                        religious feeling from Mendelssohn, his voluptuousness from Gounod or
                        the Italian masters, his passion from Wagner.[181] But his will is
                        heroic, dominating, eager, and powerful to a sublime degree. And that is
                        why Richard Strauss is noble and, at present, quite unique. One feels in
                        him a force that has dominion over men.
                        Theres also an anecdote to the effect that, much earlier, when Serge
                        was still a little boy in his small native town in the province of
                        Tver, in northern Russia, he would arrange the parlor chairs in rows
                        and, with some score open in front of him, conduct them. Once in
                        a while hed stop short and berate the chairs. Then little Serges
                        language was something awful."

  communication_subject: "But he took no rest though in the spring of 1905 he began to show signs of nervous breakdown."
  communication_note: "How mysterious it was, and what a strange agitation it filled me with!
                        There were new effects of orchestration, new timbres, new rhythms, and
                        new subjects; it held the wild poetry of the far-away Middle Ages and
                        old legends, it throbbed with the fever of our hidden sorrows and
                        desires. I did not understand it very well. How should I? The music was
                        taken from works quite unknown to me. It was almost impossible to seize
                        the connection of the ideas on account of the poor acoustics of the
                        room, the bad arrangement of the orchestra, and the unskilled
                        players--all of which served to break up the musical design and spoil
                        the harmony of its colouring. Passages that should have been made
                        prominent were slurred over, and others were distorted by faulty time or
                        want of precision. Even to-day, when our orchestras are seasoned by
                        years of study, I should often be unable to follow Wagners thought
                        throughout a whole scene if I did not happen to know the score, for the
                        outline of a melody is often smothered by the accompaniment, and so its
                        sentiment is lost. If we still find obscurity of meaning in Wagners
                        works you can imagine how much worse it was then. But what did it
                        matter? I used to feel myself stirred with passions that were not human:
                        some magnetic influence seemed to thrill me with both pleasure and pain,
                        and I felt invigorated and happy, for it brought me strength. It seemed
                        as if my childs heart were torn from me and the heart of a hero put in
                        its place."

  communication_note: "And while Wagner, who was more moderate and a closer follower of
                        tradition, sought to establish a compromise (perhaps an impossible one)
                        between music and speech, and to create the new lyric drama, Berlioz,
                        who was more revolutionary, achieved the dramatic symphony, of which the
                        unequalled model to-day is still _Romeo et Juliette_.
                        And now there opened to Berlioz a life of stress and struggle,
                        inseparable from such a nature as his. At one moment he would be
                        in the highest heaven of happiness, and the next in the depths of
                        despair. His wifes heavy debts were a load to carry, but he manfully
                        did his best to pay them. We can be sure that every work he ever
                        produced was composed under most trying circumstances, of one kind
                        or another. One of his happiest ventures was a concert of his own
                        compositions, given at the Conservatoire on October 22, 1833. Of it he
                        wrote: \x22The concert, for which I engaged the very best artists, was a
                        triumphant success. My musicians beamed with joy all evening, and to
                        crown all, I found waiting for me a man with long black hair, piercing
                        eyes and wasted form. Catching my hand, he poured forth a flood of
                        burning praise and appreciation. It was Paganini!\x22
                        The tour began at Winsen, then came Cella. Here a curious thing
                        happened. The piano proved to be a half tone below pitch, but Brahms
                        was equal to the dilemma. Requesting Remenyi to tune his violin a
                        half tone higher, making it a whole tone above the piano, he then,
                        at sight, transposed the Beethoven Sonata they were to play. It was
                        really a great feat, but Johannes performed it as though it were an
                        every day affair."

                        of completion in the spring of 1846. In a letter to the famous singer
                        Jenny Lind, an intimate friend, he writes: \x22I am jumping about my
                        room for joy. If my work turns out half as good as I fancy it is, how

                        When the little girl left the piano, or the harpsichord, as it was
                        called in those days, Wolfgang slipped into her place and began to
                        repeat with his tiny fingers what his father had taught her. He sought
                        the different intervals, and when at last he found them, his little
                        face beamed with joy. In a short time he was able to play all the
                        simple exercises that had been given his sister.
                        It is a lesson for dramatists to see a man suppressing all frivolous
                        trifling and empty episodes in order to concentrate his subject entirely
                        on the inner life of two living souls. In that Wagner is our master, a
                        better, stronger, and more profitable master to follow, in spite of his
                        mistakes, than all the other literary and dramatic authors of his time."

                        earnest. First came some arrangements of trios and quartettes. Then
                        finally he was emboldened to write a quintette for flute, two violins,
                        viola and cello. Two months later he had produced another quintette,
                        which proved to be a little better. At this time Hector was twelve
                        and a half. His father had set his heart on the boys following his
                        footsteps and becoming a doctor; the time was rapidly approaching when
                        a decision had to be made. Doctor Berlioz promised if his son would
                        study anatomy and thoroughly prepare himself in this branch of the
                        profession, he should have the finest flute that could be bought. His
                        cousin Robert shared these anatomical lessons; but as Robert was a
                        good violinist, the two boys spent more time over music than over
                        osteology. The cousin, however, really worked over his anatomy, and
                        was always ready at the lessons with his demonstrations, while Hector
                        was not, and thus drew upon himself many a reprimand. However he
                        managed to learn all his father could teach him, and when he was
                        nineteen consented to go to Paris, with Robert, and--though much
                        against his will--become a doctor."

                        an aria. At last he ventured to announce the result of his secret
                        studies. At this news his relatives were up in arms; they judged
                        his desire for music to be a passing fancy, especially as they knew
                        nothing of any preparatory studies, and realized he had never learned
                        to play any instrument, not even the piano."

  communication_note: "At that time there lived in Palestrina a peasant pair, Sante Pierluigi
                        and his wife Maria, who seem to have been an honest couple, and not
                        grindingly poor, since the will of Santes mother has lately been
                        found, in which she bequeathed a house in Palestrina to her two sons.
                        Besides this she left behind a fine store of bed linen, mattresses and
                        cooking utensils. Maria Gismondi also had a little property.
                        At the time when I was feeling Wagners seductiveness so strongly there
                        were always some carping people among my elders ready to quench my
                        admiration and say with a superior smile: \x22That is nothing. One cant
                        judge Wagner at a concert. You must hear him in the opera-house at
                        Bayreuth.\x22 Since then I have been several times to Bayreuth; I have seen
                        Wagners works performed in Berlin, in Dresden, in Munich, and in other
                        German towns, but I have never again felt the old intoxication. People
                        are wrong to pretend that closer acquaintance with a fine work adds to
                        ones enjoyment of it. It may throw light upon it, but it nips ones
                        imagination and dispels the mystery. The puzzling fragments one hears at
                        concerts will take on splendid proportions on account of all the mind
                        adds to them. That epic poem of the _Niebelungen_ was once like a forest
                        in our dreams, where strange and awful beings flashed before our vision
                        and then vanished. Later on, when we had explored all its paths, we
                        discovered that order and reason reigned in the midst of this apparent
                        jungle; and when we came to know the least wrinkle on the faces of its
                        inhabitants, the confusion and emotion of other days no longer filled
                        us.

                        has the misfortune to resemble me in everything,\x22 said Berlioz; \x22and we
                        love each other like a couple of twins.\x22[33] \x22Ah, my poor Louis,\x22 he
                        wrote to him, \x22what should I do without you?\x22 A few months afterwards he
                        learnt that Louis had died in far-away seas."

                        appearance, but in language and sentiment. Here were low hills covered
                        with pines and beeches, here charming valleys; there wide plains
                        where the flowering broom flourished in profusion. It was the Walloon
                        country, and the Francks claimed descent from a family of early
                        Walloon painters of the same name. The earliest of these painters was
                        Jerome Franck, born away back in 1540. Thus the name Franck had stood

  communication_note: "The Belows arrived in Munich in the early autumn, and almost at once
                        began the attraction of Mme. Cosima von Below and Wagner. She,
                        the daughter of Liszt, was but twenty five, of deeply artistic
                        temperament, and could understand the aims of the composer as no
                        other woman had yet done. This ardent attraction led later to Cosimas
                        separation from her husband and finally to her marriage with Wagner.
                        He sprang to the piano and began to play. The small fingers could not
                        master the more intricate parts, but gave sufficient idea of how he
                        intended the piece to sound.
                        Three years had passed swiftly by since little Wolfgang Mozart began
                        to study music the night of his fathers fortieth birthday. He had
                        made marvelous progress and already the fame of his powers had passed
                        beyond the narrow limits of his native town. Leopold Mozart had no
                        means other than the salary which he received from the Court. His
                        childrens musical gifts induced the father to turn them to advantage,
                        both to supply the family needs and to provide the children a broad
                        education in music. He determined to travel with the children. A
                        first experiment in January, 1762, had proved so successful that the
                        following September they set out for Vienna. Wolfgang was now six
                        years old and Marianne eleven.
                        The musical weakness of that time was a very curious thing, and has
                        given many people the impression that France has never been a musical
                        nation. Historically speaking, nothing could be more wrong. Certainly
                        there are races more gifted in music than others; but often the seeming
                        differences of race are really the differences of time; and a nation
                        appears great or little in its art according to what period of its
                        history we consider. England was a musical nation until the Revolution
                        of 1688; France was the greatest musical nation in the sixteenth
                        century; and the recent publications of M. Henry Expert have given us a
                        glimpse of the originality and perfection of the Franco-Belgian art
                        during the Renaissance. But without going back as far as that, we find
                        that Paris was a very musical town at the time of the Restoration, at
                        the time of the first performance of Beethovens symphonies at the
                        Conservatoire, and the first great works of Berlioz, and the Italian
                        Opera. In Berliozs _Memoires_ you can read about the enthusiasm, the
                        tears, and the feeling, that the performances of Glucks and Spontinis
                        operas aroused; and in the same book one sees clearly that this musical
                        warmth lasted until 1840, after which it died down little by little, and
                        was succeeded by complete musical apathy in the second Empire--an apathy
                        from which Berlioz suffered cruelly, so that one may even say he died
                        crushed by the indifference of the public. At this time Meyerbeer was
                        reigning at the Opera. This incredible weakening of musical feeling in
                        France, from 1840 to 1870, is nowhere better shown than in its romantic
                        and realistic writers, for whom music was an hermetically sealed door.
                        All these artists were \x22_visuels_,\x22 for whom music was only a noise.
                        Hugo is supposed to have said that Germanys inferiority was measured by
                        its superiority in music.[204] \x22The elder Dumas detested,\x22 Berlioz says,
                        \x22even bad music.\x22[205] The journal of the Goncourts calmly reflects the
                        almost universal scorn of literary men for music. In a conversation
                        which took place in 1862 between Goncourt and Theophile Gautier,
                        Goncourt said:"

                        The \x22Four Serious Songs,\x22 were published in the summer of 1896. At
                        this time Brahms had been settled in his rooms at Ischl scarcely a
                        fortnight when he was profoundly shaken by news of Clara Schumanns
                        death. She passed peacefully away in Frankfort, and was laid beside
                        her husband, in Bonn, May 24. Brahms was present, together with many
                        musicians and celebrities.
                        Friedhold had initiated him in former days, and he now comes to
                        reproach him for his crime, and to bring him before the Order, who will
                        judge him. In the original version of the poem Guntram complies, and
                        sacrifices his passion to his vow. But while Strauss had been travelling
                        in the East he had conceived a sudden horror for this Christian
                        annihilation of will, and Guntram revolts along with him, and refuses to
                        submit to the rules of his Order. He breaks his lute--a symbol of false
                        hope in the redemption of humanity through faith--and rouses himself
                        from the glorious dreams in which he used to believe, for he sees they
                        are shadows that are scattered by the light of real life. He does not
                        abjure his former vows; but he is not the same man he was when he made
                        them. While his experience was immature he was able to believe that a
                        man ought to submit himself to rules, and that life should be governed
                        by laws. A single hour has enlightened him. Now he is free and
                        alone--alone with his spirit. \x22I alone can lessen my suffering; I alone
                        can expiate my crime. Through myself alone God speaks to me; to me alone
                        God speaks. _Ewig einsam_.\x22 It is the proud awakening of individualism,
                        the powerful pessimism of the Super-man. Such an expression of feeling
                        gives the character of action to renouncement and even to negation
                        itself, for it is a strong affirmation of the will.
                        In 1848, Schumann, who loved children dearly and often stopped his
                        more serious work to write for them, composed the \x22Album for the
                        Young,\x22 Op. 68, a set of forty-two pieces. The title originally was:
                        \x22Christmas Album for Children who like to play the Piano.\x22 How many
                        children, from that day to this have loved those little pieces, the
                        \x22Happy Farmer,\x22 \x22Wild Rider,\x22 \x22First Loss,\x22 \x22Reapers Song,\x22 and all
                        the rest. Even the great pianists of our time are not above performing
                        these little classics in public. They are a gift, unique in musical
                        literature, often imitated, but never equaled by other writers.
                        Schumann wrote of them: \x22The first thing in the Album I wrote for my
                        oldest childs birthday. It seems as if I were beginning my life as a
                        composer anew, and there are traces of the old human here and there.
                        They are decidedly different from Scenes from Childhood which are
                        retrospective glances by a parent, and for elders, while Album for
                        the Young contains hopes, presentments and peeps into futurity _for
                        the young_.\x22"

                        musicians education was not complete unless he went to Italy, for
                        this country stood first as the home of music. Leopold Mozart had made
                        a couple of trips to Vienna with his children, the account of which
                        need not detain us here. He had decided that Wolfgang must go to
                        Italy, and breathe in the atmosphere of that land of song. And so in
                        December, 1769, father and son set out for the sunny south, with high
                        hopes for success."

                        for representation, one also recognises its blemishes and, above all,
                        its unevenness. The orchestration in the first act is often rather thin,
                        and the plot lacks solidity. There are gaps and unaccountable holes, and
                        melodious lines left suspended in space. From beginning to end, lyrical
                        bursts of melody are broken by declamations, or, what is worse, by
                        dissertations. Frenzied whirlwinds of passion stop suddenly to give
                        place to recitatives of explanation or argument. And although these
                        recitatives are nearly always a great relief, although these
                        metaphysical reveries have a character of barbarous cunning that one
                        relishes, yet the superior beauty of the movements of pure poetry,
                        emotion, and music is so evident, that this musical and philosophical
                        drama serves to give one a distaste for philosophy and drama and
                        everything else that cramps and confines music.
                        The honor was great, for a boy of eleven and a half. To conduct the
                        service, and receive the respect and deference due the position, quite
                        overwhelmed the lad. Honors of this kind were very pleasant, but,
                        alas, there was no money attached to the position, and this was what
                        the straitened family needed most sorely. The responsibilities of the
                        position and the confidence of Neefe spurred Ludwig on to a passion of
                        work which nothing could check. He began to compose; three sonatas
                        for the pianoforte were written about this time. Before completing his
                        thirteenth year, Ludwig obtained his first official appointment from
                        the Elector; he became what is called cembalist in the orchestra,
                        which meant that he had to play the piano in the orchestra, and
                        conduct the band at rehearsals. With this appointment there was no
                        salary attached either, and it was not until a year later when he was
                        made second organist to the Court, under the new Elector, Max Franz,
                        that he began to receive a small salary, equal to about sixty-five
                        dollars a year. We have seen that the straits of the family had not
                        prevented Ludwig from pursuing his musical studies with great ardor.
                        With his present attainments and his ambition for higher achievements,
                        he longed to leave the little town of Bonn, and see something of the
                        great world. Vienna was the center of the musical life of Germany; the
                        boy dreamed of this magical city by day as he went about his routine
                        of work, and by night as he lay on his poor narrow cot. Like Haydn,
                        Vienna was the goal of his ambition. When a kind friend, knowing his
                        great longing, came forward with an offer to pay the expenses of the
                        journey, the lad knew his dream was to become a reality. In Vienna he
                        would see the first composers of the day; best of all he would see and
                        meet the divine Mozart, the greatest of them all."

                        Soon after Leopolds return to Salzburg, he was stricken with illness,
                        and passed away May 28, 1787. The news reached the composer shortly
                        after he had achieved one of the greatest successes of his life. The
                        performances of his latest opera, \x22The Marriage of Figaro,\x22 had been
                        hailed with delight by enthusiastic crowds in Vienna and Prague; its
                        songs were heard at every street corner, and village ale house. \x22Never
                        was anything more complete than the triumph of Mozart and his Nozze

                        genius; it is as impossible to describe as to paint sunbeams.\x22
                        Schumann had intervals of reprieve from these morbid dreams, and
                        he again began to compose with renewed--almost abnormal--vigor and
                        productiveness.

                        father teaching him violin and his big brother Ignaz, the piano.
                        Franz, in his eagerness to learn soon outstripped his home teachers,
                        and told them he could go on alone. It was then decided he should go
                        to the parish choir master, Holzer, to learn piano, violin, organ,
                        singing and thorough bass. Soon Holzer was astonished at the boys
                        progress. \x22Whenever I begin to teach him anything I find he knows
                        it already; I never had such a pupil before.\x22 By the time Franz was
                        eleven, his voice had come out so well that he was given the place of
                        head soprano in the parish church, and played violin solos whenever
                        they occurred in the service. He had even begun at home to compose and
                        write down little piano pieces and songs. The parents considered that
                        this remarkable talent should be cultivated further, if possible, in
                        order that it might assist the slender purse of the family. There was
                        a choir school, called the Convict, which trained its boys for the
                        Imperial Chapel. If Franz could prove his ability to enter this
                        school, he would receive free education in return for his services."

                        host, who gave him every encouragement, even to placing his castle at
                        Pressburg at his disposal for a concert. The Princess, too, was most
                        cordial, and gave the boy costly presents when they left.
                        All the rest of the journey to Vienna, Wolfgang was the life of the
                        party, eager to know the name and history of everything they met. At
                        the custom-house on the frontier, he made friends with the officials
                        by playing for them on his violin, and thus secured an easy pass for
                        the party.

                        freest, but she is not yet.... Modern music is like the classic
                        Andromeda, naked and divinely beautiful. She is chained to a rock
                        on the shores of a vast sea, and awaits the victorious Perseus who
                        shall loose her bonds and break in pieces the chimera called

                        1870 to 1900 found a home there. Without it, the greater part of the

                        rare merit of being able to anticipate public opinion by ten or eleven
                        years, and in some ways it has formed the public mind and obliged it to

  communication_note: "Christoph Willibald Gluck has been called the \x22regenerator of the
                        opera\x22 for he appeared just at the right moment to rescue opera
                        from the deplorable state into which it had fallen. At that time the
                        composers often yielded to the caprices of the singers and wrote to
                        suit them, while the singers themselves, through vanity and ignorance,
                        made such requirements that opera itself often became ridiculous.
                        Gluck desired \x22to restrict the art of music to its true object, that
                        of aiding the effect of poetry by giving greater expression to words
                        and scenes, without interrupting the action or the plot.\x22 He wrote
                        only operas, and some of his best works keep the stage to-day. They
                        are simple in design yet powerful in appeal: very original and stamped

                        About this time a distant relative, one Johann Mathias Frankh by name,
                        arrived at the Haydn cottage on a visit. He was a schoolmaster at
                        Hainburg, a little town four leagues away. During the regular evening
                        concert he took particular notice of Josef and his toy violin. The
                        childs sweet voice indicated that he had the makings of a good
                        musician. At last he said: \x22If you will let me take Sepperl, I will

                        huge jug he poured a brownish-red, viscous liquid into a couple of
                        tumblers. The Maestros companion says it tasted like a mixture of
                        castor oil, hair tonic and pitch."

                        is the decline of musical taste in France--and, I rather think, in all
                        Europe--since 1835 or 1840. Berlioz says in his _Memoires_: \x22Since the
                        first performance of _Romeo et Juliette_ the indifference of the French
                        public for all that concerns art and literature has grown incredibly\x22
                        (_Memoires_, II, 263). Compare the shouts of excitement and the tears
                        that were drawn from the dilettanti of 1830 (_Memoires_, I, 81), at the
                        performances of Italian operas or Glucks works, with the coldness of
                        the public between 1840 and 1870. A mantle of ice covered art then. How
                        much Berlioz must have suffered. In Germany the great romantic age was
                        dead. Only Wagner remained to give life to music; and he drained all
                        that was left in Europe of love and enthusiasm for music. Berlioz died
                        truly of asphyxia.]
                        The tests for organ prizes have always been four. First, the
                        accompaniment of a plain chant, chosen for the occasion; second, the
                        performance of an organ piece with pedals; third, the improvising of
                        a fugue; fourth, improvising a piece in sonata form. Both the
                        improvisations to be on themes set by the examiners. Cesar at once
                        noticed that the two themes could be combined in such a way that one
                        would set off the other. He set to work, and soon became so absorbed
                        in this interweaving of melodies that the improvisation extended to
                        unaccustomed lengths, which bewildered the examiners and they decided
                        to award nothing to such a tiresome boy. Benoist, teacher of this
                        ingenious pupil, explained matters with the result that Cesar was
                        awarded a second prize for organ."

                        quite easily be perfect of its kind; but it is rarely that a work lofty
                        aim attains perfection. A landscape of little dells and smiling meadows
                        is brought more readily into pleasing harmony than a landscape of
                        dazzling Alps, torrents, glaciers, and tempests; for the heights may
                        sometimes overwhelm the picture and spoil the effect. And so it is with
                        certain great pages of _Tristan_. We may take for example the verses
                        which tell of excruciating expectation--in the second act, Isoldes
                        expectation on the night filled with desire; and, in the third act,
                        Tristans expectation, as he lies wounded and delirious, waiting for the
                        vessel that brings Isolde and death--or we may take the Prelude, that
                        expression of eternal desire that is like a restless sea for ever
                        moaning and beating itself upon the shore.
                        The cause of the artistic success of _Pelleas et Melisande_ is of a more
                        specially French character, and marks a reaction that is at once
                        legitimate, natural, and inevitable; I would even say it is vital--a
                        reaction of French genius against foreign art, and especially against
                        Wagnerian art and its awkward representatives in France.
                        The lessons with Mr. Buitrago continued for several years, and then he
                        was taken to a professional piano teacher, Paul Desvernine, with
                        whom he remained till he was fifteen. During this time he received
                        occasional lessons from the brilliant Venezuelan pianist, Teresa
                        Carreeo, who admired his gifts and later played his piano concertos.
                        After a year the Kenigsberg Theater failed and again Wagner was out
                        of employment. Through the influence of his friend Dorn, he secured
                        a directorship at Riga, Minna also being engaged at the theater. At
                        first everything went well; the salary was higher and the people among
                        whom they were placed were agreeable. But before long debts began to
                        press again, and Wagner was dissatisfied with the state of the lyric
                        drama, which he was destined to reform in such a wonderful way. He was
                        only twenty-four, and had seen but little of the world. Paris was the
                        goal toward which he looked with longing eyes, and to the gay French
                        capital he determined to go."

                        [Footnote 79: It is amusing to find Wagner comparing Berlioz with Auber,
                        as the type of a true French musician--Auber and his mixed Italian and
                        German opera. That shows how Wagner, like most Germans, was incapable of
                        grasping the real originality of French music, and how he saw only its
                        externals. The best way to find out the musical characteristics of a
                        nation is to study its folk-songs. If only someone would devote himself
                        to the study of French folk-song (and there is no lack of material),
                        people would realise perhaps how much it differs from German folk-song,
                        and how the temperament of the French race shows itself there as being
                        sweeter and freer, more vigorous and more expressive.]
                        The boy Felix had a wonderful gift for making friends. One day he
                        suddenly caught sight of Carl Maria von Weber walking along the
                        streets of Berlin, near his home. He recognized the famous composer at
                        once, as he had lately visited his parents. The boys dark eyes glowed
                        with pleasure at the recognition, and tossing back his curls, he
                        sprang forward and threw his arms about Webers neck, begging him to
                        go home with him. When the astonished musician recovered himself, he
                        presented the boy to Jules Benedict, his young friend and pupil who
                        walked at his side, saying, \x22This is Felix Mendelssohn.\x22 For response
                        Felix, with a bright look, seized the young mans hand in both his
                        own. Weber stood by smiling at the boys enthusiasm. Again Felix
                        besought them to come home with him, but Weber had to attend a
                        rehearsal. \x22Is it for the opera?\x22 the boy cried excitedly.
                        There is much more grandeur and originality in his _Also sprach
                        Zarathustra, Tondichtung frei, nach Nietzsche_ (\x22Thus spake Zarathustra,
                        a free Tone-poem, after Nietzsche\x22), op. 30.[174] Its sentiments are
                        more broadly human, and the programme that Strauss has followed never
                        loses itself in picturesque or anecdotic details, but is planned on
                        expressive and noble lines. Strauss protests his own liberty in the face
                        of Nietzsches. He wishes to represent the different stages of
                        development that a free spirit passes through in order to arrive at that
                        of Super-man. These ideas are purely personal, and are not part of some
                        system of philosophy. The sub-titles of the work are: _Von den
                        Hinterweltern_ (\x22Of Religious Ideas\x22), _Von der grossen Sehnsucht_ (\x22Of
                        Supreme Aspiration\x22), _Von den Freuden und Leidenschaften_ (\x22Of Joys and
                        Passions\x22), _Das Grablied_ (\x22The Grave Song\x22), _Von der Wissenschaft_
                        (\x22Of Knowledge\x22), _Der Genesende_ (\x22The Convalescent\x22--the soul
                        delivered of its desires), _Das Tanzlied_ (\x22Dancing Song\x22), _Nachtlied_
                        (\x22Night Song\x22). We are shown a man who, worn out by trying to solve the
                        riddle of the universe, seeks refuge in religion. Then he revolts
                        against ascetic ideas, and gives way madly to his passions. But he is
                        quickly sated and disgusted and, weary to death, he tries science, but
                        rejects it again, and succeeds in ridding himself of the uneasiness its
                        knowledge brings by laughter--the master of the universe--and the merry
                        dance, that dance of the universe where all the human sentiments enter
                        hand-in-hand--religious beliefs, unsatisfied desires, passions,
                        disgust, and joy. \x22Lift up your hearts on high, my brothers! Higher
                        still! And mind you dont forget your legs! I have canonised laughter.
                        You super-men, learn to laugh!\x22[175] And the dance dies away and is lost
                        in ethereal regions, and Zarathustra is lost to sight while dancing in
                        distant worlds. But if he has solved the riddle of the universe for
                        himself, he has not solved it for other men; and so, in contrast to the
                        confident knowledge which fills the music, we get the sad note of
                        interrogation at the end."

                        their encouragement so lifted the spirits of Frau Clara that she was
                        able to resume her musical activities."

                        host, who gave him every encouragement, even to placing his castle at

                        cordial, and gave the boy costly presents when they left.
                        Theres also an anecdote to the effect that, much earlier, when Serge
                        was still a little boy in his small native town in the province of
                        Tver, in northern Russia, he would arrange the parlor chairs in rows
                        and, with some score open in front of him, conduct them. Once in
                        a while hed stop short and berate the chairs. Then little Serges
                        language was something awful.

                        \x22According to certain writers, who wish to reduce everything to a
                        dead level and deduce all things from a single cause, Cesar Franck
                        was a mystic whose true domain was religious music. Nothing could
                        be wider of the mark. The public is given to generalisations, and
                        is too easily gulled. They will judge a composer on a single work,
                        or a group of works, and class him once and for all.... In
                        reality, my father was a man of all-round accomplishments. As a
                        finished musician, he was master of every form of composition. He
                        wrote both religious and secular music--melodies, dances,
                        pastorales, oratorios, symphonic poems, symphonies, sonatas, trios,
                        and operas. He did not confine his attention to any particular kind
                        of work to the exclusion of other kinds; he was able to express
                        himself in any way he chose.\x22[226]"

  communication_note: "The first year in Paris Chopin played at a number of concerts and
                        functions, with ever increasing success. But in spite of the artistic
                        success, his finances ran low, and he began to consider a trip to
                        America. Fortunately he met Prince Radziwill on the street at this
                        time, and was persuaded to play at a Rothschild soiree in the evening.
                        From this moment, it is said, his prospects brightened, and he secured
                        a number of wealthy patrons as pupils. Whether this be true or not, he
                        came to know many titled personages. One has only to turn the pages of
                        his music to note how many pieces are dedicated to Princess This and
                        Countess That. This mode of life was reflected in his music, which
                        became more elegant and aristocratic.
                        And now there opened to Berlioz a life of stress and struggle,
                        inseparable from such a nature as his. At one moment he would be
                        in the highest heaven of happiness, and the next in the depths of
                        despair. His wifes heavy debts were a load to carry, but he manfully
                        did his best to pay them. We can be sure that every work he ever
                        produced was composed under most trying circumstances, of one kind
                        or another. One of his happiest ventures was a concert of his own
                        compositions, given at the Conservatoire on October 22, 1833. Of it he
                        wrote: \x22The concert, for which I engaged the very best artists, was a
                        triumphant success. My musicians beamed with joy all evening, and to
                        crown all, I found waiting for me a man with long black hair, piercing
                        eyes and wasted form. Catching my hand, he poured forth a flood of
                        burning praise and appreciation. It was Paganini!\x22
                        These compositions alone place him in the front rank of contemporary
                        musicians. They abound in faults; but their qualities are so rare, and
                        his soul shines so clearly through them, and such fine sincerity
                        breathes in them, that I have not the courage to dwell on their
                        weaknesses. So I shall content myself with remarking, in passing, that
                        the orchestration is inadequate and awkward, and that the young musician
                        should strive to make it fuller and more delicate; and though he shows
                        great ease in composition, he is often too impetuous, and should resist
                        this tendency; and that, lastly, there are sometimes traces of bad taste
                        in the music and reminiscences of the classics--all of which are the
                        sins of youth, which age will certainly cure."

                        up, and there is a merry discussion. We hear a double fugue in which the
                        theme of the man and the theme of the woman contradict each other with
                        exasperating and ludicrous obstinacy; and the man has the last word.
                        Finally there is the apotheosis of the child and family life."

  communication_note: "Who does not know his passion for Henrietta Smithson? It was a sad
                        story. He fell in love with an English actress who played Juliet (Was it
                        she or Juliet whom he loved?). He caught but a glance of her, and it was
                        all over with him. He cried out, \x22Ah, I am lost!\x22 He desired her; she
                        repulsed him. He lived in a delirium of suffering and passion; he
                        wandered about for days and nights like a madman, up and down Paris and
                        its neighbourhood, without purpose or rest or relief, until sleep
                        overcame him wherever it found him--among the sheaves in a field near
                        Villejuif, in a meadow near Sceaux, on the bank of the frozen Seine near
                        Neuilly, in the snow, and once on a table in the Cafe Cardinal, where he
                        slept for five hours, to the great alarm of the waiters, who thought he
                        was dead.[17] Meanwhile, he was told slanderous gossip about Henrietta,
                        which he readily believed. Then he despised her, and dishonoured her
                        publicly in his _Symphonie fantastique_, paying homage in his bitter
                        resentment to Camille Moke, a pianist, to whom he lost his heart without
                        delay.
                        And now came a time of struggling for Mozart. His small salary was cut
                        off and he had but one pupil. He had numerous friends, however, and
                        soon his fortunes began to mend. He was lodging with his old friends
                        the Webers. Aloysia, his former beloved, had married; Madame Weber
                        and her two unmarried daughters were now in Vienna and in reduced
                        circumstances. Mozarts latest opera, \x22The Elopement,\x22 had brought
                        him fame both in Vienna and Prague, and he had the patronage of many
                        distinguished persons, as well as that of Emperor Josef.
                        Although it was an urgent matter that young French composers should
                        unite to withstand the general indifference of the public, it was more
                        urgent still that that indifference should be attacked, and that music
                        should be brought within reach of ordinary people. It was a matter of
                        taking up and completing Pasdeloups work in a more artistic and more
                        modern spirit."

  communication_subject: "Like Lamoureux, he has hardly caught the spirit of French romantic works--of Berlioz, and still less of Franck and his school; and he seems to have but lukewarm sympathy for the more recent developments of French music."
  communication_note: "At this time Wagners success, in its turn, began to make itself felt.
                        For this M. Lamoureux, whose concerts began in 1882, was chiefly
                        responsible. Wagners influence considerably helped forward the progress
                        of French art, and aroused a love for music in people other than
                        musicians; and, by his all-embracing personality and the vast domain of
                        his work in art, not only engaged the interest of the musical world, but
                        that of the theatrical world, and the world of poetry and the plastic
                        arts. One may say that from 1885 Wagners work acted directly or
                        indirectly on the whole of artistic thought, even on the religious and
                        intellectual thought of the most distinguished people in Paris. And a
                        curious historical witness of its world-wide influence and momentary
                        supremacy over all other arts was the founding of the _Revue
                        Wagnerienne_, where, united by the same artistic devotion, were found
                        writers and poets such as Verlaine, Mallarme, Swinburne, Villiers de
                        lIsle Adam, Huysmans, Richepin, Catulle Mendes, Edouard Rod, Stuart
                        Merrill, Ephraim Mikhael, etc., and painters like Fantin-Latour, Jacques
                        Blanche, Odilon Redon; and critics like Teodor de Wyzewa, H.S.
                        Chamberlain, Hennequin, Camille Benoit, A. Ernst, de Fourcaud, Wilder,
                        E. Schure, Soubies, Malherbe, Gabriel Mourey, etc. These writers not
                        only discussed musical subjects, but judged painting, literature, and
                        philosophy, from a Wagnerian point of view. Hennequin compared the
                        philosophic systems of Herbert Spencer and Wagner. Teodor de Wyzewa made
                        a study of Wagnerian literature--not the literature that commentated and
                        the paintings that illustrated Wagners works, but the literature and
                        the painting that were inspired by Wagners principles--from Egyptian
                        statuary to Degass paintings, from Homers writings to those of
                        Villiers de lIsle Adam! In a word, the whole universe was seen and
                        judged by the thought of Bayreuth. And though this folly scarcely lasted
                        more than three or four years--the length of the life of that little
                        magazine--Wagners genius dominated nearly the whole of French art for
                        ten or twelve years.[209] An ardent musical propaganda by means of
                        concerts was carried on among the public; and the young intellectuals of
                        the day were won over. But the finest service that Wagnerism rendered to
                        French art was that it interested the general public in music; although
                        the tyranny its influence exercised became, in time, very stifling.
                        Many of the Friday afternoon customers were in such a rush to catch
                        trains for their Main Line suburbs that they seldom remained long
                        enough to give conductor and orchestra a well-deserved ovation. So
                        nobody ever quite knew whether the dead-pan Stoky was in earnest
                        or moved by an impish sense of humor when, following the usual thin
                        smattering of applause, he said:
                        While his father lived the boy was sure of sympathy and affection,
                        though circumstances were of the poorest. But the good man passed away
                        when the boy was quite young, and then matters were much worse. He was
                        gradually neglected until he was at last left to shift for himself."

  communication_note: "The political revolution of 1848, was the cause of many refugees
                        crowding into Hamburg on their way to America. One of these was the
                        violinist, Edward Remenyi, a German Hungarian Jew, whose real name
                        was Hofmann. But it seemed Remenyi was really in no haste to leave
                        Hamburg. Johannes, engaged as accompanist at the house of a wealthy
                        patron, met the violinist and was fascinated by his rendering of
                        national Hungarian music. Remenyi, on his side, saw the advantage of
                        having such an accompanist for his own use. So it happened the two
                        played together frequently for a time, until the violinist disappeared
                        from Germany, for several years. He reappeared in Hamburg at the close
                        of the year 1852. He was then twenty-two, while Brahms was nineteen.
                        It was suggested that the two musicians should do a little concert
                        work together. They began to plan out the trip which became quite
                        a tour by the time they had included all the places they wished to
                        visit."

  communication_note: "The first time I saw M. dIndy was at a concert of the _Societe
                        nationale_, in the Salle Pleyel, in 1888. They were playing several of
                        Francks works; among others, for the first time, his admirable _Theme,
                        fugue, et variation_, for the harmonium and pianoforte, a composition in
                        which the spirit of Bach is mingled with a quite modern tenderness.
                        Franck was conducting, and M. dIndy was at the pianoforte. I shall
                        always remember his reverential manner towards the old musician, and how
                        careful he was to follow his directions; one would have said he was a
                        diligent and obedient pupil. It was a touching homage from one who had
                        already proved himself a master by works like _Le Chant de la cloche_,
                        _Wallenstein_, _La Symphonie sur un theme montagnard_, and who was
                        perhaps at that time better known and more popular than Cesar Franck
                        himself. Since then twenty years have passed, and I still see M. dIndy
                        as I saw him that evening; and, whatever may happen in the future, his
                        memory for me will be always associated with that of the grand old
                        artist, presiding with his fatherly smile over the little gathering of
                        the faithful.
                        It is difficult to learn anything of the boyhood and youth of this
                        rare French composer. Even his young manhood and later life were so
                        guarded and secluded that few outside his intimate circle knew much
                        of the man, except as mirrored in his music. After all that is just as
                        the composer wished, to be known through his compositions, for in
                        them he revealed himself. They are transparent reflections of his
                        character, his aims and ideals."

  communication_note: "After a summer spent quietly with his parents at Landaas, he began
                        to prepare for coming musical activities. The next season he gave
                        his first concert in Bergen, at which the piano pieces of Op. 1, Four
                        Songs for Alto, and a String Quartet were played. With the proceeds
                        of this concert he bought orchestral and chamber music, and began to
                        study score, which he had not previously learned to do. In the spring
                        of 1863--he was hardly twenty then--he left home and took up his
                        residence in Copenhagen, a much larger city, offering greater
                        opportunities for an ambitious young musician. It was also the home of
                        Niels W. Gade, the foremost Scandinavian composer.
                        In music he learned a great deal from his friend Schalk,[184] a
                        professor at the Vienna Conservatoire; but, like Berlioz, he got most of
                        his education from the libraries, and spent months in reading the scores
                        of the great masters. Not having a piano, he used to carry Beethovens
                        sonatas to the Prater Park in Vienna and study them on a bench in the
                        open air. He soaked himself in the classics--in Bach and Beethoven, and
                        the German masters of the _Lied_--Schubert and Schumann. He was one of
                        the young Germans who was passionately fond of Berlioz; and it is due to
                        Wolf that France was afterwards honoured in the possession of this great
                        artist, whom French critics, whether of the school of Meyerbeer, Wagner,
                        Franck, or Debussy, have never understood. He was also early a friend of
                        old Anton Bruckner, whose music we do not know in France, neither his
                        eight symphonies, nor his _Te Deum_, nor his masses, nor his cantatas,
                        nor anything else of his fertile work. Bruckner had a sweet and modest
                        character, and an endearing, if rather childish, personality. He was
                        rather crushed all his life by the Brahms party; but, like Franck in
                        France, he gathered round him new and original talent to fight the
                        academic art of his time.
                        In this book, Faith is shown to be everything--the beginning and the
                        end. We learn how it fans the flame of genius, nourishes thought,
                        directs work, and governs even the modulations and the style of a
                        musician. There is a passage in it that one would think was of the
                        thirteenth century; it is curious, but not without dignity:
                        M. Saint-Saens has good reason for liking Liszt, for Liszt was also a
                        lover of freedom, and had shaken off traditions and pedantry, and
                        scorned German routine; and he liked him, too, because his music was a
                        reaction from the stiff school of Brahms.[131] He was enthusiastic about
                        Liszts work, and was one of the earliest and most ardent champions of
                        that new music of which Liszt was the leading spirit--of that
                        \x22programme\x22 music which Wagners triumph seemed to have nipped in the
                        bud, but which has suddenly and gloriously burst into life again in the
                        works of Richard Strauss. \x22Liszt is one of the great composers of our
                        time,\x22 wrote M. Saint-Saens; \x22he has dared more than either Weber, or
                        Mendelssohn, or Schubert, or Schumann. He has created the symphonic
                        poem. He is the deliverer of instrumental music.... He has proclaimed
                        the reign of free music.\x22[132] This was not said impulsively in a moment
                        of enthusiasm; M. Saint-Saens has always held this opinion. All his life
                        he has remained faithful to his admiration of Liszt--since 1858, when he
                        dedicated a _Veni Creator_ to \x22the Abbe Liszt,\x22 until 1886, when, a few
                        months after Liszts death, he dedicated his masterpiece, the _Symphonic
                        avec orgue_, \x22To the memory of Franz Liszt.\x22[133]"

  communication_note: "While little Sebastian Bach was laboriously copying out music by pale
                        moonlight, because of his great love for it, another child of the same
                        age was finding the greatest happiness of his life seated before an
                        old spinet, standing in a lumber garret. He was trying to make music
                        from those half dumb keys. No one had taught him how to play; it was
                        innate genius that guided his little hands to find the right harmonies
                        and bring melody out of the old spinet.
                        Of their three children, the boy died very young. Of the girls,
                        Blandine became the wife of emile Ollivier, a French literary man and
                        statesman. Her sister, Cosima, married first Hans von Below and later
                        Richard Wagner.
                        \x22In listening to that symphony I had a lively impression that any
                        little street boy in a blue blouse and red bonnet would understand
                        it perfectly. I have no hesitation in giving precedence to that
                        work over Berliozs other works; it is big and noble from the first
                        note to the last; a fine and eager patriotism rises from its first
                        expression of compassion to the final glory of the apotheosis, and
                        keeps it from any unwholesome exaggeration. I want gladly to
                        express my conviction that that symphony will fire mens courage
                        and will live as long as a nation bears the name of France.\x22[104]
                        It is not by any means the oldest and most celebrated musical
                        institutions which have taken the largest share in this evolution of
                        music in the last thirty years."

  communication_note: "His devotion and his faith have not been in vain. The name of M. dIndy
                        will be associated in history, not only with fine works, but with great
                        works: with the _Societe Nationale de Musique_, of which he is
                        president; with the _Schola Cantorum_, which he founded with Charles
                        Bordes, and which he directs; with the young French school of music, a
                        group of skilful artists and innovators, to whom he is a kind of elder
                        brother, giving them encouragement by his example and helping them
                        through the first hard years of struggle; and, lastly, with an awakening
                        of music in Europe, with a movement which, after the death of Wagner and
                        Franck, attracted the interest of the world by its revival of the art of
                        the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. M. dIndy has been the chief
                        representative of all this artistic evolution in France. By his deeds,
                        by his example, and by his spirit, he was among the first to stir up
                        interest in the musical education of France to-day. He has done more
                        for the advancement of our music than the entire official teaching of
                        the Conservatoires A day will come when, by the force of things and in
                        spite of all resistance, such a man will take the place that belongs to
                        him at the head of the organisation of music in France.
                        Wolfs work consists chiefly, as we have already seen, of _Lieder_, and
                        these _Lieder_ are characterised by the application to lyrical music of
                        principles established by Wagner in the domain of drama. That does not
                        mean he imitated Wagner. One finds here and there in Wolfs music
                        Wagnerian forms, just as elsewhere there are evident reminiscences of
                        Berlioz. It is the inevitable mark of his time, and each great artist in
                        his turn contributes his share to the enrichment of the language that
                        belongs to us all. But the real Wagnerism of Wolf is not made up of
                        these unconscious resemblances; it lies in his determination to make
                        poetry the inspiration of music. \x22To show, above all,\x22 he wrote to
                        Humperdinck in 1890, \x22that poetry is the true source of my music.\x22
                        With such an intense nature, friendship and love were two vital forces
                        controlling life and action. Chopin was devoted to his friends; he
                        clung to them with effusive ardor, incomprehensible to those less
                        sensitive and romantic. With Titus Woyciechowski he was heart to heart
                        in closest intimacy, and wrote him the most adoring letters when they
                        chanced to be separated. Titus was less demonstrative, but always
                        remained devoted.

                        the utmost care, taught his little boy history, literature, geography,
                        languages, even music. Hector was a most romantic, impressionable
                        child, who peopled nature with fairies and elves, as he lay under
                        great trees and dreamed fantastic day dreams. Poetry and romantic
                        tales were his delight and he found much to feed his imagination in
                        his fathers large library.
                        While his father lived the boy was sure of sympathy and affection,
                        though circumstances were of the poorest. But the good man passed away
                        when the boy was quite young, and then matters were much worse. He was
                        gradually neglected until he was at last left to shift for himself.

                        death\x22 (21 August, 1868--six months before his death).]"

  communication_note: "But it is especially in Strausss subjects that caprice and a disordered
                        imagination, the enemy of all reason, seem to reign. We have seen that
                        these poems try to express in turn, or even simultaneously, literary
                        texts, pictures, anecdotes, philosophical ideas, and the personal
                        sentiments of the composer. What unity is there in the adventures of Don
                        Quixote or Till Eulenspiegel? And yet unity is there, not in the
                        subjects, but in the mind that deals with them. And these descriptive
                        symphonies with their very diffuse literary life are vindicated by their
                        musical life, which is much more logical and concentrated. The caprices
                        of the poet are held in rein by the musician. The whimsical Till
                        disports himself \x22after the old form of rondeau,\x22 and the folly of Don
                        Quixote is told in \x22ten variations on a chivalrous theme, with an
                        introduction and finale.\x22 In this way, Strausss art, one of the most
                        literary and descriptive in existence, is strongly distinguished from
                        others of the same kind by the solidarity of its musical fabric, in
                        which one feels the true musician--a musician brought up on the great
                        masters, and a classic in spite of everything.
                        The rest of the summer was spent in the beautiful Dauphiny country,
                        working on the \x22Damnation of Faust.\x22 In the fall he returned to Paris.
                        The vision of his Ophelia, as he used to call Miss Smithson, was
                        seldom long absent from his thoughts, and he now went to the house
                        where she used to live, thinking himself very lucky to be able to find
                        lodging there. Meeting the old servant, he learned Miss Smithson was
                        again in Paris, and would manage a new English theater, which was
                        to open in a few days. But Berlioz was planning a concert of his own
                        compositions, and did not trust himself to see the woman he had so
                        long adored until this venture was over. It happened, however, that
                        some friends induced her to attend the concert, the success of which
                        is said to have been tremendous. The composer had the happiness of
                        meeting the actress the same evening. The next day he called on her.
                        Their engagement lasted nearly a year, opposed by her mother and
                        sister, and also by Hectors family. The following summer Henrietta
                        Smithson, all but ruined from her theatrical ventures, and weak from
                        a fall, which made her a cripple for some years, was married to Hector
                        Berlioz, in spite of the opposition of their two families.

  communication_note: "Shortly after his return home he was saddened by the loss of his
                        good, kind, patient mother, and a few months later his little sister
                        Margaretha passed away. No doubt these sorrows were expressed in some
                        of his most beautiful compositions. But brighter days followed the
                        dark ones. He became acquainted with the Breuning family, a widow
                        lady and four children, three boys and a girl, all young people. The
                        youngest boy and the girl became his pupils, and all were very fond
                        of him. He would stay at their house for days at a time and was always
                        treated as one of the family. They were cultured people, and in
                        their society Beethovens whole nature expanded. He began to take an
                        interest in the literature of his own country and in English authors
                        as well. All his spare time was given to reading and composition.
                        A valuable acquaintance with the young Count Von Waldstein was made
                        about this time. The Count called one day and found the composer at
                        his old worn out piano, surrounded by signs of abject poverty. It
                        went to his heart to see that the young man, whose music he so greatly
                        admired should have to struggle for the bare necessities of life while
                        he himself enjoyed every luxury. It seemed to him terribly unjust. He
                        feared to offend the composers self-respect by sending him money, but
                        shortly after the call Beethoven was made happy by the gift of a fine
                        new piano, in place of his old one. He was very grateful for this
                        friendship and later dedicated to the Count one of his finest sonatas,
                        the Op. 53, known as the \x22Waldstein Sonata.\x22"

                        In 1859, when Peter had finished his studies at the School of
                        Jurisprudence, he received an appointment in the Ministry of Justice,
                        as clerk of the first class. This would have meant much to some young
                        men, but did not greatly impress Peter, as he did not seem to take his
                        work very seriously. During the three years in which he held the post,
                        he followed the fashion of the day, attended the opera and theater,
                        meanwhile receiving many impressions which molded his character and
                        tastes. The opera \x22Don Giovanni,\x22 Mozarts masterpiece, made a deep
                        impression upon him, also the acting of Adelaide Ristori and the
                        singing of Lagrona."

  communication_note: "Even the successes of \x22Don Giovanni,\x22 which was received with thunders
                        of applause, failed to remedy his desperate financial straits. Shortly
                        after this his pupil and patron, Prince Karl Lichnowsky, proposed he
                        should accompany him to Berlin. Mozart gladly consented, hoping for
                        some betterment to his fortunes. The King of Prussia received him
                        with honor and respect and offered him the post of Capellmeister, at
                        a salary equal to about three thousand dollars. This sum would have
                        liberated him from all his financial embarrassments, and he was
                        strongly tempted to accept. But loyalty to his good Emperor Josef
                        caused him to decline the offer.
                        The significance of M. Saint-Saens in art is a double one, for one must
                        judge him from the inside as well as the outside of France. He stands
                        for something exceptional in French music, something which was almost
                        unique until just lately: that is, a great classical spirit and a fine
                        breadth of musical culture--German culture, we must say, since the
                        foundation of all modern art rests on the German classics. French music
                        of the nineteenth century is rich in clever artists, imaginative writers
                        of melody, and skilful dramatists; but it is poor in true musicians, and
                        in good and solid workmanship. Apart from two or three splendid
                        exceptions, our composers have too much the character of gifted amateurs
                        who compose music as a pastime, and regard it, not as a special form of
                        thought, but as a sort of dress for literary ideas. Our musical
                        education is superficial: it may be got for a few years, in a formal
                        way, at a Conservatoire, but it is not within reach of all; the child
                        does not breathe music as, in a way, he breathes the atmosphere of
                        literature and oratory; and although nearly everyone in France has an
                        instinctive feeling for beautiful writing, only a very few people care
                        for beautiful music. From this arise the common faults and failings in
                        our music. It has remained a luxurious art; it has not become, like
                        German music, the poetical expression of the peoples thought.

                        of every young piano student the world over; the eighteen Nocturnes,
                        of starry night music; the entrancing Mazurkas, fifty-two in number.
                        One marvels, in merely glancing over the list, that the composer, who
                        lived such a super-sensitive hectic life, whose days were so occupied
                        with lesson giving, ever had the time to create such a mass of music,
                        or the energy to write it.
                        Sometimes Saint-Saens reminds me of one of our eighteenth-century
                        writers. Not a writer of the _Encyclopedie_, nor one of Rousseaus camp,
                        but rather of Voltaires school. He has a clearness of thought, an
                        elegance and precision of expression, and a quality of mind that make
                        his music \x22not only noble, but very noble, as coming of a fine race and
                        distinguished family.\x22[118]
                        For the next two years MacDowell did much composing. Then in June 1884
                        he returned to America, and in July was married to his former pupil,
                        Miss Marian Nevins, a union which proved to be ideal for both. Shortly
                        after this event the young couple returned to Europe."

                        Then there is the freedom of his rhythms. Schumann, who was nearest to
                        Berlioz of all musicians of that time, and, therefore, best able to
                        understand him, had been struck by this since the composition of the
                        _Symphonic fantastique_,[87] He wrote:--
                        In music he learned a great deal from his friend Schalk,[184] a
                        professor at the Vienna Conservatoire; but, like Berlioz, he got most of
                        his education from the libraries, and spent months in reading the scores
                        of the great masters. Not having a piano, he used to carry Beethovens
                        sonatas to the Prater Park in Vienna and study them on a bench in the
                        open air. He soaked himself in the classics--in Bach and Beethoven, and
                        the German masters of the _Lied_--Schubert and Schumann. He was one of
                        the young Germans who was passionately fond of Berlioz; and it is due to
                        Wolf that France was afterwards honoured in the possession of this great
                        artist, whom French critics, whether of the school of Meyerbeer, Wagner,
                        Franck, or Debussy, have never understood. He was also early a friend of
                        old Anton Bruckner, whose music we do not know in France, neither his
                        eight symphonies, nor his _Te Deum_, nor his masses, nor his cantatas,
                        nor anything else of his fertile work. Bruckner had a sweet and modest
                        character, and an endearing, if rather childish, personality. He was
                        rather crushed all his life by the Brahms party; but, like Franck in
                        France, he gathered round him new and original talent to fight the
                        academic art of his time."

                        who would keep abreast of the time. This music is so saturated with

                        strength, its fascinating rhythms, bring a new message. It is
                        different from the music of other countries and at once attracts by
                        its unusual melodies and its richness of harmony.
                        But M. dIndy, like a courageous apostle, has continued the direction of
                        the _Schola_ with a firm hand and unwearying care, despite his varied
                        activities as composer, professor, and _Kapellmeister_; and he is one of
                        the surest and most reliable guides for a young school of French music.
                        And if his mind is rather given to abstractions, and his moods are
                        sometimes rather combative, and certain prejudices (which are not always
                        musical ones) make him lean towards ideals of reason and immovable
                        faith--and if at times his followers unconsciously distort his ideas,
                        and try to dam the stream which flows from life itself, I am convinced
                        it is only the passing evidence of a reaction, perhaps a natural one,
                        against the exaggerations they have encountered, and that the _Schola_
                        will always know how to avoid the rocks where revolutionaries of the
                        past have run aground and become the conservatives of the morrow. I hope
                        the _Schola_ will never grow into the kind of aristocratic school that
                        builds walls about itself, but will always open wide its doors and
                        welcome every new force in music, even to such as have ideals opposed to
                        its own. Its future renown and the well-being of French art can only
                        thus be maintained.
                        Since 1875 he had been writing music: _Lieder_, sonatas, symphonies,
                        quartets, etc., and already his _Lieder_ held the most important place.
                        He also composed in 1883 a symphonic poem on the _Penthesilea_ of his
                        friend Kleist.
                        In spite of the changes of taste and the campaign of the press, the
                        Opera has remained to this day as it was in the time of Meyerbeer and
                        Gounod and their disciples. But it would be foolish to pretend that it
                        has not its public. The receipts show well enough that _Faust_ is in
                        greater favour than _Siegfried_ or _Tristan_, not to speak of the more
                        recent works of the new French school, which cannot be acclimatised
                        there."

  communication_note: "And now came to Berlioz a new revelation--nothing less than the
                        revelation of the art of Shakespeare. An English company of actors had
                        come to Paris, and the first night Hamlet was given, with Henrietta
                        Smithson--who five years later became his wife--as Ophelia.
                        It was the thirteenth of April, 1823. A very large audience filled the
                        Redouten Saal. When Franz stepped upon the platform, he perceived the
                        great Beethoven seated near. A great joy filled him. Now he was to
                        play for the great man, whom all his young life he had worshiped from
                        afar. He put forth every effort to be worthy of such an honor. Never
                        had he played with such fire; his whole being seemed thrilled--never
                        had he achieved such success. In the admiration which followed,
                        Beethoven rose, came upon the platform, clasped the boy in his arms
                        and kissed him repeatedly, to the frantic cheers of the audience.
                        In spite of appearances, Wagner is a classicist compared with Berlioz;
                        he carried on and perfected the work of the German classicists; he made
                        no innovations; he is the pinnacle and the close of one evolution of
                        art. Berlioz began a new art; and one finds in it all the daring and
                        gracious ardour of youth. The iron laws that bound the art of Wagner are
                        not to be found in Berliozs early works, which give one the illusion of
                        perfect freedom.[92]"

                        a private hospital near Bonn. Here he remained till the end of July,
                        1856, when the end came.
                        Tschaikowsky held the operas of Mozart before him as his ideal. He
                        cared little for Wagner, considering his music dramas to be built on
                        false principles. Thus his first opera, \x22Voivoda,\x22 composed in 1866,
                        evidently had his ideal, Mozart, clearly in mind. It is a somewhat
                        curious fact that Tschaikowsky, who was almost revolutionary in other
                        forms of music, should go back to the eighteenth century for his ideal
                        of opera. Soon after it was completed \x22Voivoda\x22 was accepted to be
                        produced at the Moscow Grand Theater. The libretto was written by
                        Ostrowsky, one of the celebrated dramatists of the day. The first
                        performance took place on January 30, 1869. We are told it had several
                        performances and considerable popular success. But the composer was
                        dissatisfied with its failure to win a great artistic success, and
                        burnt the score. He did the same with his next work, an orchestral
                        fantaisie, entitled \x22Fatum.\x22 Again he did the same with the score of
                        a complete opera, \x22Undine,\x22 finished in 1870, and refused at the St.
                        Petersburg Opera, where he had offered it.
                        \x22Music,\x22 wrote Berlioz to C. Lobe, in 1852, \x22is the most poetic,
                        the most powerful, the most living of all arts. She ought to be the
                        freest, but she is not yet.... Modern music is like the classic
                        Andromeda, naked and divinely beautiful. She is chained to a rock
                        on the shores of a vast sea, and awaits the victorious Perseus who
                        shall loose her bonds and break in pieces the chimera called
                        Routine.\x22
                        The advantage to Verdi of his trips through Europe and to England is
                        shown in \x22Rigoletto,\x22 brought out in Vienna in 1851. In this opera
                        his true power manifests itself. The music shows great advance in
                        declamation, which lifts it above the ordinary Italian style of that
                        time. With this opera Verdis second period begins. Two years later
                        \x22Trovatore\x22 was produced in Rome and had a tremendous success.
                        Each scene brought down thunders of applause, until the very walls
                        resounded and outside people took up the cry, \x22Long live Verdi,
                        Italys greatest composer! Vive Verdi!\x22 It was given in Paris in 1854,
                        and in London the following year. In 1855, \x22La Traviata\x22 was produced
                        in Vienna. This work, so filled with delicate, beautiful music, nearly
                        proved a failure, because the consumptive heroine, who expires on the
                        stage, was sung by a prima donna of such extraordinary stoutness that
                        the scene was received with shouts of laughter. After a number of
                        unsuccessful operas, \x22Un Ballo in Maschera\x22 scored a success in Rome
                        in 1859, and \x22La Forza del Destino,\x22 written for Petrograd, had a
                        recent revival in New York."

  communication_note: "The boy had never heard an opera. During the summer, when Carl Formes,
                        then of Vienna, was making a sensation in Hamburg, Lischen got her
                        father to secure places and take them. The opera was the \x22Marriage
                        of Figaro.\x22 Hannes was almost beside himself with delight. \x22Lischen,

                        and over again. The father, seeing it gave so much pleasure, took the
                        children again to hear another opera, to their great delight.
                        The strain of the production of \x22Euryanthe\x22 told severely on the
                        composers delicate health, and he returned to Dresden in an exhausted
                        state. There was no rest for him here, as official duties were
                        pressing. The malady afflicting his lungs had made rapid progress and
                        he began to fear he should not be long spared to his wife and little
                        ones.
                        There were many noted musicians in the French capital at that time,
                        and many opportunities for success. The young German produced his
                        letters of introduction and received many promises of assistance from
                        conductors and directors. Delighted with his prospects he located in
                        the \x22heart of elegant and artistic Paris,\x22 without regarding cost.
                        M. Chevillard had been asked to conduct, not one of the works of our
                        recent masters, like Debussy or Dukas, whose style he renders to
                        perfection, but Francks _Les Beatitudes_, a work whose spirit he does
                        not, to my mind, quite understand. The mystic tenderness of Franck
                        escapes him, and he brings out only what is dramatic. And so that
                        performance of _Les Beatitudes_, though in many respects fine, left an
                        imperfect idea of Francks genius."

                        Hensel, the young painter. This was a keen disappointment to all, but
                        Fanny was not to be separated from her family, as on Mendelssohns

                        The music of Berlioz is conceived on large lines, in broad masses of
                        tone color, with new harmonies and imposing effects. He won a noble
                        place in art through many trials and hardships. His music is the
                        expression, the reflection of the mental struggles of a most intense
                        nature. The future will surely witness a greater appreciation of its

                        friends had formed of the composers genius. Its reception at the
                        rehearsals proved success was certain, and the Elector who was
                        present, joined the performers in expressing his unqualified approval.
                        At home the progress of the work was followed with deepest interest.
                        The first performance of \x22Idomeneo\x22 took place on January 29, 1781.
                        Leopold and Marianne journeyed to Munich to witness Wolfgangs
                        triumph. It was a proud, happy moment for all three; the enthusiastic
                        acclaim which shook the theater seemed to the old father, who watched
                        with swimming eyes the sea of waving hands around him, to set the seal
                        of greatness on his sons career.
                        \x22I am weary of life; and I am forced to see that belief in
                        absurdities is necessary to human minds, and that it is born in
                        them as insects are born in swamps.\x22[40]
                        In 1881, when he was twenty, he applied for the position of head piano
                        teacher in the Darmstadt Conservatory, and was accepted. It meant
                        forty hours a week of drudgery, and as he preferred to live in
                        Frankfort, he made the trip each day between the two towns. Besides
                        this he went once a week to a castle about three hours away, and
                        taught some little counts and countesses, really dull and sleepy
                        children, who cared but little if anything for music. However the
                        twelve hours spent in the train each week, were not lost, as he
                        composed the greater part of his Second Modern Suite for piano, Op.
                        14; the First Modern Suite had been written in Frankfort the year
                        before. He was reading at this period a great deal of poetry, both
                        German and English, and delving into the folk and fairy lore of
                        romantic Germany. All these imaginative studies exerted great
                        influence on his subsequent compositions, both as to subject and
                        content.
                        I do not think it is an exaggeration to assert that the majority of
                        listeners at a high-class concert or recital are absolutely bored. How
                        can it be otherwise, when the composers represented are mere names to
                        them? Why should the general public appreciate a Bach fugue, an
                        intricate symphony or a piece of chamber-music? Do we professional
                        musicians appreciate the technique of a wonderful piece of sculpture, of
                        an equally wonderful feat of engineering or even of a miraculous
                        surgical operation? It may be argued that an analogy between sculpture,
                        engineering, surgery and music is absurd, because the three former do
                        not appeal to the masses in the same manner as music does. Precisely: it
                        is because of this universal appeal on the part of music that the public
                        should be educated to _listen_ to _good_ music; that they should be
                        given, in a general way, a chance to acquaint themselves with the laws
                        underlying the \x22Beautiful in Music\x22 and should be shown the demands
                        which a right appreciation of the Art makes upon the Intellect and the
                        Emotions."

                        the help of a friend who advanced funds, the mass was performed at
                        Saint Roch, and was well spoken of by the press.
                        He now began to express himself not only in song but in orchestral
                        music. His first effort was the beautiful B flat major Symphony,
                        which, with the songs of that time seems to embody all the happiness
                        he enjoyed in winning his Clara. She proved a most admirable helpmate,
                        trying to shield him from interruptions and annoyance of every sort,
                        so he should have his time undisturbed for his work. Thus many of
                        his best compositions came into being in the early years of wedded
                        happiness."

  communication_note: "But the breach, which had started some years before, between Mme. Sand
                        and Chopin, widened as time passed, and they parted in 1847. It was
                        the inevitable, of course. Chopin never had much to say about it; Sand
                        said more, while the students asserted she had killed their beloved
                        master. Probably it all helped to undermine the masters feeble
                        health. His father passed away in 1844, his sister also, of pulmonary
                        trouble; he was lonely and ill himself. He gave his last concert in
                        Paris, February 16, 1848. Though weak he played beautifully. Some one
                        said he fainted in the artists room. The loss of Sand, even though he
                        had long wearied of her was the last drop.
                        From these stories there emerged a demoniacal little man with the
                        tantrums of a dozen prima donnas, a temperamental tyrant who, at
                        the dropping of a stitch in the orchestral knitting, tore his hair,
                        screamed at the top of his inexhaustible Latin lungs, doused his
                        trembling players with streams of blistering invective.
                        Franz was an open minded, frank, truth-loving child, always ready
                        to confess his faults, though he seemed to have but few. Strangely
                        enough, though born an Hungarian, he was never taught to speak his
                        native tongue, which indeed was only used by the peasants. German, the
                        polite language of the country, was alone used in the Liszt home.
                        Perhaps no man ever led a more crowded life, though outwardly a quiet
                        one. He never had an idle moment. When not playing, composing or
                        teaching, he would be found engraving music on copper, since that work
                        was costly in those days. Or he would be manufacturing some kind of
                        musical instrument. At least two are known to be of his invention."

  communication_note: "Hardly had he left the school when he was drafted for the army. This
                        meant several years of virtual captivity, for conscription could not
                        be avoided. The only other thing he could do was to return home and
                        become a teacher in his fathers school. He chose the lesser evil and
                        qualified at once to become his fathers assistant, which would also
                        assure him a certain amount of leisure. We can imagine him installed
                        as teacher of the infant class, and realize how distasteful was the
                        daily round of school work, and how he longed to have it over, that he
                        might put on paper all the lovely themes that had come to him through
                        the school day. Other bright spots were the happy hours he spent with
                        the Grob family, who lived also in the district of Lichtenthal.
                        The family consisted of a mother, a son and daughter. They were all
                        musical. Therese Grob had a fine voice and she enjoyed the songs
                        Schubert brought her to sing, while her brother Heinrich could play
                        both piano and cello. Many evenings filled with music were passed by
                        the young people. His friends at the Convict too, welcomed each new
                        piece he wrote. Nor did he forget his old master Holzer, the organist
                        of the little church where the composer himself regularly attended.
                        During 1814, Schubert composed his first mass, which was performed
                        October 16. It excited so much interest that it was repeated ten days
                        later at the Augustine church. Franz conducted, the choir was led
                        by Holzer, Ferdinand sat at the organ, and Therese sang the soprano
                        solos. In the audience sat old Salieri, Court Capellmeister of Vienna,
                        with whom Beethoven had studied. Salieri praised Schubert for his
                        work, and said that he should become his pupil. He kept his word and
                        gave the young composer daily lessons for some time. The father was
                        so proud and happy that he bought a five octave piano for his boy, to
                        celebrate the event."

                        shall deal with more fully in another essay at the end of this book: it
                        is the decline of musical taste in France--and, I rather think, in all
                        Europe--since 1835 or 1840. Berlioz says in his _Memoires_: \x22Since the
                        first performance of _Romeo et Juliette_ the indifference of the French
                        public for all that concerns art and literature has grown incredibly\x22
                        (_Memoires_, II, 263). Compare the shouts of excitement and the tears
                        that were drawn from the dilettanti of 1830 (_Memoires_, I, 81), at the
                        performances of Italian operas or Glucks works, with the coldness of
                        the public between 1840 and 1870. A mantle of ice covered art then. How
                        much Berlioz must have suffered. In Germany the great romantic age was
                        dead. Only Wagner remained to give life to music; and he drained all
                        that was left in Europe of love and enthusiasm for music. Berlioz died
                        truly of asphyxia.]
                        What was to be done? His family was ruined, for a fire had demolished
                        their little possessions. He felt the silent reproaches of his father
                        already weighing upon him--for he loved his father dearly, and
                        remembered the sacrifices he had made for him. He did not wish to return
                        to his own province; indeed he could not return--that would have been
                        death. It was necessary that this boy of seventeen should find some
                        means of earning a livelihood and be able to instruct himself at the
                        same time. After his expulsion from the Conservatoire he attended no
                        other school; he taught himself. And he taught himself wonderfully; but
                        at what a cost! The suffering he went through from that time until he
                        was thirty, the enormous amount of energy he had to expend in order to
                        live and cultivate the fine spirit of poetry that was within him--all
                        this effort and toil was, without doubt, the cause of his unhappy death.
                        He had a burning thirst for knowledge and a fever for work which made
                        him sometimes forget the necessity for eating and drinking.
                        Wagner remained in this place about two years and finished his opera
                        there. The performance of it, for which he labored with great zeal,
                        was a fiasco. The theater, too, failed soon after and the young
                        composer was thrown out of work. His sojourn there influenced his
                        after career, as he met Wilhelmina Planer, who was soon to become his
                        wife.
                        [Footnote 220: My statements may be verified by the account published in
                        the _Revue Eolienne_ of January, 1902, by M. Leon Bourgeois, secretary
                        of the Committee of the _Association des Concerts-Lamoureux_.]"

  communication_note: "The strain of the production of \x22Euryanthe\x22 told severely on the
                        composers delicate health, and he returned to Dresden in an exhausted
                        state. There was no rest for him here, as official duties were
                        pressing. The malady afflicting his lungs had made rapid progress and
                        he began to fear he should not be long spared to his wife and little
                        ones.
                        The new Conservatoire of Music was founded at St. Petersburg in 1862,
                        with Anton Rubinstein as director, and Tschaikowsky lost no time in
                        entering as a pupil, studying composition and kindred subjects with
                        Professor Zaremba. His progress was so rapid in the several branches
                        he took up--piano, organ and flute--that Rubinstein advised him to
                        make music his profession, and throw his law studies to the winds.
                        Thanks to Rubinstein, he secured some pupils and also engagements as
                        accompanist. Meanwhile he worked industriously at composition, and one
                        of his pieces was a Concert Overture in F, scored for small orchestra.
                        In 1865 he took his diploma as a musician and also secured a silver
                        medal for a cantata. One year after this the Moscow Conservatoire
                        was founded, with Nicholas Rubinstein at its head. The position
                        of Professor of Composition and Musical History was offered to
                        Tschaikowsky, then only twenty-six. It was a flattering offer for so
                        young a man, when many older heads would have liked to secure such
                        an honor. He moved to Moscow, and retained his position in the
                        Conservatoire for at least twelve years, in the meantime making many
                        friends for himself and his art, as his fame as a composer grew. One
                        of these friends was the publisher Jurgenson, who was to play rather
                        an important part in the composers life, through accepting and
                        putting forth his compositions.
                        But what joy there is when these deeds of faith have been
                        performed--when Jesus has cured the possessed man, or when Lazarus has
                        opened his eyes to the light. The heart of the multitude overflows
                        perhaps in rather childish thanksgiving; and at first it seemed to me
                        expressed in a commonplace way. But did not the joy of all great artists
                        so express itself?--the joy of Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach, who, when
                        once they had thrown their cares aside, knew how to amuse themselves
                        like the rest of the populace. And the simple phrase at the beginning
                        soon assumes fuller proportions, the harmonies gain in richness, a
                        glowing ardour fills the music, and a chorale blends with the dances in
                        triumphant majesty.
                        We must consider a little this singular book, where a living science and
                        a Gothic spirit are closely intermingled (I use the word \x22Gothic\x22 in its
                        best sense; I know it is the highest praise one can give M. dIndy).
                        This work has not received the attention it deserves. It is a record of
                        the spirit of contemporary art; and if it stands rather apart from other
                        writings, it should not be allowed to pass unnoticed on that account."

  communication_note: "Johann had been doing some piano teaching when not occupied with
                        composition. But now, on the advice of his musical friends, he decided
                        to try his luck again as a concert pianist. He began by joining Frau
                        Clara and Joachim in a concert at Danzig. Each played solos. Johanns
                        were Bachs \x22Chromatic Fantaisie\x22 and several manuscript pieces of
                        his own. After this the young artist went his own way. He played with
                        success in Bremen, also in Hamburg. It is said he was always nervous
                        before playing, but especially so in his home city. However all passed
                        off well. He now settled definitely in Hamburg, making musical trips
                        to other places when necessary.

                        He early gave proofs of his talents. Before he was eight years old
                        he played at a large evening company, with such surprising cleverness
                        that it was predicted he would become another Mozart. The next year he
                        was invited to take part in a large concert given under distinguished
                        patronage. The boy was a simple, modest child, and played the piano as
                        the bird sings, with unconscious art. When he returned home after this
                        concert, his mother asked: \x22What did the people like best?\x22 and he
                        answered naevely: \x22Oh, mama, every one was looking at my collar.\x22
                        He was born at Kalischt in Bohemia, and became a pupil of Anton
                        Bruckner at Vienna, and afterwards _Hofoperndirecktor_ (\x22Director of the
                        Opera\x22) there. I hope one day to study this artists work in greater
                        detail, for he is second only to Strauss as a composer in Germany, and
                        the principal musician of South Germany."

                        countries. He had long wished to visit England, and the present seemed
                        a favorable time, as his friends there assured him of a warm
                        welcome. The pleasure he felt on reaching London was increased by the
                        enthusiastic greeting he received at the hands of the musical public.

                        was so vigorously applauded that I had to repeat it. After the Finale
                        there was lots more applause, while I was thanking the orchestra and
                        shaking hands, till I left the room.\x22"

  communication_note: "\x22If I begin this bit, I shall have to write the whole symphony. It
                        will be a big thing, and I shall have to spend three or four months
                        over it. That means I shall write no more articles and earn no
                        money. And when the symphony is finished I shall not be able to
                        resist the temptation of having it copied (which will mean an
                        expense of a thousand or twelve hundred francs), and then of having
                        it played. I shall give a concert, and the receipts will barely
                        cover half the cost. I shall lose what I have not got; the poor
                        invalid will lack necessities; and I shall be able to pay neither
                        my personal expenses nor my sons fees when he goes on board
                        ship.... These thoughts made me shudder, and I threw down my pen,
                        saying, Bah! to-morrow I shall have forgotten the symphony. The
                        next night I heard the allegro clearly, and seemed to see it
                        written down. I was filled with feverish agitation; I sang the
                        theme; I was going to get up ... but the reflections of the day
                        before restrained me; I steeled myself against the temptation, and
                        clung to the thought of forgetting it. At last I went to sleep; and
                        the next day, on waking, all remembrance of it had, indeed, gone
                        for ever.\x22[23]"

  communication_note: "Who does not know his passion for Henrietta Smithson? It was a sad
                        story. He fell in love with an English actress who played Juliet (Was it
                        she or Juliet whom he loved?). He caught but a glance of her, and it was
                        all over with him. He cried out, \x22Ah, I am lost!\x22 He desired her; she
                        repulsed him. He lived in a delirium of suffering and passion; he
                        wandered about for days and nights like a madman, up and down Paris and
                        its neighbourhood, without purpose or rest or relief, until sleep
                        overcame him wherever it found him--among the sheaves in a field near
                        Villejuif, in a meadow near Sceaux, on the bank of the frozen Seine near
                        Neuilly, in the snow, and once on a table in the Cafe Cardinal, where he
                        slept for five hours, to the great alarm of the waiters, who thought he
                        was dead.[17] Meanwhile, he was told slanderous gossip about Henrietta,
                        which he readily believed. Then he despised her, and dishonoured her
                        publicly in his _Symphonie fantastique_, paying homage in his bitter
                        resentment to Camille Moke, a pianist, to whom he lost his heart without
                        delay.
                        But I must stop. I have said enough to show the fun the author is
                        indulging in. When one hears the work one cannot help admiring the
                        composers technical knowledge, skill in orchestration, and sense of
                        humour. And one is all the more surprised that he confines himself to
                        the illustration of texts[178] when he is so capable of creating comic
                        and dramatic matter without it. Although _Don Quixote_ is a marvel of
                        skill and a very wonderful work, in which Strauss has developed a
                        suppler and richer style, it marks, to my mind, a progress in his
                        technique and a backward step in his mind, for he seems to have adopted
                        the decadent conceptions of an art suited to playthings and trinkets to
                        please a frivolous and affected society.
                        Wagner, at the same age, a victor, worshipped, flattered, and--if we are
                        to believe the Bayreuth legend--crowned with prosperity; Wagner, sad and
                        suffering, doubting his achievements, feeling the inanity of his bitter
                        fight against the mediocrity of the world, had \x22fled far from the
                        world\x22[49] and thrown himself into religion; and when a friend looked at
                        him in surprise as he was saying grace at table, he answered: \x22Yes, I
                        believe in my Saviour.\x22[50]
                        On returning to Paris, he had much domestic trouble to bear. His wife
                        was paralyzed and his only son, Louis, wished to leave home and become
                        a sailor--which he did eventually, though much against the wishes of
                        his parents."

  communication_note: "But this is not all. What was the bitterness of failure compared with
                        the great anguish of death? Berlioz saw all those he loved die one after
                        the other: his father, his mother, Henrietta Smithson, Marie Recio. Then
                        only his son Louis remained.
                        Giuseppe, though working hard in the warehouse, also found time to
                        attend all the rehearsals of the Philharmonics, and began the task
                        of copying out separate parts from the score. His earnestness in this
                        work attracted the notice of the conductor, Ferdinando Provesi, who
                        began to take great interest in the boy, and was the first one to
                        understand his talent and advised him to devote himself to music. A
                        Canon in the Cathedral offered to teach him Latin, and tried to make a
                        priest of him, saying, \x22What do you want to study music for? You
                        have a gift for Latin and it would be much better for you to become a
                        priest. What do you expect from your music? Do you think that some
                        day you will become organist of Busseto? Stuff and nonsense! That can
                        never be.\x22
                        As for Debussys harmonic language, his originality does not consist, as
                        some of his foolish admirers have said, in the invention of new chords,
                        but in the new use he makes of them. A man is not a great artist because
                        he makes use of unresolved sevenths and ninths, consecutive major thirds
                        and ninths, and harmonic progressions based on a scale of whole tones;
                        one is only an artist when one makes them say something. And it is not
                        on account of the peculiarities of Debussys style--of which one may
                        find isolated examples in great composers before him, in Chopin, Liszt,
                        Chabrier, and Richard Strauss--but because with Debussy these
                        peculiarities are an expression of his personality, and because _Pelleas
                        et Melisande_, \x22the land of ninths,\x22 has a poetic atmosphere which is
                        like no other musical drama ever written."

                        surprising, since he was not allowed to run afield with other

                        slow by his impatient father, he was treated to raps and blows by way
                        of incentive to work yet harder. His teachers, too, were continually

                        After awhile he was taken in hand by Michael Haydn, a brother of the

                        Wagner returned to Leipsic in 1834. Soon there came another impetus
                        to this budding genius: he heard for the first time the great singer
                        Wilhelmina Schroeder-Devrient, whose art made a deep impression on
                        him."

                        1741. Towards the end of this year he was invited to visit Ireland
                        to make known some of his works. On the way there he was detained at
                        Chester for several days by contrary winds. He must have had the score
                        of the \x22Messiah\x22 with him, for he got together some choir boys to try
                        over a few of the choral parts. \x22Can you sing at sight?\x22 was put to
                        each boy before he was asked to sing. One broke down at the start.
                        \x22What de devil you mean!\x22 cried the impetuous composer, snatching the
                        music from him. \x22Didnt you say you could sing at sight?\x22
                        [Footnote 103: Letter to some young Hungarians, 14 February, 1861. See
                        the _Memoires_, II, 212, for the incredible emotion which the _Marche de
                        Rakoczy_ roused in the audience at Budapest, and, above all, for the
                        astonishing scene at the end:--
                        It was a tremendous undertaking, and though an artistic success, the
                        exertion nearly finished Berlioz, who was sent south by his physician.
                        Resting on the shores of the Mediterranean, he afterwards gave
                        concerts in Marseilles, Lyons, and Lille and then traveled to Vienna.
                        He writes of this visit:
                        The Boston music lovers didnt like it. To them the Symphony is a
                        sacred cow and they regarded the older members in the light of
                        special pets. But when, at the opening of the new season, they heard
                        a brilliant, completely rejuvenated orchestra, they forgave the new
                        conductor. Since then, he has restored the Symphony to its old-time
                        glory. Today Beacon Hill has no greater favorite than Serge
                        Alexandrovitch Koussevitzky."

                        requested that one of his operas should be produced, promising carte
                        blanche for funds. All might have gone well with music of the accepted
                        pattern. But \x22Tannheuser\x22 was different, its composer particular as to
                        who sang and how it was done. The rehearsals went badly, an opposing
                        faction tried to drown the music at the first performance. Matters
                        were so much worse at the second performance that Wagner refused to
                        allow it to proceed. In spite of the Emperors promises, he had borne
                        much of the expense, and left Paris in disgust, burdened with debt."

                        Lavigna was a former pupil of the Conservatoire of Naples and an able
                        composer. Verdi showed him some of the same compositions he had shown
                        Basili. After examining them he willingly accepted the young aspirant
                        as a pupil.
                        One morning his cousin told him there would be a procession through
                        the town in honor of a prominent citizen who had just passed away. A
                        drummer was needed and the cousin had proposed Josef. He showed the
                        boy how to make the strokes for a march, with the result that Josef
                        walked in the procession and felt quite proud of this exhibition of
                        his skill. The very drum he used that day is preserved in the little
                        church at Hamburg.
                        The young enthusiast began life anew in Paris, by being very
                        economical, as he must pay back the loan made for his mass. He found
                        a tiny fifth floor room, gave up restaurant dinners and contented
                        himself with plain bread, with the addition of raisins, prunes
                        or dates. He also secured some pupils, which helped out in this
                        emergency, and even got a chance to sing in vaudeville, at the
                        enormous sum of 50 francs per month!"

                        between nations, races, and states, who are strangers to one
                        another in many ways; she may unite what is disunited, and bring
                        peace to what is hostile.... No country is more suited for her
                        friendly aid than Alsace-Lorraine, that old meeting-place of
                        people, where from time immemorial the North and South have
                        exchanged their material and their spiritual wealth; and no place
                        is readier to welcome her than Strasburg, an old town built by the
                        Romans, which has remained to this day a centre of spiritual life.
                        All great intellectual currents have left their mark on the people
                        of Alsace-Lorraine; and so they have been destined to play the part
                        of mediator between different times and different peoples; and the
                        East and the West, the past and the present, meet here and join
                        hands. In such festivals as this, it is not a matter of gaining
                        aesthetic victories; it is a matter of bringing together all that
                        is great and noble and eternal in the art of different times and
                        different nations.\x22

                        dIndys spirit. With reference to this, I will dwell upon one point
                        only, since it is curious, and seems to me to be of general artistic
                        interest. M. dIndy writes his own poems for his \x22_actions
                        musicales_\x22--Wagners example, it seems, has been catching. We have seen
                        how the harmony of a work may suffer through the dual gifts of its
                        author; though he may have thought to perfect his composition by writing
                        both words and music. But an artists poetical and musical gifts are not
                        necessarily of the same order. A man has not always the same kind of
                        talent in other arts that he has in the art which he has made his own--I
                        am speaking not only of his technical skill, but of his temperament as
                        well. Delacroix was of the Romantic school in painting, but in
                        literature his style was Classic. We have all known artists who were
                        revolutionaries in their own sphere, but conservative and behind the
                        times in their opinions about other branches of art. The double gift of
                        poetry and music is in M. dIndy up to a certain point. But is his
                        reason always in agreement with his heart?[163]"

                        moonlight, because of his great love for it, another child of the same
                        age was finding the greatest happiness of his life seated before an
                        old spinet, standing in a lumber garret. He was trying to make music
                        from those half dumb keys. No one had taught him how to play; it was
                        innate genius that guided his little hands to find the right harmonies
                        and bring melody out of the old spinet.

                        He had to be very careful, gave fewer lessons during the season, and
                        spent his vacations at Nohant. He played rarely in public, though
                        there were two public concerts in 1841 and 42 at Pleyels rooms. From
                        1843 to 1847 he lived quietly and his life was apparently happy. He
                        was fond of the Sand children, and amused himself with them when at
                        Nohant.
                        The more one learns of the history of great artists, the more one is
                        struck by the immense amount of sadness their lives enclose. Not only
                        are they subjected to the trials and disappointments of ordinary
                        life--which affect them more cruelly through their greater
                        sensitiveness--but their surroundings are like a desert, because they
                        are twenty, thirty, fifty, or even hundreds of years in advance of their
                        contemporaries; and they are often condemned to despairing efforts, not
                        to conquer the world, but to live."

                        were stirring times in that part of the world, for revolution was
                        often on the eve of breaking out. The tiny babe was but six months
                        old when the father passed away. There were eight other children, the
                        eldest son being only fourteen. The mother, a sweet, gentle little
                        woman, found herself quite unable to support her large family of
                        growing children. No one could blame her for accepting the hand of her
                        husbands old friend, Ludwig Geyer, in less than a year after the
                        loss of her first husband. Geyer was a man of much artistic talent,
                        an actor, singer, author and painter. He thought little Richard might
                        become a portrait painter, or possibly a musician, since the child had
                        learned to play two little pieces on the piano.
                        The influence of the Conservatoire is, in music especially, an influence
                        of the past and of the Government. One may say much the same of the
                        Opera. This ancient association, which bears the imposing name of
                        _Academie nationale de Musique_ and dates from 1669, is a sort of
                        national institution which is more concerned with the history of
                        official art than with living art. The satire with which Jean-Jacques
                        describes, in his _Nouvelle Heloise_, the stiff solemnity and mournful
                        pomp of its performances has not lost much of its truth. What is lacking
                        in the Opera to-day is the enthusiasm that accompanied its former
                        musical struggles in the times of the \x22_Encyclopedistes_\x22 and the
                        \x22_guerre des coins_.\x22 The great battles of art are now fought outside
                        its doors; and it has become by degrees a showy _salon_, a little faded
                        perhaps, where the public is more interested in itself than in the
                        performance. In spite of the enormous sums that it swallows up every
                        year (nearly four million francs),[213] only one or two new pieces are
                        produced in a year, and they are rarely works that are representative of
                        the modern school. And though it has at last admitted Wagners dramas
                        into its repertory, one can no longer consider these works, half a
                        century old, to be in the vanguard of music. The most esteemed masters
                        of the French school, such as Massenet, Reyer, Chausson, and Vincent
                        dIndy, had to seek refuge in the Theatre de la Monnaie at Brussels
                        before they could get their works received at the Opera in Paris. And
                        the classical composers fare no better. Neither _Fidelio_ nor Glucks
                        tragedies--with the exception of _Armide_, which was put on under
                        pressure of fashion--are represented; and when by chance they give
                        _Freischuetz_ or _Don Juan_, one wonders if it would not have been better
                        to let them rest in oblivion, rather than treat them sacrilegiously by
                        adding, cutting, introducing ballets and new recitatives, and deforming
                        their style so as to bring them \x22up to date.\x22[214]
                        Wagner left _Siegfried_ asleep in the forest in order to embark on the
                        funereal vessel of _Tristan und Isolde_. But he left Siegfried with some
                        anguish of heart. When writing to Liszt in 1857, he says:"

                        returning to his post. Of course there was trouble on his return, but
                        the authorities retained him in spite of all, for the esteem in which
                        they held his gifts.
                        The first lectures on Aesthetics and Musical History were not given in
                        France until after the war of 1870.[238] They were then given at the
                        Conservatoire, and, until quite lately, were the only lectures on Music
                        of any importance in Paris. Since 1878 they have been given in a very
                        excellent way by M. Bourgault-Ducoudray; but, as is only natural in a
                        school of music, their character is artistic rather than scientific, and
                        takes the form of a sort of illustration of the practical work that is
                        done at the Conservatoire. And as for Parisian musical criticism as a
                        whole, it had, thirty years ago, an almost exclusively literary
                        character, and was without technical precision or historical knowledge.
                        In a general way one may say that M. Maurice Buchors campaign has
                        especially succeeded in departments like that of Aisne and Drome, where
                        the ground has been prepared by the Academy Inspector. Unhappily in many
                        districts the movement receives a lively opposition from music-teachers,
                        who do not approve of this mnemotechnical way of learning poetry with
                        music, without any instruction in solfeggio or musical science. And it
                        is quite evident that this method would have its defects if it were a
                        question of training musicians. But it is really a matter of training
                        people who have some music in them; and so the musicians must not be too
                        fastidious. I hope that great musicians will one day spring from this
                        good ground--musicians more human than those of our own time, musicians
                        whose music will be rooted in their hearts and in their country.]"

  communication_note: "His passion for drawing was liable to break out at any moment. During
                        one of the lesson hours he was varying the monotony by drawing,
                        behind his book, a picture of his teacher, whose special facial
                        characteristic was a very large nose. Just as the sketch was finished
                        he was detected and was asked to show the result. The professor,
                        instead of being angry, considered it a remarkable likeness and asked
                        to keep it. Shortly after this the professor called on Mrs. MacDowell,
                        telling her he had shown the drawing to an eminent painter, also
                        an instructor at the ecole des Beaux Arts. The painter had been so
                        greatly impressed with the boys talent that he offered him a three
                        years course of free instruction, under his own supervision. He also
                        promised to be responsible for Edwards support during that time.
                        Among his fellow students at the Conservatory were at least a half
                        dozen who later made names for themselves. They were: Arthur Sullivan,
                        Walter Bache, Franklin Taylor, Edward Dannreuther and J.F. Barnett.
                        All these were making rapid progress in spite of dry methods. So
                        Edward Grieg began to realize that if he would also accomplish
                        anything, he must buckle down to work. He now began to study with
                        frantic ardor, with scarcely time left for eating and sleeping. The
                        result of this was a complete breakdown in the spring of 1860, with
                        several ailments, incipient lung trouble being the most serious.
                        Indeed it was serious enough to deprive Grieg of one lung, leaving him
                        for the remainder of his life somewhat delicate.
                        [Footnote 243: M. Maurice Buchor relates an anecdote which typifies what
                        I mean. \x22I begged the conductor of a good mens choral society,\x22 he
                        says, \x22to have one of Haendels choruses sung. But he seemed to hesitate.
                        I had made the suggestion tentatively, and then tried to enlarge on the
                        sincerity and breadth of its musical idea. Ah, very good, he said, if
                        you really want to hear it, it is easily done; but I was afraid that
                        perhaps it was rather too popular.\x22 (_Poeme de la Vie Humaine_:
                        Introduction to the Second Series, 1905.) One may add to this the words
                        of a professor of singing in a primary school for Higher Education in
                        Paris: \x22Folk-music--well, it is very good for the provinces.\x22 (Quoted by
                        Buchor in the Introduction to the Second Series of the _Poeme_, 1902.)]"

  communication_note: "I have tried to unearth M. dIndys strongest characteristics, and I
                        think I have found them in his faith and in his activity, I am only too
                        aware of the pitfalls that have beset me in this attempt; it is always
                        difficult to criticise a mans personality, and it is most difficult
                        when he is alive and still in the midst of his development. Every man is
                        a mystery, not only to others, but to himself. There is something very
                        presumptuous about pretending to know anyone who does not quite know
                        himself. And yet one cannot live without forming opinions; it is a
                        necessity of life. The people we see and know (or say we know), our
                        friends, and those we love, are never what we think them. Often they are
                        not at all like the portrait we conjure up; for we walk among the
                        phantoms of our hearts. But still one must go on having opinions, and go
                        on constructing and creating things, if we do not want to become
                        impotent through inertia. Error is better than doubt, provided we err in
                        good faith; and the main thing is to speak out the thing that one really
                        feels and believes. I hope M. dIndy will forgive me if I have gone far
                        wrong, and that he will see in these pages a sincere effort to
                        understand him and a keen sympathy with himself, and even with his
                        ideas, though I do not always share them. But I have always thought that
                        in life a mans opinions go for very little, and that the only thing
                        that matters is the man himself. Freedom of spirit is the greatest
                        happiness one can know; one must be sorry for those who have not got it.
                        And there is a secret pleasure in rendering homage to anothers splendid
                        creed, even though it is one that we do not ourselves profess."

  communication_note: "Ferdinand Hiller, composer, pianist and one of Hectors intimate
                        friends, fell deeply in love with Marie Moke, a beautiful, talented
                        girl who, later on, won considerable fame as a pianist. She became
                        interested in the young French composer, through hearing of his mental
                        suffering from Hiller. They were thrown together in a school where
                        both gave lessons, she on the piano and he on the--guitar! Meeting so
                        constantly, her dainty beauty won a warm place in the affections of
                        the impressionable Hector. She was but eighteen, while her admirer was
                        twenty-five.

                        Richard Strausss _Feuersnot_. There, too, the hero is a stranger who is
                        persecuted, and treated as a sorcerer in the very town to which he has
                        brought honour. But the _denouement_ is not the same; and the
                        fundamental difference of temperament between the two artists is
                        strongly marked. M. dIndy finishes with the renouncement of a
                        Christian, and Herr Richard Strauss by a proud and joyous affirmation of
                        independence.]

                        In March, 1895, Wolf lived once more, and in three months had written
                        the piano score of _Corregidor_. For many years he had been attracted
                        towards the stage, and especially towards light opera. Enthusiast though
                        he was for Wagners work, he had declared openly that it was time for
                        musicians to free themselves from the Wagnerian _Musik-Drama_. He knew
                        his own gifts, and did not aspire to take Wagners place. When one of
                        his friends offered him a subject for an opera, taken from a legend
                        about Buddha, he declined it, saying that the world did not yet
                        understand the meaning of Buddhas doctrines, and that he had no wish to
                        give humanity a fresh headache. In a letter to Grohe, on 28 June, 1890,
                        he says:"

  communication_note: "Of the composers two brothers, one had passed away and had left his
                        boy Carl, named after himself, as a solemn charge, to be brought up by
                        Uncle Ludwig as his own son. The composer took up this task generously
                        and unselfishly. He was happy to have the little lad near him, one of
                        his own kin to love. But as Carl grew to young manhood he proved to
                        be utterly unworthy of all this affection. He treated his good uncle
                        shamefully, stole money from him, though he had been always generously
                        supplied with it, and became a disgrace to the family. There is no
                        doubt that his nephews dissolute habits saddened the masters life,
                        estranged him from his friends and hastened his death.
                        He was taken to Dr. Svetlins private hospital in Vienna, and remained
                        there until January, 1898. Happily he had devoted friends who took care
                        of him and made up for the indifference of the public; for what he had
                        earned himself would not have enabled him even to die in peace. When
                        Schott, the publisher, sent him in October, 1895, his royalties for the
                        editions of his _Lieder_ of Moerike, Goethe, Eichendorff, Keller, Spanish
                        poetry, and the first volume of Italian poetry, their total for five
                        years came to eighty-six marks and thirty-five pfennigs! And Schott
                        calmly added that he had not expected so good a result. So it was Wolfs
                        friends, and especially Hugo Faisst, who not only saved him from misery
                        by their unobtrusive and often secret generosity, but spared him the
                        horror of destitution in his last misfortunes."

                        romance; and we have to see in the music, as we do in little Flemish and
                        Dutch pictures, not only Don Quixotes features, but the words of the
                        books he reads. Sometimes it is the story of a knight who is righting a
                        giant, sometimes the adventures of a knight-errant who has dedicated
                        himself to the services of a lady, sometimes it is a nobleman who has
                        given his life in fulfilment of a vow to atone for his sins. Don
                        Quixotes mind becomes confused (and our own with it) over all these
                        stories; he is quite distracted. He leaves home in company with his
                        squire. The two figures are drawn with great spirit; the one is an old
                        Spaniard, stiff, languishing, distrustful, a bit of a poet, rather
                        undecided in his opinions but obstinate when his mind is once made up;

                        himself in a waggish way and quoting droll proverbs--translated in the
                        music by short-winded phrases that always return to the point they
                        started from. The adventures begin. Here are the windmills (trills from
                        the violins and wood wind), and the bleating army of the grand emperor,
                        Alifanfaron (tremolos from the wood wind); and here, in the third
                        variation, is a dialogue between the knight and his squire, from which
                        we are to guess that Sancho questions his master on the advantages of a
                        chivalrous life, for they seem to him doubtful. Don Quixote talks to him
                        of glory and honour; but Sancho has no thought for it. In reply to these
                        grand words he urges the superiority of sure profits, fat meals, and
                        sounding money. Then the adventures begin again. The two companions fly
                        through the air on wooden horses; and the illusion of this giddy voyage
                        is given by chromatic passages on the flutes, harps, kettledrums, and a
                        \x22windmachine,\x22 while \x22the tremolo of the double basses on the key-note
                        shows that the horses have never left the earth.\x22[177]
                        The next winter was spent in Frankfort, instructing a few private
                        pupils, but mostly in composing, with much reading of the literature
                        of various countries, and, in the spring, with long walks in the
                        beautiful woods about Frankfort. Wiesbaden became their home during
                        the winter of 1885-6. The same year saw the completion of the second.

                        The lesson began, and the little girl showed both quickness and
                        patience to grasp the ideas. No one at first noticed the tiny child
                        who planted himself at his sisters elbow, the light of the candles
                        falling on his delicate, sensitive features and bright brown hair. His
                        glance never left Nannerls fingers as they felt hesitatingly
                        among the white and black keys, while his ear easily understood the
                        intervals she tried to play."

  communication_note: "Above Meylan, in a crevice of the mountain, stood a white house amid
                        its vineyards and gardens. It was the home of Mme. Gautier and her two
                        nieces, of whom the younger was called Estelle. When the boy Hector
                        saw her for the first time, he was twelve, a shy, retiring little
                        fellow. Estelle was just eighteen, tall, graceful, with beautiful
                        dusky hair and large soulful eyes. Most wonderful of all, with her
                        simple white gown, she wore pink slippers. The shy boy of twelve fell
                        in desperate love with this white robed apparition in pink slippers.
                        He says himself:
                        The dramatic tendency of these oratorios is very marked, and it is
                        chiefly on that account that they have conquered Italy. In spite of some
                        passages which have strayed a little in the direction of opera, or even
                        melodrama, the music shows great depth of feeling. The figures of the
                        women especially are drawn with delicacy; and in the second part of
                        _Lazarus_, Marys air, \x22Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had
                        not died,\x22 recalls something of Glucks _Orfeo_ in its heart-broken
                        sadness. And again, in the same oratorio, when Jesus gives the order to
                        raise the stone from the tomb, Marthas speech, \x22Domine, jam foetet,\x22 is
                        very expressive of her sadness, fear, and shame, and human horror. I
                        should like to quote one more passage, the most moving of all, which is
                        found in the _Resurrection of Christ_, when Mary Magdalene is beside the
                        tomb of Christ; here, in her speech with the angels, in her touching
                        lamentation, and in the words of the Evangelist, \x22And when she had thus
                        said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that
                        it was Jesus,\x22 we hear a melody filled with tenderness, and seem to see
                        Christs eyes shining as they rest on Mary before she has recognised
                        Him.
                        We have sketched the childhood and youth of this wonderful artist up
                        to this point. We will pass lightly over this decade of his career,
                        merely stating briefly that the lady--the beautiful Countess dAgoult,
                        captivated by the brilliant talents of the Hungarian virtuoso, left
                        her husband and child, and became for ten years the faithful companion
                        of his travels and tours over Europe. Many writers agree that Liszt
                        endeavored to dissuade her from this attraction, and behaved as
                        honorably as he could under the circumstances. A part of the time
                        they lived in Switzerland, and it was there that many of Liszts
                        compositions were written.
                        These hurricanes are let loose in order to speak to the people, to stir
                        and rouse the dull ocean of humanity. The _Requiem_ is a Last Judgment,
                        not meant, like that of the Sixtine Chapel (which Berlioz did not care
                        for at all) for great aristocracies, but for a crowd, a surging,
                        excited, and rather savage crowd. The _Marche de Rakoczy_ is less an
                        Hungarian march than the music for a revolutionary fight; it sounds the
                        charge; and Berlioz tells us it might bear Virgils verses for a
                        motto:--"

  communication_note: "The father happened to take his boy with him to Carlsbad in the summer
                        of 1819, and here he heard for the first time a great pianist, Ignatz
                        Moscheles. His masterful playing made a great impression on the nine
                        year old enthusiast, who began now to wish to become a musician, and
                        applied himself to music with redoubled zeal. He also made such
                        good progress at school that at Easter 1820 he was able to enter the
                        Zwickau Academy.
                        At the next matinee the Academy of Music was black as a crypt. On
                        the stage, at each of the players desks, hung a small, green-shaded
                        light. Then Mr. Stokowski walked out on the podium. The moment he had
                        mounted the dais, a spotlight was trained on his head, turning his
                        hair into a glittering golden halo. The ladies forgot all about their
                        friends dresses. Why, the darling boy looked like an angel descended
                        into a tomb to waken the dead!
                        Leopold Mozarts first care on reaching the great English metropolis
                        was to obtain an introduction at Court. King George III and the Queen
                        were very fond of music, and it was not long before an invitation came
                        for the children to attend at the Palace. The King showed the greatest
                        interest in Wolfgang, asking him to play at sight difficult pieces by
                        Bach and Handel. Then the boy, after accompanying the Queen in a song,
                        selected the bass part in a piece by Handel, and improvised a charming
                        melody to it. The King was so impressed that he wished him to play the
                        organ, in the playing of which Wolfgang won a further triumph.
                        Brahms read Wolfs articles, but his attacks did not seem to stir his
                        apathy. The \x22Brahmines,\x22 however, never forgave Wolf. One of his
                        bitterest enemies was Hans von Buelow, who found anti-Brahmism \x22the
                        blasphemy against the Holy Ghost--which shall not be forgiven.\x22[185]
                        Some years later, when Wolf succeeded in getting his own compositions
                        played, he had to submit to criticisms like that of Max Kalbeck, one of
                        the leaders of \x22Brahmism\x22 at Vienna:"

  communication_note: "I will not prolong a discussion where so many things must be left
                        unsaid. But I would suggest that, once and for all, we get rid of these
                        absurd endeavours to fence in art. Do not let us say: Music can....
                        Music cannot express such-and-such a thing. Let us say rather, If genius
                        pleases, everything is possible; and if music so wishes, she may be
                        painting and poetry to-morrow. Berlioz has proved it well in his
                        _Romeo_.
                        Schubert added many compositions to his list this year, among them
                        seventeen songs, including \x22Gretchen at the Spinning Wheel.\x22 His
                        acquaintance with the poet Johann Mayrhofer, with whom he soon became
                        intimate, was of benefit to both. The poet produced verses that
                        his friend might set to music. The following year, 1815, he wrote a
                        hundred and thirty-seven songs, to say nothing of six operas, and much
                        music for church and piano. Twenty-nine of these songs were written
                        in the month of August. One day in August eight songs were created; on
                        another day seven. Some of the songs were quite long, making between
                        twenty and thirty pages when printed.
                        Such independence is rare at any time; but it is very rare in our day,
                        when the power of public opinion is tyrannical; and it is rarest of all
                        in France, where artists are perhaps more sociable than in other
                        countries. Of all qualities in an artist it is the most precious; for it
                        forms the foundation of his character, and is the guarantee of his
                        conscience and innate strength. So we must not hide it under a bushel."

  communication_note: "Little Sebastian suffered in silence from this coldness. Fortunately
                        the force of his genius was too great to be crushed. He knew all the
                        simple pieces by heart, which his brother set for his lessons, and
                        he longed for bigger things. There was a book of manuscript music
                        containing pieces by Buxtehude and Frohberger, famous masters of the
                        time, in the possession of Christoph. Sebastian greatly desired to
                        play the pieces in that book, but his brother kept it under lock and
                        key in his cupboard, or bookcase. One day the child mustered courage
                        to ask permission to take the book for a little while. Instead of
                        yielding to the boys request Christoph became angry, told him not to
                        imagine he could study such masters as Buxtehude and Frohberger, but
                        should be content to get the lessons assigned him.
                        After visiting numerous German cities, Switzerland was reached and
                        its wonderful scenery stirred Mendelssohns poetic soul to the depths.
                        Yet, though his passionate love of nature was so impressed by the
                        great mountains, forests and waterfalls, it was the sea which he loved
                        best of all. As he approached Naples, and saw the sea sparkling in
                        the sun lighted bay, he exclaimed: \x22To me it is the finest object in
                        nature! I love it almost more than the sky. I always feel happy when
                        I see before me the wide expanse of water.\x22 Rome, of course, was a
                        center of fascination. Every day he picked out some special object
                        of interest to visit, which made that particular day one never to
                        be forgotten. The tour lasted until the spring of 1832, before
                        Mendelssohn returned to his home in Berlin, only to leave it shortly
                        afterwards to return to London. This great city, in spite of its fogs,
                        noises and turmoil, appealed to him more than the sunshine of Naples,
                        the fascination of Florence or the beauty of Rome.
                        Haydn was blissfully happy over the realization of his highest hopes.
                        In his wildest dreams he had never imagined such magnificence as he
                        found at the palace of Eisenstadt. The great buildings, troops of
                        servants, the wonderful parks and gardens, with their flowers, lakes
                        and fountains almost made him believe he was in fairyland. Of course
                        there would be some hard work, though it would not seem hard amid such
                        fascinating surroundings and there would be plenty of leisure for his
                        own creative activities. Best of all his wife could not be with him.
                        Have we now come to the end of our difficulties? Not yet; for Berlioz is
                        the most illusive of men, and no one has helped more than he to mislead
                        people in their estimate of him. We know how much he has written about
                        music and about his own life, and what wit and understanding he shows in
                        his shrewd criticisms and charming _Memoires_.[3]"

  communication_note: "The true founder of chamber-music concerts in Paris was M. Emile
                        Lemoine, who started the society called _La Trompette_. He has given us
                        a history of his work in the _Revue Musicale_ (15 October, 1903). He was
                        an engineer at the Ecole Poly-technique; and after he had left school he
                        formed, about 1860, a quartette society of earnest amateurs, though they
                        were not very skilled performers. This little society continued to meet
                        regularly, and after perfecting itself little by little, finally opened
                        its doors to the general public, which attended the concerts in
                        gradually increasing numbers. Then _La Trompette_ came into being. It
                        prospered from the day that M. Saint-Saens--who was at that time a young
                        man--made its acquaintance. He was pleased with these gatherings, and
                        became an intimate friend of Lemoine; and he interested himself in the
                        society, and induced other celebrated artists to take an interest in it,
                        too. Among its early friends were MM. Alphonse Duvernoy, Diemer, Pugno,
                        Delsart, Breitner, Delaborde, Ch. de Beriot, Fissot, Marsick, Loeb,
                        Remy, and Holmann. With such patronage, _La Trompette_ soon acquired
                        fame in the musical world, and \x22it represented in classical
                        chamber-music the semi-official part played by the _Societe des Concerts
                        du Conservatoire_ in classical orchestral music. Rubinstein, Paderewski,
                        Eugene dAlbert, Hans von Buelow, Arthur de Greef, Mme. Essipoff, and
                        Mme. Menter, never missed getting a hearing there when their tours led
                        them to Paris; and to figure on the programme of _La Trompette_ was like
                        the consecration of an artist.\x22 Such a society naturally contributed a
                        great deal to the spread of classical chamber-music in Paris. M. Lemoine

  communication_note: "The Kings birthday was to be celebrated on June 4 and London was
                        crowded with people from all parts of the country. Leopold Mozart had
                        chosen June 5 as the date for his first public concert. The hall was
                        filled to overflowing; one hundred guineas being taken in. Many of the
                        assisting performers would take no fee for their services, which added
                        to the fathers gratitude and happiness.
                        The characters of Tristan and Iseult are primarily taken from a French
                        legend. Debussy felt the story was a French heritage and should be
                        restored to its original atmosphere and idea. This it was his ardent
                        desire to accomplish.
                        As Debussys art only attempts to give the impression of the moment,
                        without troubling itself with what may come after, it is free from care,
                        and takes its fill in the enjoyment of the moment. In the garden of
                        harmonies it selects the most beautiful flowers; for sincerity of
                        expression takes a second place with it, and its first idea is to
                        please. In this again it interprets the aesthetic sensualism of the
                        French race, which seeks pleasure in art, and does not willingly admit
                        ugliness, even when it seems to be justified by the needs of the drama
                        and of truth. Mozart shared the same thought: \x22Music,\x22 he said, \x22even in
                        the most terrible situations, ought never to offend the ear; it should
                        charm it even there; and, in short, always remain music.\x22
                        \x22No, you are not. You are speaking of the old Mme. Berlioz, the one who
                        was abandoned; I am speaking of the young and pretty and loved one.
                        Well, that is myself!"

  communication_note: "When at last the book was in his hands, he clasped it to his breast
                        and hurried quickly back to his chamber. Placing the book on a table
                        in front of the window, where the moonlight fell full upon it, he took
                        pen and music paper and began copying out the pieces in the book.
                        This was but the beginning of nights of endless toil. For six months
                        whenever there were moonlight nights, Sebastian was at the window
                        working at his task with passionate eagerness.
                        In 1866, the feeling against Wagner had somewhat declined and the King
                        decided to have model performances of \x22Tannheuser\x22 and \x22Lohengrin\x22
                        at Munich. The Festival began June 11, 1867. The following year \x22Die
                        Meistersinger\x22 was performed--June 21, 1868.
                        One fine morning in October, 1808, Franz in his homespun grey suit,
                        spectacles shielding his bright, near-sighted eyes, his bushy
                        black hair covered by an old fashioned hat, presented himself for
                        examination by the Court Capellmeister and the singing master. The
                        other boys jeered at his odd appearance, but he kept his good humor.
                        When his turn came to sing, after solving all the problems given, his
                        singing of the trial pieces was so astonishing that he was passed in
                        at once, and ordered to put on the uniform of the imperial choristers."

                        first concert, with the Helmesberger Quartet, and before a crowded
                        house. It was a real success for \x22Schumanns young prophet.\x22 Although
                        concert giving was distasteful, he appeared again on December 20, and
                        then gave a second concert on January 6, 1863, when he played Bachs
                        Chromatic Fantaisie, Beethovens Variations in C minor, his own Sonata
                        Op. 5, and Schumanns Sonata OP. 11.
                        The next January Berlioz went home to his family, who were now
                        reconciled to his choice of music as a profession, and deluged him
                        with compliments, caresses and tender solicitude. The parents had

                        of the day. He had developed so quickly and was so precocious that

  communication_note: "Mozart had now decided to make a home for himself, and chose as his
                        bride Constanza Weber, a younger sister of Aloysia, his first love. In
                        spite of Leopold Mozarts remonstrance, the young people were married
                        August 16, 1782.
                        Meanwhile--and please dont lose sight of this cardinal fact--he made
                        transcendently beautiful music. His stature as a conductor grew
                        with the years and so did the repertoire of scores he conducted from
                        memory. This feat involved heartbreaking work, for his memory, while
                        good, is not unusually retentive. In the middle years of his career,
                        he devoted from ten to twelve hours a day to studying scores.
                        The youth, whom we shall now call Palestrina, as he is known by the
                        name of his birthplace, returned from Rome at the age of eighteen to
                        his native town, in 1544, as a practising musician, and took a post at
                        the Cathedral of Saint Agapitus. Here he engaged himself for life, to
                        be present every day at mass and vespers, and to teach singing to
                        the canons and choristers. Thus he spent the early years of his young
                        manhood directing the daily services and drumming the rudiments of
                        music into the heads of the little choristers. It may have been dry
                        and wearisome labor; but afterward, when Palestrina began to reform
                        the music of the church, it must have been of great advantage to him
                        to know so absolutely the liturgy, not only of Saint Peters and Saint
                        John Lateran, but also that in the simple cathedral of his own small
                        hill-town.
                        At Naples, their next stopping place, Wolfgang played before a
                        brilliant company, and excited so much astonishment, that people
                        declared his power in playing came from a ring he wore on his finger.
                        \x22He wears a charm,\x22 they cried. Mozart smiled, took off the ring and
                        played more brilliantly than ever. Then the enthusiasm was redoubled.
                        The Neapolitans showed them every attention and honor. A carriage
                        was provided for their use, and we have an account of how they drove
                        through the best streets, the father wearing a maroon-colored coat
                        with light blue facings, and Wolfgang in one of apple green, with
                        rose-colored facings and silver buttons."

                        \x22Elijah\x22 which had long grown in his mind, until it was on the eve
                        of completion in the spring of 1846. In a letter to the famous singer
                        Jenny Lind, an intimate friend, he writes: \x22I am jumping about my
                        room for joy. If my work turns out half as good as I fancy it is, how
                        pleased I shall be.\x22
                        So he spoke to Legouve; and he sat down on a stone in a Paris street,
                        and wept. In the meantime, the old lady did not understand this
                        foolishness; she hardly tolerated it, and sought to undeceive him.
                        Above all, one must not make the mistake of contrasting Berlioz with
                        Wagner, either by sacrificing Berlioz to that Germanic Odin, or by
                        forcibly trying to reconcile one to the other. For there are some who
                        condemn Berlioz in the name of Wagners theories; and others who, not
                        liking the sacrifice, seek to make him a forerunner of Wagner, or kind
                        of elder brother, whose mission was to clear a way and prepare a road
                        for a genius greater than his own. Nothing is falser. To understand
                        Berlioz one must shake off the hypnotic influence of Bayreuth. Though
                        Wagner may have learnt something from Berlioz, the two composers have
                        nothing in common; their genius and their art are absolutely opposed;
                        each one has ploughed his furrow in a different field.
                        The concert took place in the Imperial Opera House, just ten days
                        after his arrival, and from all accounts was a great success. Chopin
                        was more than satisfied, he was delighted. Indeed his success was so
                        emphatic that a second concert was given the following week. In both
                        he played some of his own compositions and improvised as well."

  communication_note: "Felix was at this time but little more than twelve years old. He had
                        within the last year composed fifty or sixty pieces, including a trio
                        for piano and strings, containing three movements, several sonatas for
                        the piano, some songs and a musical comedy in three scenes, for
                        piano and voices. All these were written with the greatest care and
                        precision, and with the date of each neatly added. He collected his
                        pieces into volumes; and the more work he did the more neatly he
                        wrote.
                        Hardly had he left the school when he was drafted for the army. This
                        meant several years of virtual captivity, for conscription could not
                        be avoided. The only other thing he could do was to return home and
                        become a teacher in his fathers school. He chose the lesser evil and
                        qualified at once to become his fathers assistant, which would also
                        assure him a certain amount of leisure. We can imagine him installed
                        as teacher of the infant class, and realize how distasteful was the
                        daily round of school work, and how he longed to have it over, that he
                        might put on paper all the lovely themes that had come to him through
                        the school day. Other bright spots were the happy hours he spent with
                        the Grob family, who lived also in the district of Lichtenthal.
                        The family consisted of a mother, a son and daughter. They were all
                        musical. Therese Grob had a fine voice and she enjoyed the songs
                        Schubert brought her to sing, while her brother Heinrich could play
                        both piano and cello. Many evenings filled with music were passed by
                        the young people. His friends at the Convict too, welcomed each new
                        piece he wrote. Nor did he forget his old master Holzer, the organist
                        of the little church where the composer himself regularly attended.
                        During 1814, Schubert composed his first mass, which was performed
                        October 16. It excited so much interest that it was repeated ten days
                        later at the Augustine church. Franz conducted, the choir was led
                        by Holzer, Ferdinand sat at the organ, and Therese sang the soprano
                        solos. In the audience sat old Salieri, Court Capellmeister of Vienna,
                        with whom Beethoven had studied. Salieri praised Schubert for his
                        work, and said that he should become his pupil. He kept his word and
                        gave the young composer daily lessons for some time. The father was
                        so proud and happy that he bought a five octave piano for his boy, to
                        celebrate the event.
                        The road that stretches before us is long and difficult. But if we turn
                        our heads and look back over the way we have come we may take heart.
                        Which of us does not feel a little glow of pride at the thought of what
                        has been done in the last thirty years? Here is a town where, before
                        1870, music had fallen to the most miserable depths, which to-day teems
                        with concerts and schools of music--a town where one of the first
                        symphonic schools in Europe has sprung from nothing, a town where an
                        enthusiastic concert-going public has been formed, possessing among its
                        members some great critics with broad interests and a fine, free
                        spirit--all this is the pride of France. And we have, too, a little band
                        of musicians; among them, in the first rank, that great painter of
                        dreams, Claude Debussy; that master of constructive art, Dukas; that
                        impassioned thinker, Alberic Magnard; that ironic poet, Ravel; and those
                        delicate and finished writers, Albert Roussel and Deodat de Severac;
                        without mention of the younger musicians who are in the vanguard of
                        their art. And all this poetic force, though not the most vigorous, is
                        the most original in Europe to-day. Whatever gaps one may find in our
                        musical organisation, still so new, whatever results this movement may
                        lead to, it is impossible not to admire a people whom defeat has
                        aroused, and a generation that has accomplished the magnificent work of
                        reviving the nations music with such untiring perseverance and such
                        steadfast faith. The names of Camille Saint-Saens, Cesar Franck, Charles
                        Bordes, and Vincent dIndy, will remain associated before all others
                        with this work of national regeneration, where so much talent and so
                        much devotion, from the leaders of orchestras and celebrated composers
                        down to that obscure body of artists and music-lovers, have joined
                        forces in the fight against indifference and routine. They have the
                        right to be proud of their work. But for ourselves, let us waste no time
                        in thinking about it. Our hopes are great. Let us justify them."

                        with little money for present necessities, Wagner and his companions
                        arrived in Paris in September, 1839. Before him lay, if he had but
                        known it, two years and a half of bitter hardship and privation;
                        but--\x22out of trials and tribulations are great spirits molded.\x22
                        When the little girl left the piano, or the harpsichord, as it was
                        called in those days, Wolfgang slipped into her place and began to
                        repeat with his tiny fingers what his father had taught her. He sought
                        the different intervals, and when at last he found them, his little
                        face beamed with joy. In a short time he was able to play all the
                        simple exercises that had been given his sister.

                        production of opera in the Italian style. Later these productions
                        had to be given up for lack of money, and the Kings Theater remained
                        closed for a long time. Finally a number of rich men formed a society
                        to revive opera in London. The King subscribed liberally to the
                        venture. Handel was at once engaged as composer and impressario. He
                        started work on a new opera and when that was well along, set out for
                        Germany, going to Dresden to select singers. On his return he stopped
                        at Halle, where his mother was still living, but his old teacher had
                        passed away.
                        The next place was Luneburg and there the young musician had such
                        success that a second concert was at once announced. Two were next
                        given at Hildesheim. Then came Leipsic, Hanover and after that Weimer,
                        where Franz Liszt and his retinue of famous pupils held court. Here
                        Johannes became acquainted with Raff, Klindworth, Mason, Prekner and
                        other well-known musicians."

  communication_note: "After a concert, keyed to feverish excitement, he often plays over
                        piano scores of every number that appeared on the program. Then he
                        may lie awake all night, worrying over two possible tempi in which
                        he might have taken some passage--shadings in rhythm that the average
                        listener would not, could not discern.
                        While at work in Paris, young Debussy made an occasional side trip to
                        another country. In 1879 he visited Russia, where he learned to know
                        the music of that land, yet undreamed of by the western artists. When
                        his turn came to go to Rome, for which honor he secured the prize, he
                        sent home the required compositions, a Symphonic Suite \x22Spring,\x22 and
                        a lyric poem for a womans voice, with chorus and orchestra, entitled
                        \x22La Demoiselle Elue.\x22
                        During his long convalescence he was seized with a great desire for
                        knowledge, and read everything he could lay hands on. He would often
                        sit at the piano, busying his fingers with technic while reading a
                        book on the desk before him. He had formerly given all his time to
                        music and languages; now he must know literature, politics, history
                        and exact sciences. A word casually dropped in conversation, would
                        start him on a new line of reading. Then came the revolution of 1830.
                        Everybody talked politics, and Franz, with his excitable spirits,
                        would have rushed into the conflict if his mother had not restrained
                        him."

                        \x22have such an intensity that they will not bear harmonising--_as in many
                        ancient folk-songs_--and often even an accompaniment spoils their
                        fulness.\x22[89] These melodies so correspond with the emotions, that they
                        reproduce the least thrills of body and mind by their vigorous
                        workings-up and delicate reliefs, by splendid barbarities of modulation
                        and strong and glowing colour, by gentle gradations of light and shade
                        or imperceptible ripples of thought, which flow over the body like a
                        steady tide. It is an art of peculiar sensitiveness, more delicately
                        expressive than that of Wagner; not satisfying itself with the modern
                        tonality, but going back to old modes--a rebel, as M. Saint-Saens
                        remarks, to the polyphony which had governed music since Bachs day, and
                        which is perhaps, after all, \x22a heresy destined to disappear.\x22[90]

  communication_note: "The programme of this new school was explained by M. Vincent dIndy in
                        his Inauguration speech on 2 November, 1900, and showed how he based the
                        foundations of musical teaching upon history.
                        In France we have never had--apart from a few attempts in
                        _opera-comique_--a recitative that exactly expressed our natural speech.
                        Lully and Rameau took for their model the high-flown declamation of the
                        tragedy stage of their time. And French opera for the past twenty years
                        has chosen a more dangerous model still--the declamation of Wagner, with
                        its vocal leaps and its resounding and heavy accentuation. Nothing could
                        be more displeasing in French. All people of taste suffered from it,
                        though they did not admit it. At this time, Antoine, Gemier, and Guitry
                        were making theatrical declamation more natural, and this made the
                        exaggerated declamation of the French opera appear more ridiculous and
                        more archaic still. And so a reform in recitative was inevitable.
                        Jean-Jacques Rousseau had foreseen it in the very direction in which
                        Debussy[201] has accomplished it. He showed in his _Lettre sur la
                        musique francaise_ that there was no connection between the inflections
                        of French speech, \x22whose accents are so harmonious and simple,\x22 and \x22the
                        shrill and noisy intonations\x22 of the recitative of French opera. And he
                        concluded by saying that the kind of recitative that would best suit us
                        should \x22wander between little intervals, and neither raise nor lower the
                        voice very much; and should have little sustained sound, no noise, and
                        no cries of any description--nothing, indeed, that resembled singing,
                        and little inequality in the duration or value of the notes, or in their
                        intervals.\x22 This is the very definition of Debussys recitative."

                        between--and see the walls and towers of Rome. At the time of our
                        story, Saint Peters had withstood the sack of the city, which
                        happened a dozen years before, and Bramantes vast basilica had
                        already begun to rise. The artistic life of Rome was still at high
                        tide, for Raphael had passed away but twenty years before, and Michael
                        Angelo was at work on his Last Judgment.
                        The two years of indecision were fruitful in producing much piano
                        music and in completing the beautiful E minor Concerto, which was
                        rehearsed with orchestra and was performed at the third and last
                        concert he ever gave in Warsaw. This concert was arranged for October
                        11, 1830. Chopin requested Constantia Gladowska, whom he had never
                        met, to sing an aria. In the success of the evening sorrow was
                        forgotten. He wrote to his friend: \x22Miss Gladowska wore a white gown
                        with roses in her hair and was wondrously beautiful; she had never
                        sung so well.\x22

                        study from a purely historical point of view, by eliminating all
                        personal feeling--which would be of no value here. As a matter of fact,
                        I am not a Debussyite; my sympathies are with quite another kind of art.
                        But I feel impelled to give homage to a great artist, whose work I am
                        able to judge with some impartiality.]"

                        from the last years of the _Ancien Regime_ and the Revolution, was
                        designed by its patriotic and-democratic origin to serve the cause of
                        national art and free progress.[210]
                        Before Franz was six, as we have seen, he had already begun his
                        musical studies. If not sitting at the piano, he would scribble
                        notes--for he had learned without instruction how to write them long
                        before he knew the letters of the alphabet, or rudiments of writing.
                        His small hands were a source of trouble to him, and he resorted to
                        all kinds of comical expedients, such as sometimes playing extra notes
                        with the tip of his nose. Indeed his ingenuity knew no bounds, when it
                        came to mastering some musical difficulty."

                        of completion in the spring of 1846. In a letter to the famous singer
                        Jenny Lind, an intimate friend, he writes: \x22I am jumping about my

                        The Lamoureux Concerts had served their purpose, and, in their turn,
                        their heroic mission came to an end. They had forced Wagner on Paris;
                        and Paris, as always, had overshot the mark, and could swear by no one
                        but Wagner. French musicians were translating Gounods or Massenets
                        ideas into Wagners style; Parisian critics repeated Wagners theories
                        at random, whether they understood them or not--generally when they did
                        not understand them. A reaction was inevitable directly Paris was well
                        saturated with Wagner; and it came about in 1890, among a chosen few,
                        some of whom had been, and were even still, under Wagners influence. It
                        was at first only a mild reaction, and showed itself in a return to the
                        classics of the past and to the great primitives in music.

                        pour balm on my wounds. Ah yes, if you only could! But no herb
                        grows that could cure my sickness; only a god could help me. If you
                        can give me back my inspirations, and wake up the familiar spirit
                        that is asleep in me, and let him possess me anew, I will call you
                        a god and raise altars to your name. My cry is to gods and not to
                        men; the gods alone are fit to pronounce my fate. But however it
                        may end, even if the worst comes, I will bear it--yes, even if no
                        ray of sunshine lightens my life again.... And with that we will,
                        once for all, turn the page and have done with this dark chapter of
                        my life.\x22
                        Five years the boy Franz Schubert remained at the Convict School and
                        as he had decided to give himself entirely to music, there was no
                        reason for his remaining longer in the school. At the end of the year
                        1813, he left, and his departure was celebrated by the composition of
                        his first Symphony, in honor of Dr. Lang, the musical director. The
                        lad, now seventeen, stood at the beginning of his career; he was full
                        of hope and energy, and determined to follow in the footsteps of the
                        great masters of music. Of all his compositions so far produced, his
                        songs seemed to be the most spontaneous. He probably did not guess
                        that he was to open up new paths in this field."

                        ignored him, threw himself into Berliozs arms when he met him in London
                        in 1855. \x22He embraced him with fervour, and wept; and hardly had he left
                        him when _The Musical World_ published passages from his book, _Oper und

                        with his compositions,[30] or in trying to supplant him at the theatre.
                        At the Opera he was passed over in favour of a Prince Poniatowski.
                        Those traits began to come to the surface in 1922, when he had been
                        bossing the Philadelphia band for ten years. About that time he seemed
                        no longer satisfied with merely playing to his audiences--he started

                        14, but I must have a theatrical success; Camilles parents insist on
                        that, as a condition of our marriage. I hope I shall succeed.\x22"

                        dumb keyboard, to exercise his fingers upon. Every morning, after he
                        had done what was necessary in the house, Hannes was sent afield by
                        the kind mistress of the household, and told not to show himself till
                        dinner time. Perhaps the good mistress did not know that Hannes had
                        enjoyed himself out of doors hours before. He used to rise at four
                        oclock and begin his day with a bath in the river. Shortly after this
                        the little girl, Lischen, would join him and they would spend a couple
                        of hours rambling about, looking for birds nests, hunting butterflies
                        and picking wild flowers. Hannes pale cheeks soon became plump and
                        ruddy, as the result of fresh air and country food. Musical work
                        went right on as usual. Studies in theory and composition, begun with
