  general_note: "The Sonata for Violin  and Piano is in one movement of five contrasting sections.  It dates from 1950 and was composed for two well-known musicians.  The violinist was Ruth Pearl, from England, who had settled here shortly after the Second World War and was for some time the leader of the Lindsay String Orchestra.  The pianist was Frederick Page, for many years professor of Music at Victoria University.  These artists performed the work throughout New Zealand and took it on tour for the Chamber Music Federation.  Even now it remains the one sonata for violin and piano by a New Zealand composer that is heard with any frequency."

  general_note: "Hotspur was commissioned by Musicon, with funding from Northern Arts, and was written while Fleur Adcock (librettist) and Gillian Whitehead were both Fellows of the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Decorative banners by Gretchen Albrecht were commissioned by the NZ Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first performance at Durham, given by the Gemini ensemble, conducted by Peter Wiegold, with Margaret Field (soprano), on February 1 1981.  Hotspur is the lament of Elizabeth Mortimer, wife of Henry Percy, the 14th century North of England warrior know as �Hotspur.�  While writing in Northumberland, not so far from the site of the battle of Otterburn, I was very aware of the harsh quality of life in these border regions in Hotspur�s day, when skirmishing and reiving where the means of survival in a wild, exposed, though beautiful landscape and a climate sometimes benign but often treacherous. Something of this has influenced the music.  The text called for a certain simplicity (although the piece is not simple technically): the vocal line especially had to be direct and could not depart very far from the idea of the ballad, except in the reflective middle movement and in the recurring prophetic sections.  The instrumental sections sometimes accompany, sometimes comment on, and  sometimes reinforce the expression of the text: often they contrast suggestions of movement and stillness, or of battle sounds and the sounds of nature. There are five sections: 1. Elizabeth sings of her husband 2. The siege of Newcastle 3. Elizabeth, carrying Hotspur�s child, reflects on the past as she waits on the evening of the battle of Otterburn 4. The battle of Otterburn The death of Hotspur "

  general_note: "In January 1998 Gareth Farr was commissioned by the James Wallace Chariable Trust to write this Piano Trio for the Ogen Trio, a leading NZ ensemble. Taking its subtitle \"Ahi\" from the Maori word for \"fire\", it received its debut performance in Auckland, NZ in March 1998 in the presence of the composer. The style of the work varies in each of the four movements: the flavour of a French lullaby predominates in the first; an intense and unrelenting second movement harbours overtones of a Russian military factory; whilst a Balinese pop-inspired fourth movement contains numerous gamelan-like effects. The brief third movement is merely a quiet interlude, with a melodic reference to the first movement. The composition stands in stark contrast to Farr's previous works. He has experimented with stripping away the density characteristic of past compositions in favour of clearer textures, exploring classical form, and allowing a simplicity of line to come through and speak for itself."

  general_note: "These songs are designed to be sung by younger singers"
  internal_note: "0 ,,Performance notes These songs were designed to be sung by younger singers (but singers of any age are welcome to use them!). The vocal ranges are not extreme, and at the most basic level they can be sung as unison songs (or even solo songs) with piano accompaniment. Conductors are welcome to experiment with contrasting smaller and larger groups, and the use of the harmony part as either an instrumental or vocal line (see note #1 below). The main melody line generally lies between middle C and the F an octave and a half higher. As solo songs they would particularly suit mezzo-soprano and baritone voice ranges. The following more specific points should be noted: The harmony part is optional (although desirable). It may be sung (using an 'ah' vowel sound), or it may be played on a suitable instrument (e.g. flute, clarinet, violin, synthesizer etc.). If played, it should ideally be performed an octave higher than written, although some of the higher phrases may be left \"at pitch\". If performed by 2-part choir, note that the harmony part is not necessarily an alto part. The vocal line may be doubled by instruments if required. In some places the harmony line is not intended to be sung, but is rather an instrumental line - this is marked in the music as �instrumental� (see also note 4). Where the harmony part is essential (e.g. in �The Gentle Rain�) it has been cued into the piano part - the pianist should only play it when there is no instrument playing the harmony line. Pianists are encouraged to 'embroider' the piano part if they wish. The piano writing has been kept relatively straightforward so as to be performable by pianists of modest technical ability. ,,,,,,These songs are designed to be sung by younger singers,

  general_note: ""
  internal_note: "0 ,,,,The work is inspired by the exploits of Charles Upham VC during the Second World War - although the composer has not, and may not wish to acknowledge this.,,In 1995 I was approached by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra to write an overture to commemorate the recent death of Sir Charles Upham. Upham was famous for having won the Victoria Cross twice for bravery during World War II. He was, however, extremely modest when it came to discussing his achievements. Some years before his death it was suggested to Upham that he have a state funeral; he simply replied \"A bugle will do\". This comment seemed like a good starting point for my piece. There are no bugles in the orchestra, but the opening section depicting the horrors of battle contains plenty of brass. Sub-titled 'Maleme and Ruweisat Ridge', the music is fast and furious, built from several motifs, and including the opening rhythm of the most well-known Maori haka (war dance), 'Kamate, kamate'. The music builds to a climax and the scene changes to a bleak Colditz castle, where Upham was imprisoned during the war. While in prison, Upham dreams of rural New Zealand, and the farm near Kaikoura called 'Landsdowne', where he eventually settled after the war. This brief pastoral section links into a coda celebrating the outbreak of peace. Motifs from earlier in the piece return but changed into a brighter mode.  A Bugle will Do was first performed by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra in 1996 under Andrew Sewell, who subsequently performed it with other orchestras in the USA.  Anthony Ritchie.  In 1995 I was approached by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra to write an overture to commemorate the recent death of Sir Charles Upham. Upham was famous for having won the Victoria Cross twice for bravery during World War II. He was, however, extremely modest when it came to discussing his achievements. Some years before his death it was suggested to Upham that he have a state funeral; he simply replied \"A bugle will do\". This comment seemed like a good starting point for my piece. There are no bugles in the orchestra, but the opening section depicting the horrors of battle contains plenty of brass. Sub-titled 'Maleme and Ruweisat Ridge', the music is fast and furious, built from several motifs, and including the opening rhythm of the most well-known Maori haka (war dance), 'Kamate, kamate'. The music builds to a climax and the scene changes to a bleak Colditz castle, where Upham was imprisoned during the war.

The small notes are grace notes which are to be played as fast as possible, but with keeping them even.  Care must be given not to accent the longer notes - all the notes are to be played with the same dynamic. 3.  Accidentals apply only to those notes which they precede 4.  A small eraser is wedged firmly (but not forced) between the lowest A and Bb notes.  On page 5, at (*), the performer plays the lowest Bb (very loudly) with the middle pedal down, and the resultant sound is allowed to resonate until the end of the piece. 5. After the last sound events, all the resonance is allowed to die naturally, and then after a small period of silence the piece finishes.,,,,,,,

That journey and the taking of food, a strong tradition amongst Maori, was the major inspiration for this work. Gillian Whitehead comments, �When I was writing this piece my father was very ill and the night before he died he had a strong desire to eat some fish paste. It was a Sunday and very few shops were open, so despite my best efforts I was unable to buy some for him. When I look back on it, this was the beginning of his journey to the afterlife. I was very disappointed that I had not been able provide the food he requested and in many ways this work is a substitute for that.�  Ahotu (O Matenga) was commissioned by the ensemble, Flederman, with funding assistance from the Australia Council and was first performed at the Adelaide Festival in 1984.

  general_note: "Programme notes with score 'Stellar Meditations' is a series of musical meditations on \"Ave Maris Stella\" (Hail O Star of the Ocean) a popular liturgical chant of unknown origin. It can be dated back to at least the 9th century for it is preserved in the Codex Sangallensis, a 9th century manuscript now in the Swiss Monastery of St. Gallen. Two sound images permeate the piece. One is an ocean image of gentle wave surges and is heard in the introduction. The other is a bell sound which appears in the mallet percussion instruments with resonances in the harmony of muted cornets and trombones. This harmony consists of perfect intervals; fourths and fifths which are subsequently spiced by bell-like tone qualities which create colourful brass sounds.  Structurally, Stellar Meditations consists of an introduction and three chorales separated by two interludes and followed by a coda. The chorales feature the full brass while the interludes and coda are delicately scored in a contrapuntal texture.  "

The latter should be �fingernail pizz.� � the few strings involved can be simply marked in advance. If played on an upright piano, the �pizz.� notes should be played on the keys, but played quite lightly. The flute �gliss,� notes are simply a pitch bend downwards. They need not be a full semitone pitch bend but should be as definite a pitch change as possible. In the final movement bars 113-118, the intended effect is to be very breathy, somewhat percussive, and speaking the indicated consonant sounds into the flute while the indicated pitches are fingered.,,,,,32pp; 0, 32p.,,p1-2,6-7,13-14,22-23 done

However, bar lines are used to indicate phrases and in some places for ease of reading. Accidentals continue until cancelled by a bar line.   Diamond noteheads indicate pitches to be sung while playing. Vocal parts may be transposed by an octave if necessary.

  copyright: "In January 1998 Gareth Farr was commissioned by the James Wallace Chariable Trust to write this Piano Trio for the Ogen Trio, a leading NZ ensemble. Taking its subtitle \"Ahi\" from the Maroi word for \"fire\", it received its debut performance in Auckland, NZ in March 1998 in the presence of the composer.  The style of the work varies in each of the four movements: the flavour of a French lullaby predominates in the first; an intense and unrelenting second movement harbours overtones of a Russian military factory; whilst a Balinese pop-inspired fourth movement contains numerous gamelan-like effects. The brief third movement is merely a quiet interlude, with a melodic reference to the first movement.  The composition stands in stark contrast to Farr's previous works. He has experimented with stripping away the density characteristic of past compositions in favour of clearer textures, exploring classical form, and allowing a simplicity of line to come through and speak for itself."

The call of the ruru, or morepork, of the last stanza became the basis for the sonic material of the work, along with the nocturnal calls of the kiwi.
