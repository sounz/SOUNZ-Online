  venue_name: "St Andrew’s on The Terrace (Presbyterian Church)"
  venue_description: "St Andrew's is considered to have the best acoustics of any performance space of its type in Wellington. Free lunchtime concerts: These go back to the 1960s when school choirs performed.  With the gift of the fine Steinway, the concerts have gone from strength to strength. The opportunity to perform at the church is invaluable, especially to young musicians.  Wellington professional musicians, and occasional visiting musicians, also enjoy performing at St Andrew’s.  These concerts have traditionally paid no fee to musicians, and are free to their audiences, although donations are warmly welcomed.  They are also, in effect, free to the performers as St Andrew’s on The Terrace provides a venue, pays for publicity and “supplies” an audience.  These concerts are advertised in Capital Times a week ahead; broadcast on Radio New Zealand Concert’s Live Diary at around 8.10 am on the day of the concert; included in the Wellingtonian; and listed on St Andrew’s website and Wellington City Council’s Feeling Great recreation and events site www.feelinggreat.co.nz/music. Venue for hire: St Andrew’s is a popular venue for ticket entry concerts, recitals and performances. Mostly classical music, but occasional gospel/choral/jazz concerts are held.  (Contemporary music possibilities in future are being explored.) Regular concerts (quarterly or annual) are presented by Bach Choir, Michael Mohaghan Young Musicians Foundation, New Zealand Opera Society, Pelorus Trust Wellington Brass Band, Sonata Celebration competitions (Institute of Registered Music Teachers), Wagner Society, Wellington Chamber Orchestra, Wellington Suzuki Branch, Wellington Youth Sinfonietta, and many more. 2006 and 2007 concerts, recitals and fundraisers include the Tony Backhouse Choir (Café of the Gate of Salvation), Boutique Opera, Suor Angelica, Wellington Community Choir and Wellington Male Voice Choir, 175 East, Cantoris and Stroma.  In February 2007, St Andrew’s was the venue for the Asia Pacific Festival’s International Lunchtime Concert Series and other concerts.  St Andrew’s is also used for recordings by Radio New Zealand and in December 2006, was the venue for National Radio’s recording of The Little Bushmen."

  venue_name: "Wellington Town Hall"
  venue_description: "In 1900 a competition was held for the design of the Town Hall to be built on the reclamation reserve at the foot of Cuba Street. The design of Joshua Charlesworth, under the nom de plume 'Commonwealth', was selected as the winning entry for its strongly drawn and well organised design in the classical Renaissance manner.  The foundation stone was laid by the Duke of Cornwall and York (later King George V) on 18 June 1901. Construction began in May 1902.  On Wednesday 7 December 1904 Mayor Aitken opened the Town Hall with a gold and greenstone key. A programme of events to celebrate the occasion was spread over four days. It involved the chorus and orchestra of the Wellington Musical union, various soloists, a choir of seven hundred children and a juvenile orchestra of 30 players.  The Wellington Town Hall has had strong ties with Wellington residents and their local body of power. As well as holding many events as part of the Wellington Convention Centre the Town Hall is still the office of the Mayor and city councillors, effectively becoming the centre from which the city is run. The hall's acoustics are internationally renowned, and it has housed thousands of concerts and events over the years, attracting significant visitors and entertainers.   The NZSO, Wellington Vector Orchestra, Chamber Music NZ and other groups regularly present concerts there. "
