  profile: "Dorothy Quita Buchanan (born 1945) grew up one of six sisters in a musical family in Christchurch. Following an education in catholic schools she graduated MusB (Hons) in composition from Canterbury University in 1967. For the next decade she worked as a freelance composer, pianist, violinist (Christchurch Symphony Orchestra) and teacher. In 1976  she was New Zealand's first composer-in-schools and in 1979  became both president of the Composers' Association of New Zealand and the first woman to join the Musicians' Union. In the same year she founded the Christchurch Music Workshops. In 1980 she co-founded the music publishing co-operative Nota Bene which has published works by several New Zealand composers and also has a hire library of New Zealand music suitable for schools and community use. Dorothy has been a guest lecturer, musical director, adjudicator, advisor to teacher support services and an assessor on QEII Arts council (later Creative New Zealand) panels. She was for seven years on the artistic directorate of the Smokefree Women's Composing Festival. Organisations as diverse as school choirs, string quartets, dance and theatre companies and symphony orchestras have commissioned songs, operas, incidental music and film and television scores. Her work for the New Zealand Film Archive from 1984 carried on the family tradition begun by her maternal grandmother Molly Clarke, who played piano for silent movies on the West Coast in the early 1920s. Dorothy's arrangement of the original score for the classic silent film La Passion de Jeanne D'Arc is considered the finest rendering ever. Many of her works are settings for voice of text by New Zealand poets including Lauris Edmond, Fleur Adcock and Janet Frame. She has collaborated with New Zealand writers to produce major operas like the Clio Legacy (Witi Ihimaera) and Woman at the Store and The Mansfield Stories, both from the short stories of Katherine Mansfield. Fragments and Letters, based on her friendship with singer Malcolm McNeill, won the Philip Neill Memorial Prize from the University of Otago in 1995. Awards include a CANZ Outstanding Achievement Award, the Vernon Griffiths Memorial Award for Outstanding Musical Leadership and a Sufferage Medal. In 2001 she was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit (ONZM) for a lifetime's involvement in music. Though she often finds the beginnings of an idea arriving in the most mundane places, like the supermarket, Dorothy's inspiration continues to spring from the land, light and sounds of Aotearoa: \"bird song, flax in summer, a line of hills.\" Photo: Bruce Foster "

She was, until 1984, employed by the Department of Education as Intinerant Teacher of Composition, and worked in nine major secondary schools in the Christchurch area.  As a result of her work as a teacher, there has been a \"noted\" school of young Christchurch composers, some of whom are now employed in composition and associated areas of the arts and education.  Dorothy Buchanan is one of New Zealand's most sought after composers, fulfilling commissions for the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, the Music Federation of New Zealand, as well as writing a fund of music for educational use.

Dorothy Buchanan has collaborated with, and used New Zealand artists' words and works in much of her music.  Painters Philip Tristtum and Rosemary Campbell, novelists Janet Frame and Margaret Mahy, poets Ian Wedde and Ruth Gilbert, and satirist A.K.

  profile: "Ioannis (John) Psathas was born in Wellington New Zealand July 3rd 1966. His father  (Emmanuel Psathas, from Nea Michaniona) and mother (Anastasia Psathas, from Thessaloniki) emigrated to New Zealand in 1960 (both sides of John's ancestors descend from Anatoliki Thrace).  The Psathas family entered the restaurant business and John grew up in a small New Zealand town, Taumaranui. He then went to college in the city of Napier - where he developed a strong interest in music. He left college early to study piano and composition at Victoria University of Wellington. In 1988 John's parents and sister (Tania) returned to Greece permanently. His parents live in Nea Michaniona. After completing his Master's degree, John studied and worked for 2 years in the USA and in Belgium. Before returning to New Zealand in 1994 where he has lectured at Victoria University's School of Music (now the New Zealand School of Music) ever since. He recently achieved the status of Associated Professor.  John Psathas, is now one of New Zealand's most internationally acclaimed composers. With performances in venues from Windsor Castle to Kalamazoo, Jakarta to Bermuda, Japan to Alaska, and Hong Kong to Tel Aviv, he has established and maintains an international reputation. His music is heard worldwide and is regularly performed throughout Europe, America, Australasia, and Asia.  John Psathas' music has been performed by percussion superstar Evelyn Glennie, 11 time Grammy winner Michael Brecker, Joshua Redman, Pedro Carneiro, Michael Houstoun, Federico Mondelci, Orchestre Sinfonia Dell'Emilia-Romagna 'Toscanini', the Halle Orchestra, the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the Netherlands Blazers Ensemble, the New Juilliard Ensemble and many other performers, ensembles and orchestras. Psathas has written extensively for Evelyn Glennie, who, in her debut in the prestigious New York Great Performer's Series devoted nearly half her program to his work. Early success came with 'Matre's Dance' in 1991, a maximum-energy duet for percussion and piano that has since made Psathas' name internationally through having been taken up and championed by Glennie. This work and 'Drum Dances' have become standard repertoire for percussionists throughout the world. John's relationship with Evelyn Glennie has been a particularly fruitful one for them both. Her repertoire includes 'Matre's Dance', 'Drum Dances', 'Spike', 'Happy Tachyons' and the double concerto for piano and percussion, 'View from Olympus'. She has recorded 'Matre's Dance' on her CDs 'Drumming' and 'Greatest Hits' (BMG).  Michael Brecker and the Orchestra Sinfonica dell'Emilia-Romagna 'Toscanini' premiered his saxophone concerto 'Omnifenix', in 2000 in Bologna at a large outdoor concert and broadcast through out Europe. It was this performance which first drew Psathas' name to international attention. Critics described this piece as a true hybrid of jazz and western art music. In its successful combination of these two disparate elements, the concerto wowed the 6000-strong audience and paved the way for further international performances of Psathas' larger concert works. Notable amongst these was the programming of the Percussion Concerto (for four soloists and orchestra) at the 2001 'Klangspuren' Festival in Schwaz, Austria. In 2002, 'View from Olympus' was given its premiere during the Manchester Commonwealth Games by Evelyn Glennie and Philip Smith with the Halle Orchestra conducted by Mark Elder at the Royal Gala finale concert of the 'Pulse' International Festival of Rhythm. A sold-out retrospective concert of Psathas' chamber music was given in the 2000 New Zealand International Festival of the Arts. The 2002 International Festival also featured a major new commission, 'Psyzygysm', a concerto for mallet percussion and chamber ensemble which featured the young Portuguese virtuoso percussionist Pedro Carneiro as star soloist - this work received it European premiere in Lisbon in 2006.  Notable performances of 2004 included the premiere season of 'Zeibekiko', a major commission from the Nederlands Blazers Ensemble (NBE), which invited him to create an entire programme based around the theme of 2500 years of Greek Music. This collaborative work was performed by the NBE throughout Holland and at the Bath Festival (UK). 'Three Psalms' (for solo piano, percussion, harp and strings), commissioned by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra was premiered at concerts throughout New Zealand in April 2004 by US pianist Stephen Gosling with the NZSO under James Judd. To date, his most notable accomplishment in the field of music has been to write much of the ceremonial music for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Athens 2004 Olympics Games. 2006 saw the release of a CD/DVD project: 'View From Olympus'. This is New Zealand's most ambitious orchestral recording project ever and has been released to wide critical acclaim. View From Olympus went straight to the top of the Classical Music Charts in New Zealand and remained there for five months. Closer to home, his music opened the doors of Te Papa in 1998, and in 1997 his percussion concerto was premiered by Glennie and the NZSO.  He has written for the NZSO and the Auckland Philharmonia, pianists Michael Houstoun, Deidre Irons, David Guerin, Dan Poynton, as well as the NZ Trio, the NZ String Quartet, the Kandinsky Ensemble and Saxcess. But it is the sheer power of his music that, despite its complexity, engages a wide range of listeners - both in and out of the concert hall. This is marking him out as a potent artistic force. Mentor and now colleague, Jack Body has said: \"Many of his compositions have an energy and drive more extreme than any other music I know - it sweeps one up on a frantic roller-coaster ride and carries one to that height of exhilaration.\" His music is energetic and vibrant, with a passionate exuberance that is a product of his Greek heritage. In his music one can hear both the Western classical tradition as well as the kinetic enthusiasm found in jazz and Greek folk music. His compositional style is difficult to define as each piece is unique and creates its own musical language, but regardless of the medium, whether it's jazz quintet or string quartet, there is a constant intensity and immediacy in his music.

She has recorded \"Matre's Dance\" on her CD \"Drumming\" (BMG Catalyst 09026 68195 2). She has commissioned three more works from him to be written over the next two years. A CD of other works by John Psathas entitled \"Rhythm Spike\" has been released this year by Rattle Records, and was awarded the Recording Industry of NZ Classical Award for 2000.  Glenda Keam, writing in Music in New Zealand (Summer 1998-99)says of his work,\" The music of John Psathas is generally regarded as very difficult, very exciting, often motoric and sometimes very fast-moving. And yet it is extremely difficult to generalise convincingly about what the Psathas characteristics are; each new work holds its own special compositional challenges - there is no writing-to-formula here, and the rewards for composer and audience alike lie in the palpable freshness of each work.   John Psathas (1966) is a New Zealand freelance composer and teacher. John Psathas is one of New Zealand's most frequently performed composers. With works in the repertoire of such high profile musicians as Evelyn Glennie, Michael Brecker, the New Juilliard Ensemble, BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, NEw Zealand Symphony Orchestra, Michael Houstoun, Pedro Carneiro, Federico Mondelci, and others, he has achieved what was until recently held to be an impossibility for a composer of contemporary New Zealand music - he is establishing a solid international profile, and receiving regular commission offers from outside New Zealand.  Psathas, who grew up in Taumaranui and then Napier, left high school early to go and study composition and piano at Victoria University of Welington. He supported himself as a student by playing  gigs in a jazz trio and a Greek dance band.  Psathas studied further with composer Jacqueline Fontyn in Belgium before returning to New Zealand, where he has since lectured in music at Victoria University and continued to fulfill a busy schedule of commissions.  Early success came with Matre's Dance in 1991, a maximum-energy duet for percussion and piano that has since made Psathas' name internationally through having been taken up and championed by percussionist Evelyn Glennie. This work and Drum Dances are fast becoming standard repertoire for percussionists throughout the world.  A new work by John Psathas is an individual, unique entity, and his music is like that of no-one else. His  'sound' is difficult to define - the harmony and improvisational feel of jazz, the compelling rhythmic drive and excitement of rock music and the sustained repetitive textures of minimalism are apparent as influences, yet they combine and intermingle with something else more intangible. This undefinable quality is partly what makes his the most original voice in the arena of contemporary classical music in New Zealand.  John's relationship with Evelyn Glennie has been a particularly fruitful one for them both. Her performing repertoire includes Matre's Dance, Drum Dances, Spike, and Happy Tachyons. She has recorded Matre's Dance on her CD's  \"Drumming\" and \"Greatest Hits\"(BMG), and she continues to commission new works: forthcoming projects include a Concerto for solo percussionist and orchestra and a Double Concerto for piano, percussion and orchestra.   A recent highlight was the programming of a concert devoted entirely to John's music at the 2000 New Zealand International Festival of the Arts. In the programme, John described the process for him of creating  music: \"When I write music, it's not a sense of inventing I experience, as much as it is a sense of finding something that exists at the remote periphery of what I know. It is like seeing things - that aren't really there - in the  corner of one's eye, but not spinning around to view them, because then they would simply cease to be. It is a case of being aware of a thing in one's peripheral vision and, while staring straight ahead, trying to  decipher, without looking at it, the true nature of what it is. What one is finding is exactly the right thing for any given moment in a musical work.\"Composing for me is essentially a continual re-travelling of a journey that begins with 'any conceivable thing is possible at this moment' and concludes with, 'it couldn't be anything but this'. There are some piano phrases in the first movement of the quintet which were so difficult to 'find' that I came very close to really giving up. Now that they've been discovered, they flow naturally in and out of the fabric of the work and no-one would be capable of sensing the colossal frustration experienced in placing the right notes in the right place at the right time. It is one of the great ironies composers have always endured, that the labour, agony, and difficulty which are part of the process of writing music, must never be audible in the finished work.\"   Recent News (please check out the website for more uptodate stuff if you need it)  September 1999 - Release of Rhythm Spike CD by Rattle Records, featuring eight chamber and instrumental works.

Psathas, who grew up in Taumaranui and then Napier, left high school early to go and study composition and piano at Victoria University of Wellington.

This work was tailored to the particular improvising talents of tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker. A retrospective concert of Psathas' chamber music was given in the 2000 New Zealand International Festival of the Arts, culminating with the premiere of the specially commissioned Piano Quintet. In the programme to the concert, John described the process for him of creating music: \"When I write music, it's not a sense of inventing I experience, as much as it is a sense of finding something that exists at the remote periphery of what I know.

Mentor and now colleague, Jack Body has said: \"Many of his compositions have an energy and drive more extreme than any other music I know - it sweeps one up on a frantic roller-coaster ride and carries one to that height of exhilaration.\" His music is energetic and vibrant, with a passionate exuberance that is a product of his Greek heritage. In his music one can hear both the Western classical tradition as well as the kinetic enthusiasm found in jazz and Greek folk music. His compositional style is difficult to define as each piece is unique and creates its own musical language, but regardless of the medium, whether it's jazz quintet or string quartet, there is a constant intensity and immediacy in his music.

Died Address: 8 Lynch Street, Point Chevalier, Auckland 2. Tel: (09) 861 038.      William Dart Obituary Musician. Died aged 79.  Ron Dellow was a quiet dynamo, a modest man who contributed much to the music of Auckland.  Choirmaster, composer, organist, harpsichordist, teacher and, above all, a tireless administrator, his many talents were recognised in 1980 with an MBE for services to music. Composer John Rimmer quotes a 12th century Chinese poem, when asked about Ron: \"If you want to be a leader, walk behind the people rather than in front of them.\"   But Ron Dellow was more than just a leader, he was a helper. As Rimmer puts it, \"a humble person who got things done and who stimulated others to help him to do things he wanted to do\". Dellow was co-founder of the New Zealand Recorder Society in 1954; on the choral scene, the city's Bach Musica group has its origins in the Bach Cantata Society which he headed in the late 70s. One of New Zealand's first professionally trained church musicians, his skill as choirmaster and organist enriched many churches.   Dellow was one of the driving forces behind the Cambridge Music School for 21 years. For Rimmer this was his \"crowning achievement\". Growing up in Whakatane in the 50s and 60s, I knew Ron Dellow as a regular visitor.  His concerts with his Community Arts Singers helped determine me on a musical career and he'd also been a more than sympathetic judge when I'd taken part in local competitions and festivals.   Ron Dellow is survived by his wife Jean, a son and three daughters. Died 22 or 23 April 2004   "

  profile: "David Downes (b. 1967) is a New Zealand born composer/performer/film-maker. His compositions have included private and public commissions, theatre/film scores, orchestral works, electro-acoustic pieces, and songwriting. Since 1988 he has also made a considerable contribution to modern choreographic work in New Zealand with his contemporary dance scores. Overall, David's work, although disparate in both style and form, clearly draws its main influence from popular music but is strengthened by several years of classical piano training and a graduate degree in music composition. It shares a common ground of solid, often complex, rhythmic structures, and has been described as 'intense, haunting and evocative'. As a performer (keyboards, vocals, guitar, drums, electronics), David has been involved in many shows and tours with bands and theatre productions. Most noteably these include a tour of China over nine months in 1996, performances at two southern hemisphere Womad festivals with Mahinarangi Tocker and a tour of the highly acclaimed Dance Opera 'Jerusalem' for which he both composed the score and performed live as one of seven singers. Having lived and worked in New Zealand, the United Kingdom and China, David has collaborated with musicians from a variety of backgrounds and cultures, the influence of which can be heard in many of his pieces. David's involvement with video/film developed as a natural extension to his interest in music and sonic art. His work in experimental music video, long form narrative filmmaking, animation and computer generated imagery has produced several award winning films including the 2000 digital feature 'a small life' and the 2004 animated short 'Generation'. Inspired by the work and philosophies of artists such as Len Lye, fascinated with the language of metaphor and believing in the strength of the medium hybrid, David often looks to other disciplines in the process of creating and realising ideas. He also employs the, sometimes unusual, use of technology to investigate creative potentials. This investigation has sparked an ongoing design and construction of several instruments and noise devices which have been employed in various music projects. These include simple harmonic feedback drivers for amplified guitar, a battery of electromechanical percussion instruments and a midi/servo controlled, acoustic string instrument. A strange extension of these interests began in 2000 when he started to raise and train a magpie for the specific purpose of performing an original composition. (July 2007)     "

Downes's video work began in 1986 as a teenager when he submitted a short piece to a national music video competition and won. This encouraged Downes to continue exploring the medium and led to commissions for various film festivals and gallery exhibitions.

  profile: "Gareth Farr (b.1968) began his studies in composition and percussion performance at the University of Auckland.  The experience of hearing a visiting gamelan orchestra prompted his return to Wellington to attend Victoria University, where the characteristic rhythms and textures of the Indonesian gamelan rapidly became hallmarks of his own composition.  Farr continued with postgraduate study in composition and percussion at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, where his teachers included Samuel Adler and Christopher Rouse. In 1993, at the age of 25, Farr was appointed composer-in-residence by Chamber Music New Zealand, the youngest-ever composer to hold that position. This resulted in the composition of three substantial works, \"Owhiro\" (String Quartet No.1), \"Kebyar Moncar\" for gamelan, and the chamber sextet \"Cadenza\".  At the conclusion of the residence, Farr returned to the Eastman School to begin a doctorate in composition.  As well as composing \"Kembang Suling\" for flute and marimba (his most popular work to date) and three works for orchestra during his time, Farr also introduced audiences to his on-stage alter ego, the percussion-playing drag queen Lilith Lacroix. The inclusion of his works in four events at the 1996 New Zealand International Festival of the Arts - the ballet score for Douglas Wright's \"Buried Venus\", \"Lilith's Dream of Ecstasy\" for orchestra, \"Kembang Suling\", and the Bach-in-Bali piano solo \"Sepuluh Jari\" kick-started his career as a dedicated freelance composer.  Since then, his music has been heard at, or especially commissioned for high-profile events including the 50th anniversary of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra (the 25-minute \"From the Depths Sound the Great Sea Gongs\"), the opening of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (\"Te Papa\", for orchestra with soprano, tenor and kaikaranga (indigenous New Zealand Maori chant), a work hailed as 'music with a powerful and moving impact that transcends idiom and individual taste'), and the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney (\"Hikoi\", a concerto for percussionist Evelyn Glennie and the NZSO).  A commission by the 2003 Auckland Festival resulted in the massive \"Stone and Ice\", composed for the combined forces of the NZSO and the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra. Gareth Farr's music is particularly influenced by his extensive study of percussion, both Western and non-Western.  Rhythmic elements of his compositions can be seen to derive from the complex and exciting rhythms of Rarotongan log drum ensembles, Balinese gamelan and other percussion music of the Pacific Rim.  Naturally, percussion has always been a central focus of Farr's music, and in 2003-04, he produced a number of works either specifically for or premiered by the STRIKE percussion ensemble, with which he has had a long and fruitful association.  As well as the ferocious percussion quartet \"Pukul\", there are two major works featuring concertante parts for percussion ensemble, \"Onslaught\" for brass band and percussion and the \"Concerto for Percussion and Orchestra\".  The latter work was the result of a commission from the Wellington City Council and the Wellington Sinfonia to compose a work in celebration of the centenary of the city's Town Hall. In addition to his music for the concert chamber, Farr has written music for dance, theatre and television. (January 2006) "

His music is heavily influenced by his extensive study of percussion, both Western and non-Western. Rhythmic elements of his compositions can be linked to the complex and exciting rhythms of Rarotongan log ddrum ensembles, Balinese Gamelan and other percussion music of the Pacific Rim.

  profile: " Frykberg, Susan.   MA (SFU)  Susan Frykberg (New Zealand/Canada) is a composer of electroacoustic and instrumental music who often combines feminist ideas and selected theatrical processes in her work. She has created a number of 'environments' in which stories (often mythological), of women's lives are the context for her music. Since the birth of her son, Esha, much of her music has attempted to bring some sense of the momentous and awe-inspiring nature of birth-giving (and hence motherhood), into her work. Most recently, Susan has immersed herself in contemplation on the nature of Western Civilization, through deep study of Theology, Ancient Greek, Latin and Gregorian Chant. Susan has studied with, and been influenced by composers John Rimmer, Barry Vercoe, Barry Connyngham, Iannis Xenakis, Barry Truax; and priest and theologian Kevin McKone. As a recent convert to Catholicism, she is currently exploring the lively, turbulent and sometimes fraught relationship between the Catholic Church, the arts and society. Her music has been recorded for the label Earsay, available at earsay.com. Early works were recorded for Underwich Editions - Toronto.   Susan is a member of the Centre for New Zealand Music, The Canadian Music Centre, The World Forum of Acoustic Ecology and the Canadian Electroacoustic Community. She has a Masters degree from SFU (Simon Fraser University, Canada), and has received commissions and grants through the Ontario Arts Council and the Canada Council from some of Canada's leading performers. She taught for seven years in the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University, has been a regular guest lecturer at The Ontario College of Art, Toronto, and Emily Carr College, Vancouver, and taught Electroacoustic Music at Auckland University in 1989.   Her CDs are available from earsay.com     "

He graduated from Wellington Polytechnic in 1978 with the Certificate in Executant Music (Violin), and from Victoria University of Wellington in 1982 with a B.Mus.(Composition).  Keay has been a freelance musician since 1983, as a composer, violin/viola performer and teacher in both composition and performance.  He has held the following 12 month composer residencies: Mozart Fellow, University of Otago 1986 and 1987, Nelson School of Music Composer in Residence 1988 and 89, Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra Composer in Residence 1995.  His professional playing experience includes: Dunedin Sinfonia (violin and viola) since 1985, Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra (Associate violist) since 1994, Blue String Quartet (violist) 1993-94. The composer has been awarded the following; First Prize in Composition (1982) - Victoria University of Wellington Department of Music, Philip Neill Memorial Prize in Composition (1985) University of Otago.  Nigel Keay's writing was, during the 80's, typically atonal as well as abstract, and used a variety of instrumental forces ranging from solo and chamber music combinations to full symphony orchestra. Since the beginning of the 90's, the composers music has often concentrated on larger scale forms (operatic and symphonic) while using tonality in a contemporary style. At the same time, he has drawn on extra-musical associations based on literary and philosophical ideas, sometimes resulting in very specific images. Keay's music respects the Western Art music tradition, and the potential of orchestral colour and texture, but also admits a range of influences which have their origins in styles of music often linked to rock and jazz. There is always an overriding concern with the structural integrity of the form coupled with rhythmic energy and strong linear and timbral differentiation.

  profile_other: "  LOCKWOOD Annea (Anna) (b Christchurch 29 July 1939).  Composer, performer and teacher.  Having emerged with first-class honours in music from the somewhat staid academic background of Canterbury, Annea Lockwood within a few years found herself a controversial figure in the world's musical press.  She was the lady who pioneered a glass concert in London, burned pianos on Battersea Bridge, drowned an upright piano in a lake in Amarillo, Texas and summoned the ghost of Beethoven at a seance, - which suggested that Beethoven was a posthumous avant-garde composer.  She grew up in Christchurch where her mother, an amateur musician, choreographer and theatrical, \"encouraged with real joy the slightest signs of creativity\".  This included teaching her daughter to write down tunes she had made up and taking her to Gwen Moon, a fine teacher and pianist, whose husband Ron ran a childrens' string orchestra comprising his pupils.  Annea became their pianist, so that by the age of 13 she was writing pieces for strings and piano in various combinations: \" not a child prodigy, but a lucky child receiving good, solid training and a pragmatic education\".  Vernon Griffiths saw her works and 'invariably gave warm, uncondescending and thorough critiques'.  She majored in composition at Canterbury University, encouraged by Griffiths and John Ritchie. \"The range of styles to which I was exposed, however was limited directly by the innate conservatism of Christchurch musical life and I felt this consciously.  My first hearing of Webern's music didn't come until within a week of sailing for England, when a writer friend played me a recording.  It was the most radiocal music I'd heard.\"  At the Royal College of Music on a NZ Arts Council Bursary she studied composition with Paul Racine Fricker, who encouraged her to write large-scale pieces such as an atonal and rather expressionist Violin Concerto, subsequently performed by Frederick Grinke in the Commonwealth Arts Festival of 1964.  Her teacher \" was generously and professionally supportive of his students and pointed me in the direction of Darmstadt in 1962\".  She had piano lessons from Kendall Taylor: \"a superb analyst in a wide range of styles who taught me much, revealing the excitement of analysis.\"  She became interested in electronic music which she found a \"great vehicle through which to rethink the nature of musical parameters\", and studied at the old CEM Studio in Bilthoven, Holland.  From 1963-4 she took classes in instrumental composition in Cologne, heard a magnificent series of new music concerts by West Deutscher Rundfunk, and studied with Koenig, whose \"very precise organisational mind provided fine teaching of structural aspects, and working in the CEM studios opened up all those alternative fields of sound sources\".  It proved the most productive year of her musical education.  By 1965 she had heard much of the music and ideas of Cage, Feldman, La Monte Young and Christian Wolff, Cage's influence being a 'final catalyst', although the combined effect of all, influenced her for the next five years or so.  With an Icelandic composer, Atli Sveinsson, she began giving two piano concerts of his repertoire.  At that point she dismissed electronic sound generation as being too static and simple in a timbral sense - although she had not then heard American electronic music - \"already moving in different directions... Pondering over the differences between synthesised and acoustic timbres got me thinking that the latter may have more and subtler transients than the former.  I prescribed for myself an ear-training course which might enable me to create, by synthesis, sounds of equal complexity, and decided to work with just one sound at a time, which lead me straight to the glass concerts.  These were grossly conceived as glass smashing extravaganzas in New Zealand, a perception which still lingers.  May I clarify?  Glass was chosen because timbrally it is very resonant and had not been explored, so that its sounds would be fresh, free of any traditional contextual associations (ie.musical ones). Original thinking had a high value for me, as for Cage and others.  The concerts were partly theatre, and partly a rather ascetic minimalist piece, a little ahead of their period in their minimal insistence on one sound at a time.\"  (The score was published by SOURCE, No. 5 (Davis, California 1971).  The Downstage performances in 1967 brought \"incomprehension and derision\": the best reactions occurred at the Fylkingen Festival of 1970 and New York in 1973.  \"In general, as time pased, the work's premises seemed more and more intelligible and worthwhile to audiences and the piece lasted in people's memories and references.\"  With the glass concerts, the Piano Transplants, the first installation works and sound sculptures, she had moved away from traditional forms and styles and was on the way to discovering her strongest motivating force for the next 15 years - environmental sounds and their sonic linkage with her childhood experiences of the New Zealand alps around Arthur's Pass in Canterbury. \"The latter have been, to my mind, the strongest and most sustained influence of all; the unconsciously learned lessons imparted by the long rhythms of change, environmental change; environmental vulnerabilities and human rhythms.  In this respect I feel myself most strongly a New Zealand composer...\".  During this period she developed a number of installations and performance works focused on environmental sounds, taped life-stories and low-tech devices such as her Sound Ball, in works such as World Rhythms ('75), Conversations with the Ancestors ('75, an installation and performance work presenting the life-stories of four women in their 90s),A Sound Map of the Hudson River ('82, installation), Delta Run ('82, a performance work built around a conversation with sculptor, Walter Wincha who was dying of cancer), and a mixed-media performance piece based on the Sound Ball.  Three Short Stories and an Apotheosis ('85). In synchronous homage to Christian Barnard's first heart transplants, Lockwood created the Piano Transplants, (1969-72) in which old, defunct pianos were variously burned, 'drowned' in a shallow pond in Texas, and partially buried in an English garden.  In the mid-'80s she turned to acoustic instruments and voices in works ranging from a mezzo soprano lament I Give You Back (93 pub. Waiteata Press), to ensemble pieces such as Thousand Year Dreaming ('91), scored for 4 didjeridus, 2 conches, winds, trombones, frame drums, percussion and slide projections of images from the Lascaux Caves; Monkey Trips, a collaboration with the California EAR Unit (1995). In that year she also explored microtonality for the first time in Western Spaces, premiered in New York by Newband. Recent works include Shapeshifter ('96), for the American Symphony Chamber Orchestra; Tongues of Fire, Tongues ('97), for 8 female voices and percussion; two piano works: Red Mesa ('89 pub. Waiteata Press), and Ear-Walking Woman ('96), for prepared piano, commissioned by Lois Svard.  Lockwood lives with her partner, composer Ruth Anderson, in Crompond, New York and continues to teach composition and theory at Vassar College, New York, where she has been on the faculty since 1985. Her music is recorded and currently available on the following American labels: Lovely Music, CRI, Opus One, non Sequitor/ What Next?, Atlantic/ Finnadar, XI and on Rattle Records (NZ).

She moved away from traditional forms and styles and was on the way to discovering her strongest motivating force for the next 15 years - environmental sounds and their sonic linkage with her childhood experiences of the New Zealand alps around Arthur's Pass in Canterbury, New Zealand.    In the mid-80s she turned to acoustic instruments and voices  and recent works include Shapeshifter ('96), for the American Symphony Chamber Orchestra; Tongues of Fire, Tongues ('97), for 8 female voices and percussion and two piano works, Red Mesa ('89 pub. Waiteata Press), and Ear-Walking Woman ('96).  Lockwood lives with her partner, composer Ruth Anderson, in Crompond, New York and continues to teach composition and theory at Vassar College, New York, where she has been on the faculty since 1985.  ---  ANNEA LOCKWOOD Born in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1939 and living in the United States since 1973, Annea Lockwood is known for her explorations of natural acoustic sounds and environments, in works ranging from sound art and installations, through text-sound and performance art to concert music. Her music has been performed in many venues and festivals including: the American Century:1950 � 2000 exhibition at the Whitney Museum, De Ijsbreker, Amsterdam, the Other Minds Festival, San Francisco, the Walker Art Center, Cincinatti, the Los Angeles County Museum, Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room, London, the Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Cologne, the Palais des Beaux Arts, Brussels, CNMAT, Berkeley, the Asia-Pacific Festival, Wellington, Donaufest 2006, Ulm, Germany, the 7th Totally Huge New Music Festival and Ruined Piano Convergence, Perth, Australia and An Ear To The Earth Festival, New York. In �05 she completed a four-year project, the sound installation, 'A Sound Map of the Danube', which was premiered in the Donau Festival in Krems a.d. Donau, Austria, in April, �05. This is a \"sound map\" of the entire Danube River (in surround sound), incorporating a wide variety of water, animal and underwater insect sounds, rocks from the riverbed and the voices of those whose lives are intimately connected to the river. Other recent projects include 'Jitterbug', commissioned by the Merce Cunningham Dance Company for 6 channel soundscape and two improvising musicians; Bow Falls, a collaboration with video artist Paul Ryan; 'Ceci n�est pas un piano', for piano, video and electronics commissioned by Jennifer Hymer; Vortex, for the Bang on a Can All-Stars ensemble, 'Wai Pounamu', an electroacoustic collaboration with Richard Nunns, and 'Luminescence', a song cycle for baritone Thomas Buckner and the SEM Ensemble. Since 1970 her music has been issued on British, American and Australasian record labels and has been published by Schirmers, Waiteata Press (New Zealand), Smith Publications and in European and American journals. Her undergraduate composition studies were with John Ritchie and Vernon Griffiths at the University of Canterbury. She went on to study with Peter Racine Fricker at the Royal College of Music, London; with G.M.Koenig at the CEM Studio, Bilthoven and at the Musikhochschule, Cologne; and at the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, Southampton University, England. She is a Professor Emerita of Vassar College, where she was on the faculty from 1985 until 2001, and has an Honorary Doctorate from Clark University, Massachusetts. She has received awards and fellowships from the Gulbenkian Foundation, the Arts Council of Great Britain, the National Endowment for the Arts, Arts International and the American Music Center's Henry Cowell Award.

  profile: "Born in Auckland, son of John Maconie, sub-editor and film critic of the New Zealand Listener (d. 1963) and Janet nee McBride. Brought up and educated in Lower Hutt, attending Hutt Valley High School 1955-59. Studied piano with Christina Geel; school music teachers included Stanley Jackson and Peter Crowe, who encouraged his interest in composition. Attended Cambridge Summer Music Schools from 1957 to 1962, studying with Ron Tremain.  Maconie was active as a composer at Victoria University 1960-63 and encouraged by Frederick Page to pursue postgraduate study of contemporary music in Europe. As a student he also collaborated with Hamish Keith, later Tony Williams in creating scores for experimental short films, leading to the feature Runaway (1964) dir. John O'Shea, composed on study leave in Vienna. After a semester attending Messiaen's analysis class at the Paris Conservatoire, he moved to Cologne 1964-65 on a DAAD studentship, studying with Stockhausen, Eimert, Zimmermann, Aloys Kontarsky and others. Prior to the official inauguration of the Cologne Musikhochschule electronic studio, directed by Eimert, he produced \"Metres\" and \"Fragments,\" some of the first electronic music to be composed by a New Zealander. Some of this music is incorporated in Pacific Films' \"Who will be the Next Statistic,\" a 1966 road safety film.  His compositions reflect a broad interest in classical and contemporary issues. In 1984, having reached as far as he could go at the time with electronic, chance, and computer music, Maconie turned to the task of developing a new comprehensive approach to musical aesthetics, capable of reconciling the multiple ideologies of contemporary music, a goal including the production of music textbooks for New Zealand schools. He now looks forward to resuming full-time composing and is happy to respond to expressions of interest from individuals or groups. Robin Maconie is co-author of 'Stockhausen on Music' (1989) and author of 'The Concept of Music' (1990), 'The Science of Music' (1997), 'The Second Sense' (2002), 'Other Planets: the Music of Karlheinz Stockhausen' (2005), and 'The Way of Music' (2007). He returned to New Zealand in 2002 and lives in Dannevirke. (June 2007)"

  profile: "Born in Wellington in 1941, Jenny McLeod grew up in Timaru and Levin. Throughout her childhood and adolescence she was always involved in music, as school pianist, church organist, accompanist, or playing at dances in a band with her brothers.  She enrolled at Victoria University in 1961, studying music with Frederick Page, David Farquhar and Douglas Lilburn.  Her portfolio of compositions at the completion of her B.Mus. degree included 'Epithalamia'.  After hearing a recording of 'Quartet for the End of Time', McLeod resolved to go to Paris to study with Messiaen, whose generous mentorship made a lasting impression on her and resulted in a life-long friendship.  After Paris, she moved on to study with Boulez in Basel, and then with Stockhausen and Berio in Cologne, where she wrote 'For Seven' (1966).  This work attracted critical attention with performances by Stockhausen's ensemble, and at the New Music Festival in Darmstadt and the Berlin Festival, conducted by Bruno Maderna.  While in Cologne, an environment she did not particularly enjoy, Jenny McLeod \"discovered\" Richard Taylor's translation of the Maori creation poetry, in the Penguin Book of New Zealand Verse, which she had taken with her on her travels.  Returning to Wellington and a lectureship at Victoria University, she commenced work on 'Earth and Sky', a large work of music-theatre for performance by school children, based on this poetry.  The work made a significant contribution to the nation's burgeoning bi-culturalism, and established Jenny McLeod at the rising star of New Zealand music. In 1971 she was appointed Professor at Victoria University, remarkable on two counts - as a woman and as being just twenty-nine years old.  Although 'Under the Sun' was not the success of its predecessor 'Earth and Sky', it was on an even larger scale, and stimulated a new direction in her music.   'Under the Sun' incorporated a rock band, and after a \"jam session\" with the band, McLeod became convinced that rock music, as well as non-Western music, had qualities she found lacking in Western art music. As she investigated these musics, she also began to read Hindu and Buddhist philosophy.  A growing interest in spiritual matters led her to join the Divine Light Mission in 1975.  Her compositional activities by now focused on \"devotional rock music\" for bands associated with the Mission.  Feeling she had lost her commitment to teaching, she resigned from the University in 1976, and for the next five years she worked as a volunteer for the Divine Light Mission in Auckland, Australia, and the United States.  Experiences in the States however led to disillusionment, and she returned to New Zealand in 1981. A commission from the Bach Choir of Wellington to write 'Childhood' (1981), using her own poems, was the first in a stream of commissions McLeod received over the next few years.  In these pieces she integrated of the language of popular music in an attempt to reveal its \"classicism\".  However, by 1987, with works such as the 'Rock Sonatas' I and II for piano, McLeod felt she had reached the limit of what this stylistic synthesis was capable. Fortuitously, at this time of creative questioning, she was invited to a contemporary music festival in Louisville, Kentucky, where 'For Seven' was performed.  Here she met the Dutch composer Peter Schat, who introduced her to his \"Tone Clock\" theory.  McLeod became fascinated with this new systematic classification of triads, and immersed herself in a study of its theory and applications.  This resulted in her translating into English Schat's book on the subject, and her developing the theory to a point far beyond that envisaged by its original author.  'Tone Clock Pieces' for piano (1988-89) was the natural creative outcome, as she applied the theory as a stimulus for compositon. In 1993 a new direction was set by He Iwi Kotahi Tatou for Maori and Pakeha choirs, the beginning of a close association with Maori culture.  McLeod became a member of Ngati Rangi, and regularly wrote hymns for the Maori churches.  In 1998 she became involved with her local church in Pukerua Bay, playing the organ as well as writing hymns and sacred songs for them.  Most recently she converted to Roman Catholicism.  Jenny McLeod is considered one of the most naturally gifted of all New Zealand composers - she could read music at age five, and, before attending University, was essentially self-taught.  In the opinion of one of her colleagues she has always had the intelligence and ability to make a success of any enterprise she put her mind to. Clearly one of the major paths in her life has been a search for spiritual meaning, whether through the cosmic questions posed 'Under the Sun', her devotional rock music for the Divine Light Mission, her writings for the Christian communities to whom she has been attached in recent years, or her choice to retire to a quiet, almost meditative life-style. Something of her strength of character may be judged from her embracing of the \"Tone Clock Theory\" as an intellectual as well as musical challenge. Over a period of several years she has compiled a large body of theoretical work on the subject.  Having researched the subject exhaustively, however, she has now put it aside for other interests, and feels no particular ambition to press for this material to be published.  Her career has been a remarkable procession of extraordinary changes of direction, periods of intensive creative activity interspersed with periods of inactivity, and stylistic volte faces - one moment radical avant-gardism, then popular music.  However, she now moves with ease between different musical worlds - \"serious\" music, popular music, music for the church, and for Maori communities. (July 2007)"

  profile: "Christopher Norton was born in New Zealand in 1953. He began composing at the age of 14, and, by the age of 16, had an orchestral work performed and broadcast. Having completed an honours degree in music from Otago University, Dunedin, in 1974, Chris met with some success as a pianist in New Zealand, playing with the New Zealand Symphony orchestra and broadcasting on the Concert Programme. At the same time, he was teaching music in local high schools, beginning to freelance as a composer and arranger, and had also started to play keyboards in a rock band, having becoming interested in jazz and pop.

In 1983, Chris was signed by Boosey & Hawkes and the first of the Microjazz series appeared -music which appealed greatly to children and teenagers but was sufficiently rooted in the classical tradition to be useful as teaching material. The series has expanded over 20 years to include music for all of the major instruments with piano, ensemble books and midi file backings. It is now the biggest selling music series for Boosey & Hawkes, with over a million sales to date. Christopher Norton is now well established as a composer, producer, arranger and educationalist and has written stage musicals, ballet scores, piano music, popular songs and orchestral music as well as jingles and signature tunes for TV and radio.

  profile_other: "SMALLEY, DENIS  Denis Smalley was born in Nelson, New Zealand in 1946.  He studied for his first degree in music at the University of Canterbury, followed by a first class hounours degree in composition at the Victoria University of Wellington.  He was active as a recital organist giving the first New Zealand performances of music by Messiaen and Ligeti.  On leaving university he was Head of Music at Wellington College for almost three years before being awarded a French Government Bursary for further study in France.  In Paris he joined Olivier Messiaen's composition class at the Paris Conservatoire.  At the same time he studied electro-acoustic music composition with the Groupe de Recherches Musicales and completed the Diplome de Musique Elecroacoustique et de Recherche Musicale (Paris Conservatoire).  In 1972 he moved to York, England, reading for the Doctor of Philosophy in Composition at the University of York.  In 1976 he was appointed Lecturer in Music at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, where he is now Senior Lecturer.  He is Director of the Electro-acoustic Music Studios.  Denis Smalley's works are all electro-acoustic, some of them involving instruments and voices.  His music first drew international attention when he won the Fylkingen Prize in Sweden in 1975.  Since that time his works have been performed and broadcast in more than 25 countries, and have received a number of international awards - the Bourges Electro-acoustic Awards (France), the Special Prize of the International Confederation of  Electro-acoustic Music, NewComp (USA), the Bourges Euphonie d'Or - culminating in the prestigious Prix Ars Electronica (Austria) in 1988.  He has worked extensively in electro-acoustic facilities in a number of countries including the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (Institut Natonal de l'Audiovisuel, Paris), IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique, Paris), the Computer Systems Research Institute at the University of Toronto, the Banff Centre for the Arts (Canada) and Finnish Radio Experimental Studio.  In his publications, lectures and international conference papers he has made original contributions to thought about contemporary music, in particular his investigations into the listener's perception and interpretation of electro-acoustic music, and his development of the concept of spectro-morphology (the shaping of sound spectra through time).

Various commissions from Chamber Music New Zealand, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts and Radio New Zealand have been performed nationwide and also in the United States, Europe and Australia.  (Above biography from Edinburgh 2001 programme)  KENNETH YOUNG Kenneth Young regards himself as fortunate in having been commissioned by various orchestras and artistic organisations, including the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra (\"Symphonies 1 and 2\", \"Sinfonietta\", \"Dance\", \"Brass Quintet\"), Auckland Philharmonia (\"Piano Concerto\"), Southern Sinfonia (\"Concertino for Horn and Orchestra\"), Wellington Youth Orchestra (\"Virgen de la Esperanza\"), International Festival of the Arts (\"Variations\"), and Chamber Music New Zealand (\"Fantasy for Two Pianos\", \"String Quartet\", \"Vignette\" for brass trio, \"Five Pieces\" for piano, \"Sextet\" for string quartet, clarinet and piano).  His development as a composer began as a 15 year old while attending Cashmere High School in Christchurch where he came under the influence of his music teacher, Frank Dennis, who sensed an ability beyond Young's involvement with the brass band movement (an interest he still maintains), encouraging him to write, conduct, and embark on a course of serious music study.  Young began playing both tuba and percussion with the Christchurch Symphony and National Youth Orchestra while studying composition at Canterbury and Auckland Universities, eventually being appointed Principal Tuba of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, a position which gave him the financial independence to freely pursue composition and conducting.  In 2004, Young was awarded a Lilburn Trust Citation Award for Outstanding Services to New Zealand Music.  (Biography submitted for SOUNZ Contemporary Award 2005)     "

Ray is affiliated with SOCAN (the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada), an Associate Member of the Canadian Music Centre and a member of the Canadian League of Composers, the Centre for the Promotion of Contemporary Composers (CPCC), and New Zealand's SOUNZ.  Ray has composed close to a hundred musical compositions. His portfolio includes works for symphony and chamber orchestras, concert band, opera, vocal and chamber groups, solo instruments and various choral combinations. He has released six CD's so far. Another three to four are in production. His music, which is always carefully crafted, speaks in an idiom that is both approachable and deeply personal. His musical language centers around a unique harmonic essence underlying a wonderful melodic inventiveness. Ray's music, with its tight formal structure, alludes to our rich western heritage combined with the expressive freedom of the 20th century. His sonic palette is widely ranging in timbral variety while conservative in melodic content. In addition to his activities as a composer, Ray was involved in the investment field as a broker and an Investment Advisor with the Royal Bank's Dominion Securities Ltd., one of Canada's largest investment banking firms, until his recent retirement. He is a Fellow of the Canadian Securities Institute. He has two sons who are also very active in various creative endeavours.

His first trip to Europe in 1987 was to perform at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival with legendary Greek polymath Iannis Xenakis using UPIC, an early electronic music system. In 1990 his Aotea Centre-opening orchestral performance The Good Seeds Are So Small, performed by the APO and broadcast by Radio New Zealand, was proclaimed concert of the year by seminal music magazine Rip It Up. Having received an AGC Young Achievers Award in 1989, Blair moved to the Netherlands where he studied electronic music and classical composition with Louis Andriessen, and earned a NUFFIC scholarship from the Dutch Government. In 1991 Blair moved from Den Haag to London. Inspired by 4AD groups Dead Can Dance (featuring Lisa Gerrard) and This Mortal Coil, he began diversifying into the wider realms of pop music and formed the band 'glory box'. Blair has given concerts in the UK and Europe, including London�s prestigious South Bank Centre in 1994. His recording career includes material for Phonogram Records (glory box, 1995) as well as orchestral arrangements for ambient techno terrorist Scanner (1997) and the group Mandalay (V2 Records, 1998) � a role that saw him working alongside Madonna/Bjork producer Guy Sigsworth. Reviews have appeared in The Times, NME, Wired and GQ, with radio support coming from BBC Radio 1 and Kiss FM, to name a few. Blair has composed soundtracks and sound design for Gordon�s Gin, Mastercard, Sky TV and NZ Navy TVCs, as well as working on the film Stargate, the Nintendo game Cartoon Academy, and multimedia presentations for Signpost and Australian Fashion Week for Karen Walker. Returning to New Zealand in the late 90s, Blair spent a few years lecturing at Auckland University, where originally he earned his Master�s degree in Music (MMus - 1st class,1987). Most importantly, Blair is now writing his own music again. With 15 years first-hand research into pop culture behind (and presumably still in front of) him, Blair felt compelled to write \"Accordian\", rediscovering the territory that had captivated him in the late '80s � an amalgamation of contemporary classical music with elements of electronic pop culture. \"Accordian\" is an exploration of duality and symmetry, and demonstrates a fascination with structure, form & shape. It uses Blair's new mosaic form, based on making cells visible or invisible depending on the shape imposed over them - the shape in this case being the metaphorical concept of an accordion. This highly anticipated fusion of pop culture and contemporary classical music was released on CD in July 2006. Harp, the accompanying single is now available for free download, along with a video by Amber de Boer, from www.amplifier.co.nz . (June 2007)"

His composition aims for a deep-felt emotion and Christian spiritual sensibility linking heaven and earth. The music is informed by Filipino percussion ensembles, Korean traditional music and free-form jazz; these are placed within a European influenced architectural design. Crossman's Pacific-based aesthetic has been influenced by Peter Sculthorpe, Chou Wen-chung and Chinary Ung. Several works of Crossman explore this Pacific identity, including 'Daragang Magayon Cantata' (2001) and 'Fierce Tranquillity' (2004). The former was written in collaboration with Filipina-Australian poet Merlinda Bobis and explores Filipino percussive rhythms and chant using virtuosic performance resources, whilst the latter composition explores a Korean gestural approach alongside Japanese shakuhachi techniques adapted to string writing. Crossman has won a number of awards, including the Queensland Philharmonic's Corbould Prize (1996) as well as commendations in the Albert H. Maggs Award (2004) (Melbourne University) and in the Foundation Orchestra's International Composition Competition (2004) (United States). He has also been awarded a Composition Fellowship at the Pacific Music Festival (1990) in Japan and the Mozart Fellowship (1992) at Otago University.

  profile: "Hamilton Dickson (1906 - 1980) was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, where early in his musical career he became involved with theatre performances. As a cellist he played in silent picture orchestras from the age of twelve. In his teenage years he conducted an orchestra for ballet recitals in which his sister Jessie Dickson was one of the leading ballerinas. His desire to teach the voice and  to develop his ability with composition  came in the years  of study at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music  in 1933-34.  Here he worked under Alfred Hill for composition and Roland Foster for voice. Hamilton Dickson performed regularly as a cellist in both the Sydney Conservatorium of Music Orchestra and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra throughout this period.  In 1935 Hamilton Dickson married professional pianist Eileen Decima Hughson. Decima Dickson performed regularly on the YA and YC radio networks for over 40 years from the earliest beginning of radio in Christchurch in 1928 until she retired in 1971 at the age of 65 years. This musical partnership, firstly with performances of cello and piano works in public recitals and radio broadcasts endeared Decima and Hamilton Dickson to a national audience. Compositions written by Hamilton Dickson in the 1930s included many works for piano, and for cello and piano which they both enjoyed performing. 'A Country Suite', a set of  3 solos for piano is particularly notable. Several cello solos include 'Arietta' in A minor, and 'Romance in F Major'. Once established as a singing teacher in Wellington in 1935, Hamilton Dickson (or H.D. as he was affectionately called by many of his students over the next  45 years,) became completely dedicated to the needs of his students. After the 2nd World War, his studio was the scene of many concerts with successful singing students gaining experience in these early performances before launching into careers in New Zealand and overseas. During the 1950s and '60s he enjoyed conducting concert version performances of popular light operas of the day with his students singing  as soloists and members of the chorus, with full orchestral accompaniment. Following this, for nine years he conducted annual performances for the Wellington Gilbert and Sullivan Society. Further compositions included 2 Sets of Preludes for piano, written as birthday presents to Decima in 1944 and 1946. Many songs written for students during the 1950s included 'Tears', 'Alone',  and  'A Phantasy'. Hamilton Dickson was frequently asked to adjudicate the vocal sections at competition festivals around New Zealand. His sympathetic and detailed report sheets were cherished by many a competitor and were frequently referred to - some reappearing years later amongst memorabilia. In the last ten years of his life Hamilton Dickson suffered with increasing ill-health, but continued to teach singing and advanced theory of music until 8 hours before his death. He passed away peacefully in his sleep  at the age of 73 years, leaving his current students in a state of disbelief at what appeared to them to be an unexpected death.

He was named after his godfather who was an organist and Philip followed in his footsteps.  Music was an important part of the family's life and Philip showed an early aptitude and keenness, first learning the piano for three years from his mother, before going to Wanganui Collegiate in Form Three, where he learned piano from Gordon McBeth.  When the family moved to Dunedin in 1953, Philip started piano lessons with Maurice Till, with whom he continued for five years while he was also studying at Otago University.   He was organist and choirmaster at his father's church at Holy Cross in St Kilda. Parishioners enjoyed his playing so much that some came early to church to listen to his voluntaries.  In 1957 Philip completed both the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Music with Second Class Honours.  He was awarded the Sterne Prize for Stage Two English in December 1957 and the Philip Neill Memorial Prize for Composition in December 1958.  Part of  this prize should have been a performance;  however there was no-one in New Zealand at the time with the technique to play it.  For a year and a half, Philip laboured in a factory to pay back a teaching studentship he did not wish to pursue, and to save his fare to London.

Cheryl has been employed as a lecturer and tutor in composition, theory and orchestration at Auckland University. She has also worked extensively as a composer in schools, and in 1993+4 was employed by the Arts Council of New Zealand as their Composer In Schools, firstly in Auckland, then Dunedin. She has developed many teaching and composing programmes to assist  students of all ages with their own compositions, and has presented workshops throughout New Zealand for teachers keen to include creative music-making in their programmes.  During 1996, Cheryl was the Mozart Fellow (a fellowship for established composers) at Otago University in Dunedin, and not only to composed several pieces requested of her by various performers, but also continued working in schools around the Otago region. During the year she won the Philip Neill Memorial Prize for \"The Burns Songs\" (soprano, clarinet and cello) and was commissioned by Pocket Opera of Wellington to produce a short opera, premiered in their 1997 season \"Opera Bites\".  From 1998 to 2002, Cheryl worked in a primary school in Brisbane, Australia as a music and arts specialist, but maintained links with New Zealand through researching and writing teaching resources for the Centre for New Zealand Music, and by composing several choral pieces for New Zealand schools. Cheryl is currently resident in Northumberland, England. Recent projects have included composing a song cycle with drama and dance for school children in Sunderland about their local river entitled \"Winter Wear\", working with  senior citizens and a poet at The Sage Gateshead to produce a song cycle about the participants' lives, and producing a Stravinsky Week extravaganza in a local primary school the culmination of which were performances by all 300 children in the school of three of that composer's most famous ballets.

  profile_other: "Alfred Hill (1870-1960) was New Zealand's first fully professional composer and a leading figure in Australian music from the early years of this century. With his artistic life divided between Australia and New Zealand, he is best described as a true Australasian who was virtually the founder of musical composition in the two countries in which he lived. As a young man he was much involved in Wellington's musical life, and after studying in Leipzig, became conductor of the Wellington Orchestral Society. His move to Australia soon after the turn of the century saw him co-found the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and become one of its professors. At this time he composed the romantic operas 'Tapu' and 'A Moorish Maid'. Best known for many years as the composer of the popular song 'Waiata Poi', Alfred Hill also wrote thirteen symphonies, seven concertos, seven operas, string quartets, suites, sonatas, cantatas, numerous songs and a considerable amopunt of film music. In his influence and in his fervour for music he is a major antipodean musical figure.

  profile: "(pianist/composer)  Dan was born in Wellington, NZ.  His first major musical recognition came while at school when he won the Composition Prize at the 1983 National Westpac School Music Competition. In 1986 he was a finalist in the TVNZ Young Musician's Competition and the National Christchurch Concerto Competition.  In 1988 he was awarded first prize in the National Kerikeri Piano Competition. After study in New Zealand and postgraduate study in Australia, Dan spent several years travelling the world. In 1997, Dan re-established his reputation and career with his CD of NZ piano music called \"you hit him he cry out\" (Rattle Records) which won the Classical Award in the 1998 NZ Music Awards. A pianist and composer he is known as the champion of NZ music and is in significant demand throughout Australasia and Asia, especially for his solo piano performances and more recently, with the developing associations with New Zealand Soprano Deborah Wai Kapohe and German Soprano Sylvia Nopper. Dan was chosen as the sole NZ representative to perform a concert of NZ music in June '99 at the Sydney Opera House as part of the International Association of Music Information Centres' Conference. Dan began 2001 with performances in the Chamber Music Festival in Nelson, and the Bangkok New Music Festival. During the year, he gave many concerts throughout New Zealand and also performed with Sylvia Nopper in Malaysia, New Zealand, Germany and Switzerland. He ended the year performing in India, Germany, London and to critical acclaim in the New Music New Zealand Festival in Edinburgh, and the Ijsbreker Festival in Amsterdam. In 2002 Dan toured under the auspices of Chamber Music New Zealand with both his solo programme and as part of the group Under Construction. He has also been involved in a number of recording projects. In 2003 Dan performs in the Sonorities Festival In Ireland followed by performances in Scotland, England, Germany and Switzerland along with various projects in New Zealand. "
  profile_other: "Dan Poynton was born in Wellington NZ in 1965.  He started playing the piano at 10, and went on to study compositio with Jack Body and perfromance with Judith Clark at Victoria university's School of music.  He also studied post-graduate piano with Alexander Semetsky at the VCA in melbourne, Australia.  He has been a finalist in a number of competitions, including the TVNZ Young Musician's Competition and the 1986 National Concerto Competition in Christchurch.  In 1988 he was awarded first prize in the National Kerikeri piano Competition adjudicated by Michael Houstoun.  Despite his love for classical music, it is as an interpreter of New Zealand and other new music that his developing reputation is based.  Dan likes doing hatha yoga and throwing frisbees.  Born in 1965, in Wellington New Zealand, Dan Poynton started playing piano when he was ten. His first major musical recognition came while still at school, when he won the Composition First Prize in the 1983 National Westpac School Music Competition.He continued studying composition at Victoria University under Jack Body and David Farquhar, but majored in piano performance under Judith Clark, while  keeping up his love of languages studying Maori, German and French. In 1986 he appeared on television playing Brahms as a semi-finalist in the TVNZ Young Musicians' competition, and in that year was also a finalist in the National Christchurch Concerto Competition. It was in 1987, after giving a critically-acclaimed premier with Diane Cooper of the Three Rhythmics by Jack Body at the Sonic Circus, Wellington, that his involvement in contemporary (especially New Zealand) music took off. However, Dan's love of classical music has never diminished, and in 1988 he won First Prize in the National Kerikeri Piano Competition. Michael Houstoun, adjudicator for the competition, described Dan as \" a highly imaginative musician who has the ability to convey his enjoyment of the music to the audience.\"  In 1989 the Northern Regional Arts Council commissioned Dan to do a series of solo tours, playing everywhere from Auckland to small towns like Opotiki. He played a variety of music, from classical to new American and New Zealand music (including his own compositions), giving informal talks about the music in between playing. He was struck by how open audiences both young and old could be to new music, even in places which were not  'cultural centres,' when the music was played passionately, juxtaposed with better-known classical works, and given a contexturalising introduction.  Dan continued to play in various venues and for Concert FM after this, and his reputation as an 'accessible' player of new music led to him being invited to play at such gigs as Wellington's 1989 Jazz at the St James with Jonathan Crayford, Bruno Lawrence, Beaver and international jazzmen Larry Gales and Bernie McGann.  In 1990, Dan moved to Melbourne where he studied post-graduate piano at the Victoria College of the Arts, concentrating once again on classical repertoire. Then, in an effort to escape the rigours of the musical world for a while, and to get his O.E., Dan travelled through Asia, Europe and North Africa. Three years later the musical itch became too strong and he returned to New Zealand to continue his musical career.  Since 1994 he has mainly been involved in the playing of New Zealand and other new music, because of a desire to bring this often neglected music to the people it was written for - before it's too late! Recently, he has also been a prominent player in Extravacanza, the Victoria University New Music and Lunchtime Concert series, the Douglas Lilburn 80th Birthday Tribute Concert, and on Concert FM.  His repertoire currently includes classical, 20th century and New Music, especially from Asia and 'pioneering' countries such as North America and New Zealand. "

  profile: " Pianist, composer, band leader and jazz educator Mike Nock, came to Australia from New Zealand in the late 1950s where he quickly established himself as a musician in demand in Sydney and Melbourne jazz clubs and nightclubs and as a member of the highly regarded Three Out Trio. It would be difficult to find in either country a jazz musician who accumulated the depth of international experience he has since that time. After  his  first  recordings   in Australia with  the Three-Out Trio in  1960-61, he then went to England and worked in top London jazz establishments before taking up a scholarship to study at  Berklee in the United States. He spent the following 25 years in the United States, working with a diverse group of legendary musicians including Dionne Warwick, Coleman Hawkins, Yusef Lateef etc., establishing his leadership credentials through many critically acclaimed recordings. It was here also that he formed the electronic fusion group The Fourth Way, which became widely known and influenced many American bands. Widely recognised for his abilities, Mike's honours include: the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to jazz (2003), a two year Australian Arts Council Fellowship (1999-2001),  three USA National Endowment Awards for composition (1972, 1975, 1978 ), New Zealand Jazz Record of the Year (1987 and 1989), three Australian Critics Awards (1991, 1992 and 1993), Australian contemporary CD of the year for his BigSmallBand LIVE (2004).

  profile_other: "New Zealand born pianist/composer Mike Nock is one of the acknowledged masters of jazz in Australasia.  Mike's reputation rests partly on his imposing international experience which includes: - some twenty-five years working in the USA with many of the world's top jazz musicians such as Coleman Hawkins, Yusef Lateef, Dionne Warwick, Michael Brecker, etc... - a large catalogue of critically acclaimed, internationally released recordings  - his role as leader of the 1960's seminal jazz-rock group The Fourth Way  - a substantial body of original compositions in print and on recordings. During 1968-70 Nock was involved with fusion, leading the Fourth Way, a pioneer in the idiom.  After a few years he became a studio musician in New York (1975-85) and then returned to Australia where he has been busy as both an educator (teaching at the N.S.W. Conservatorium of Music) and as a musician, occasionally revisiting the U.S..  In 1983 he hosted his own series on TVNZ 'Nock On Jazz' and in 1993 was the subject of a TVNZ documentary made on his life and music.  In 2003, Mike was awarded an ONZM for his services to Jazz.  Although primarily known as a jazz composer, Mike's compositions also include electronic soundscapes, choral pieces, and music for dance and film.  His music has been commissioned and performed by ensembles such as:  The New Zealand String Quartet, Dunedin Civic Orchestra, NZ Piano Quartet, Cleveland Chamber Symphony (USA), Australian Chamber Orchestra, Synergy, Melbourne Windpower, Ensemble 24 and Umo Jazz Orchestra (Finland).

Following war service in France, he graduated from Cambridge University and taught at Downside Schoool, Somerset and St Edmund's Christchurch Teachers' Training College in New Zealand and moved there in early 1927.   In Christchurch he established Saturday morning classes in music theory and instrumental playing to bring music within the reach of all. His scheme was extraordinarily successful. He also established and edited for four years \"Music in New Zealand\", the first national journal of its kind.  In 1933 he went to Dunedin to become Director of Music at the King Edward Technical Colllege. There he quickly established a part-singing choir involving the whole school, n addition to an orchetra of 100 or more and a full military band. He composed and arranged a huge repertoire of music appropriate to the abilities and interests of teenage students. His \"Dominion Song Books\" became a staple diet for schools throughout New Zealand.  An account of his work in Dunedin is given in \"An Experiment in School Music Making\" [1941, NZ Council of Education Research]. The Dunedin Scheme attracted world-wide attention.

In the twenty years he was there he led many reforms in academic teaching while retaining his interest in the community through industrial and rural music-making - including conducting a Railway Workshops Choir.

He went to Dunedin during the Depression, but returned to Christchurch in 1942 as Professor of Music at University College. His taste was conservative and anglocentric, but he was deeply committed to music as a viable and valued part of New Zealand society, not an opinion to be taken for granted by any means in New Zealand at the time.  He wrote much practical music for schools and colleges; also cantatas, three masses, various organ pieces and music for brass band.

After the war he won an organ scholarship to the University of Cambridge, where he was the Pembroke College organist from 1919 to 1922.  He gained a BA in history in 1921, and a MusB in 1922.

  profile: " Willow Macky is one of New Zealand's great, but largely unheralded composer of New Zealand songs.  It would be unusual to have attended an end of year school assembly in New Zealand in the last 40 years and not have sung her work \"Te Harinui - A New Zealand Carol\".  Of her prodigious output of over 113 songs and 92 lyrics, Willow wrote mostly folk songs, even a folk opera called \"The Maori Flute\".  She is a great exponent of writing about local experiences, history, people and places, including Maori legend and tradition.  In fact the reason she started writing songs was because while she had collected many folksongs from around the world, she couldn't find any about Auckland.  This led to \"Waitemata Harbour\", and later \"Tamaki Moonlight\".  Singing about her own city seems to have received a mixed reaction - in interview in 1994 she remembered people laughing when she sang the line \"I love to go down to old Mission Bay\" in \"Tamaki Moonlight\" because of the strangeness of hearing a local place mentioned in a ballad.  One of Willow's 'breaks' was meeting Swedish-American balladeer William Clauson on his visit to New Zealand in 1959.  He recorded five of Willow's songs, including one she wrote specially, set to a melody he particularly liked - it was a tradition for each country he visited to supply different words to the same tune.  That song was \"The Bishop and the Tohunga\". The great bass singer Inia Te Wiata praised Willow's songs as \"the only New Zealand composer besides Alfred Hill who can capture the authentic Maori atmosphere.\"  Willow's career spans the time when issues of cultural representation and sensitivity were coming to the fore.  By 1990 she had revised her 1964 composition \"Waitangi Anthem\", because she found \"as time went on I began to realise that the words of the anthem did not adequately reflect, in these changing times, the feelings of the Maori community about the Treaty.\" Willow's life and work are a valuable part of the story of New Zealand music.  As Willow observed over 40 years ago \"we have something to sing about - a land as beautiful, interesting and worthy as any other�we wish to pay [New Zealand] a tribute which is long overdue and give pleasure to our people and all others who wish to hear.\" Willow passed away on  9 December, 2006.

  profile: "James Gardner was born in Liverpool, England in 1962, and during the 1980s played keyboards for his group The Umbrella and thereafter for a variety of well-known artists, both live and in the studio, as well as writing and arranging music in many groups, including Pete Shelley's band and Howard Devoto's band Luxuria. In 1990 he co-founded the band and remix team Apollo 440, reworking tracks by artists such as U2 and Scritti Politti. From his mid-teens, writing notated music had formed a parallel stream to these activities, and in 1991 Gardner's virtuosic solo piano piece 'Shattered Blue Ground', played by Joanna MacGregor, was runner-up in the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival Composers' Competition. Following encouragement from Michael Finnissy, Gardner left Apollo 440 in 1993 in order to concentrate on composition, and in the same year attended Brian Ferneyhough's classes at the Viitasaari Summer Academy in Finland. Gardner moved to New Zealand in 1994, and became a New Zealand Citizen in February 2001. In 1996 he set up the contemporary music ensemble 175 East, of which he is currently director and occasional conductor. The group has since gained an international reputation and given many acclaimed world premiere performances of music by New Zealand and overseas composers and their concerts are frequently broadcast by Radio New Zealand Concert. Gardner's compositions have been played and broadcast throughout New Zealand as well as in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe, Asia and North and South America. In addition to his compositional work, Gardner is an active broadcaster on music, having written, compiled and presented well-received programmes on the music of John Cage, Brian Ferneyhough, Conlon Nancarrow, Iannis Xenakis, Frank Zappa and the James Bond soundtracks of John Barry, all for the wonderfully eclectic Radio New Zealand Concert.

  profile: "Miriama Young is a composer and sound artist of both instrumental and electronic works. She grew up in Wellington, New Zealand, and graduated with a B.A. in History and B.Mus. (Hons) in Composition from Victoria University of Wellington 1999. In 2000 she took up a Fulbright Graduate Award to pursue a Masters at New York University. Miriama is currently a doctoral candidate in composition at Princeton University in New Jersey, studying with Barbara White, Paul Lansky, Perry Cook, Steven Mackey and Dan Trueman. She studies the body and its resident voice with Marcy Lindheimer in New York City.  Miriama's music (\"Iron Tongues\") is recorded on Strike's album New Zealand Percussion Music (awarded \"Classical Album of the Year 2000\") and electronic work \"Speak Volumes\" is heard on the CD New Zealand Sonic Art 2000. \"Snapdragon\" is recorded on the album \"Chamber Music II\" and published in manuscript form by Waiteata Music Press (2005).  Recent work explored the nexus where oral histories, music and radio collide, culminating in the radio documentary \"The Prime Cut\". The documentary wove together selections of interviews with people who had a personal association with the Meatpacking District in New York, and revealed the changing fabric of the area. The show aired on Radio New Zealand, \"The Next Big Thing Show\" on New York Public Radio (NPR), and Resonance FM in London.  Since then, Miriama has worked with instrumental groups including the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, the Yesaroun' Duo, and Proteus Ensemble with singer Melissa Madden-Gray, the Nash Ensemble, Strike Percussion, Stroma, Timetable Percussion, So Percussion. In July 2003 Miriama attended the Bang on a Can Summer Institute at MassMoca, during which \"Snapdragon\" was performed.  In 2003 Miriama collaborated with dancer and choreographer Sara Baird (Anemone Dance Theater) in the interactive real-time performance of \"Titlipur\". The piece used samples of the bird song of Tui that Miriama recorded at Tasman Bay in Nelson, New Zealand. In performance, Sara danced the music of birdsong, and the Tui's song in turn became the music to which she danced. Titlipur featured at the Puffin Room, NYC in May 2004, at the Australasian Computer Music Conference in Wellington, New Zealand in July 2004, and as an installation at Gallery 138 in Chelsea, NYC in February 2005.   Miriama was twice awarded First Prize in the Victoria University Composers' Competition for works that fuse electroacoustic music with live materials: \"Caul\" for clarinet and tape (1997), and \"Like Two Balls of Liquid Silver Pedalling the Sky\" for baritone saxophone and tape (1998). In July and August 2004 Miriama took up a residencies at Yaddo artist colony in Saratoga Springs, New York and at The MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire.  Miriama is currently working on her debut album, and completing her doctorate work: a dissertation on the voice and technology, a radiophonic sound piece with poet Cathy Bowman, a new work for New Millennium Ensemble, and a solo interactive piece for her voice.

One of these, the 'Avengers', was extremely successful in New Zealand with recordings in the Top Ten on several occasions.  On retiring from this group he concentrated on writing musicals. First came 'Jenifer', a Rock Musical that had a successful season at Wellington's St James theatre and then 'Valdramar', a full scale fantasy Rock Opera that ran for 6 weeks at Downstage theatre to 80% audiences. His other works include a childrens� pantomime which was scheduled as a Christmas day television special.  During and after this period he worked as a television director of music and talk shows. He then left television to study composition, attending the Grove School of Music in Los Angeles. Here he studied jazz harmony and many different styles of orchestration. Each week he wrote a musical arrangement that was performed by a 'Big Band' and orchestra.  On returning to NZ, he became 'house arranger' for the Rodger Fox Band, before embarking on a career writing television commercials and themes such as the TV1 logo, the 'News' theme and numerous documentaries and specials.   One such commission was to compose a classical piece for 'Tu Fa'atasi,' a Polynesian concert in the Festival of the Arts in Wellington. Another was for the opening of the Aotea Centre in Auckland at the request of Kiri Te Kanawa.

  profile: "Currently based in Shanghai, China since 2004, Fritha's musical background can be best described as \"eclectic\". Early exposure to electronic synthesized sound, classical piano training, and a short stint as an organ scholar at the Christ Church cathedral in Nelson, New Zealand, provided a unique opportunity to develop as a composer of a variety of music.  Further composition training at both Canterbury and Victoria Universities meant a period of time focussed on post-tonal and psychological aspects of music creation and performance balanced with a strong interest in early western music and instruments.   Her latest foray in music has brought her to China where she has incorporated traditional and non-traditional features of Chinese music making into her works. Additional online training via the Berklee College of Music (Boston, USA) has strengthened her interest in electronic sound synthesis.  Fritha's next lot of projects hope to include more performance and staging elements that incorporate her growing awareness and understanding of 'world-music', electronic sonic art and aspects of early music.

  profile_other: "FRITHA JAMESON Fritha Jameson was born in Oamaru, New Zealand in 1974, and in 1978 moved to Nelson.  There she was formally taught the piano from the age of 6, and violin between the ages of 8 and 13 years.  She started competing in the Nelson Provincial Music Competitions on a yearly basis from 1982, and consistently scored highly at the piano � especially in Baroque and 20th Century Music classes.    In 1991 Fritha was the Christ Church Cathedral Assistant Organ scholar, with Douglas Mews training her in the basics of the pipe organ.  In this same year she was chosen to play with the New Zealand Secondary Schools Symphony Orchestra in Christchurch, and achieved Grade 8 with distinction at the piano.  In 1993 Fritha spent her first year of University at Canterbury in Christchurch with Chris Cree-Brown.  Her Major being in Composition after a failed performance piano audition.  During 1993, Fritha was awarded 2nd equal (no first placing) in the Canterbury University Composers Competition with Synthetic Tapestry II, and 1st place in the Nelson Provincial Music Competition (Composition Class) with the solo piano work Just a Bit of an Itch.  Also during 1993 Fritha was funded to attend the first Musicwomen Aotearoa Music Festival held in Wellington, and attended the Nelson Composers Workshop for the first time with the unaccompanied choral work The Gift of Friendship.  This is considered to be her first work.    In 1994 Fritha transferred to the Victoria University of Wellington and studied with Jack Body and John Psathas.  Synthetic Tapestry (for two flute) was broadcast on Concert FM during this same year, and she was also a finalist in the Victoria University Composers Competition with Otulls scored for violin and cello.  Over the next two years Fritha returned to Nelson and completed a certificate in Tourism and Travel, learnt the basics of the cello, worked as a sales representative and designer of curtain tracks, and wrote flock for the Dunedin Symphonia�s call for scores to be workshopped.  It was not accepted due to limited rehearsal times.  In 1997 Fritha returned to Victoria University of Wellington  to complete her Bachelor of Music.  This time she studied with Ross Harris who introduced her to Jenny Mcleod�s \"Tone Clock Theory\" and 12 tone theory (among many other techniques).  In this same year Fritha received a Highly Commended for Reflections on Going South (scored for piano and soprano) in the annual Victoria University of Wellington  Composers Competition.  Also included in her composition folio were 3 Studies for Piano, and Here for the New Zealand String Quartet�s 1997 read-through workshop.  During 1997, Fritha also studied Romantic, Renaissance and Medieval music and discovered a joy for research and analysis.  The following year (1998) brought a new awareness to Fritha�s musical style, with Honours papers including Schenkarian Analysis, Composition, Orchestration and Arrangement, and a study of Alban Berg (with particular reference to post-Romantic harmonies). During this year Heurism (scored for three flute) was completed, and has subsequently been broadcast on Concert FM, performed at the 1999 Flute Convention in Wanganui, and the 1999 Musicwomen Aotearoa�s Music Festival.  Dance Two of Phillip Dadson�s Sister�s Dance was also orchestrated in this year.  Near the end of 1998 various flatmates introduced Fritha to the sounds of the New Complexity school (Ferneyhough, Dillon�), and French Spectralist School (Murail, Saariaho�).  In 1999 Fritha was asked to tutor 2nd year composition students at the University of Victoria.  She took the opportunity to turn the five lectures into a mini-series discussing the Acoustic Synthesis of Sound, which included looking at composition from a more holistic viewpoint, and capturing (un)natural sounds using conventional western instruments.  This series was repeated in 2000.  To Fly was commissioned in this same year by her partner, the violist Malcolm Mawhinney.  After exploring overseas study opportunities, Fritha decided to train at the Wellington College of Education in Secondary Education majoring in Music and Performing Arts.  Near the end of this same year (2000) the music publishing business \"Montbretia Press\" was set up mainly as a formal archive for her scores.  At this same time a duet was commissioned for the Viola Duet \"Resonance\" to be premiered at the 29th International Viola Congress, and the incomplete orchestral work Ganymede was selected for inclusion in the Auckland Philharmonia�s composer read-through.  So far in 2001, Fritha completed Oblique in time for the Viola Congress where it was premiered with to fly; is in the process of reworking Ganymede for an international orchestral competition; and is working on plans for a work for a South Island provincial orchestra.  3 Studies for Piano has also been included in the repertoire of Dr. James Gibson (U.S.) and a New Zealand performance is expected in September 2001. Fritha is currently a full-time beginning teacher at Wellington College teaching Music, Computing and Social Studies and takes the weekly Concert Band.    --- South Island-born Fritha Jameson spent her first musical years in the city of Nelson with its easily accessible natural environment. After many years of training as a pianist, the opportunity arose to study at the University of Canterbury. An unsuccessful audition proved to be the deciding factor in her new direction as a composer in 1993, a year which saw Jameson share top equal placing in the University of Canterbury Composers' Competition.  The next year she transferred her studies and life to the Victoria University of Wellington to complete a First Class Honours degree in composition under the supervision of Jack Body, John Psathas, John Young and Ross Harris.   Her teaching experience includes tutoring in composition at Victoria University, and she taught Junior and Senior Music, Senior Computing and Junior Social Studies for two years at Wellington College. Jameson's output includes a variety of solo, duet and chamber works, a number of short orchestral works (including Fanfare commissioned by the Nelson Symphony Orchestra; subsequently renamed A Fan of Nelson Fare) and a selection of classical and popular orchestrations, arrangements and transcriptions.   Her music has been workshopped or performed by the Nelson Symphony Orchestra, Auckland Philharmonia, Wellington Youth Orchestra and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. Intellectually and aurally her works tend to explore the concert space; the performer's process and ability; the audience's perception; and texture and structure - a variety of processes that describe her current musical output as psycho-acoustic. ---  Currently based in Shanghai, China since 2004, Fritha's musical background can be best described as \"eclectic\".

  profile_other: "Yvette Audain (b. 1977)  Yvette spent most of her formative years in Papakura, New Zealand, benefiting greatly from its thriving culture of youth music education. A highlight of these years for Yvette was the interest and experience she gained in concert bands.  As a clarinettist, Yvette continued to participate in concert bands through her teens, as well as gaining experience as an orchestra player. She eventually decided to diversify by taking up the saxophone alongside the clarinet. A pivotal experience was her introduction to the Auckland Wind Orchestra in 1994, which in turn introduced her to other composers as well as somewhat more serious music than she had previously played in bands.  Yvette went on to complete a Bachelor of Music in composition and performance clarinet at Auckland University under the tuition of Eve de Castro Robinson, John Elmsly and Murray Khouri. During her time there, she was awarded the Bishop Junior and Senior Composition Scholarships, the Llewellyn Jones Prize in Music for Piano, and various places in the Composition Prize Concert, including first place for composition and performance in 1998. During this year, Yvette also gained second place in the Sky City Auckland Wind Orchestra Composers' Competition, with her Urban New Zealand Lullaby.  Following her time in Auckland, Yvette moved down to Wellington, where she gained a Bachelor of Music (First Class Honours) in composition and ethnomusicology from Victoria University, studying with John Psathas, Ross Harris, Jack Body and Allan Thomas. At the time of writing, she has recently submitted a folio for a Master of Music, completed under supervision of John Psathas. A worthwhile involvement at Victoria for Yvette has been the University Big Band in which she continues to play the alto saxophone. She has also studied the Sundance suling (flute) at Victoria.  Particularly rewarding composition performances during Yvette's time at Victoria have been , in 2000, As Any Spirit Free - a theatrical collaboration with dancer Kilda Northcott, and in 2001, Earthbound Wings performed by the Auckland Wind Orchestra at that year's NZCBA National Festival in Palmerston North. Other new experiences for Yvette since moving to Wellington have been involvement in free improvisation and the theatre group Roadworks.  A significant move, however, was taking up the Irish whistle at the end of 2000 - a move, which has, lead Yvette to diversify further through her involvement in the Wellington folk scene. She plays whistle and recorder in the band Bog Standards, as well as participating in local 'seisiuns.' Through this scene, Yvette is beginning to gain opportunities to perform some of her songs in the pop/folk idiom.  Currently, Yvette continues to play clarinet and saxophone in the Band of the Wellington and Hawke's Bay Regiment, one of the New Zealand Army's several bands. She has been involved in this since 2001 and it has not only given her involvement in all three of her bands, but is also starting to give her opportunities for arranging, an area in which she has always been interested. Yvette is at present a tutor of all her  instruments, both privately and at several schools in the Wellington region, and intends to incorporate this into a varied career alongside her composing and performing.

Over the past few years, Yvette has gained experience as a clarinettist, saxophonist, arranger and vocalist with two of New Zealand's military bands - part-time in the Band of the Wellington and Hawkes Bay Regiment, and full-time in the Royal New Zealand Navy Band.  Another significant career turn has been taking up the Irish whistle and picking up the recorder again - a move which has lead Yvette to diversify even further as a musician, through her involvement in the Auckland and Wellington folk scenes. She has played professional gigs with Irish bands as well as participating in seisiuns and folk festivals throughout New Zealand. Through this scene, Yvette has found several opportunities to perform her songs in the pop/folk idiom, accompanying herself on guitar.  Yvette has considerable experience as a tutor of all her instruments, as well as composition. She continues her involvement in this area with itinerant and out-of-hours work in the Auckland region, where she is now based again.  An especially current passion of Yvette's is vintage jazz - she plays lead alto saxophone and clarinet in Brett's New Internationals, a 1920s dance orchestra, and in 2004 joined long-running Auckland trad band The Frank E. Evans Band. She is also putting together some duos and trios, as well as continuing her involvement in the folk scene and sitting in with various bands. She continues to compose an ever-diversifying range of music, mostly tied in with and influenced by the music and instruments she plays.  --- Yvette is a freelance composer, musician (clarinet, saxophone, recorder, Irish whistle) and itinerant music tutor, who is currently based in Auckland, New Zealand.

Her album 'The Ironman' was voted \"best New Zealand Release\" on the GUNZ (Gothic Underground New Zealand) site in the annual readers poll of 2000. 2 of the tracks from the same CD were voted best and 3rd best NZ song of the year respectively.   International Reviews:   \"Dr Kevorkian and The Suicide Machine may just be making the most important sound of 2002. An enchanting patchwork of ethereal harmony, unabashed gothic melody, and a cerebral songwriting swagger, 'The Ironman' is simply stunning. A thoroughly unique work of art from start to finish. Whether by hook or crook, you MUST own this album.  RATING - 5 / 5\"-- Channel 4 (UK)   \"I'd be loath to categorize music this original. PJ Harvey springs to mind, but the style is 100% Jordan's. Her vocals are astounding\" -- The Mix (UK)   \"[The Loneliest of Creatures] is one of the best dark ambient pieces of music ever to have come out of New Zealand.� It is also, in many ways, a triumph that Reyne's previous works have been leading up to: a thoroughly emotional and moving piece of sound art which deserves wide exposure.� --  FIEND Magazine [Australia]   \"Jordan Reyne... she's shrewd, has a history and keeps on going, with a weird mind and stories that evoke photographic snapshots.� This music has beauty, but there's a trace of canker now and then, a lament where the sounds help create and distort the mood. The reason it can be enchanting is because of the impeccably measured vocals that have a delightful timbre of mischief.� Musically it's always moody to one degree with the guitar and percussive slant of �Measurement' being particularly anxious, �Part II' set in a station with tannoy announcements and clunky footfalls being picturesque, but �Not Because' ends with fluttering mayhem and what I find weird is how the songs are just one step away from sleek, gorgeous mainstream accessibility! [The Ironman] is a beautiful, perverse album, which will reap further rewards the more you allow it to.\" -- Mick Mercer (UK)   \"Husky and thoughtful female vocals ride over a wide-ranging alternative spectrum of sound, from rock and acoustic guitars, to mellow and haunting synths.� That said, this sound is distinct, with Jordan's vocals being able to reach any scale, no matter what the music around her may be doing, making for a varied listening experience.� This is what the scene needs � more bands willing to give something new a go, and Dr Kevorkian seem to be amongst those leading the way\" -- Hard Wired (UK)   Biography provided by the artist and current to 2005  "

  profile: "Born 1929, Ian arrived in New Zealand from Scotland in 1974 with his wife and family. Although an architect by profession, Ian has been involved in the promotion and performance of serious music over many years in both Scotland and New Zealand.  Further to commencing piano tuition at age seven and clarinet tuition at age fifteen, he attended six years of part time courses in orchestral and chamber music performance at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music. These courses were directed by Horace Fellowes, the former leader of  Sir Thomas Beecham's first symphony orchestra and of the Scottish Orchestra.  Regular opportunities for public performance were provided as part of the training.  During his service in the armed forces Ian played solo clarinet with four Royal Air Force bands in various parts of Britain and eventually became conductor of one. He was also able during different periods of his service to play 1st clarinet with the St.Andrews University orchestra in Scotland and the Cardiff College of Music orchestra in Wales.   On completion of his National Service he joined the Glasgow Orchestral Society as principal clarinetist. He played in that position for fifteen years. He was on the management committee of the society during that time, president on two occasions and public relations officer for many years. The society, originally formed in 1870, was noted for performing a large part of the standard symphonic repertoire and for commissioning new works. It also undertook premiere performances of works by well known composers. These included a British premiere of an overture by Shostakovich, resulting in a letter of thanks from the composer. During this time Ian participated in recitals of chamber music. He was also a choir singer for  twenty years.   In 1975 soon after coming to New Zealand, he joined the Upper Hutt City Orchestra under conductors Alan Foster and Kenneth Young, both from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.. In addition to playing in chamber music recitals, Ian formed and conducted a small string group to play mainly Baroque music. At this time he was also involved with group teaching of the clarinet at Upper Hutt College, together with teaching that instrument to private pupils.  Some years later he suggested the formation of the Upper Hutt Youth Orchestra and acted as its secretary and treasurer together with being a wind tutor. At this time he also started playing the bassoon.  In 1989 after retiring from the then Department of Education as Regional Architect, Central Region of New  Zealand, Ian commenced to compose music. Originally this was to be used in the making of documentary films, an interest taken up several years previously. Soon however composing became an absorbing occupation and he formed a wind trio which performed some of his music at three public concerts. One was at the Lower Hutt town hall in connection with the 1990 celebrations of the settlers arriving at Petone.  The enthusiasm shown by the audience and by several individuals after the concert for  the seven movement Otari  Suite for  wind trio performed on that occasion, encouraged Ian  to continue composing.  Before moving from Wellington to Dunedin in 1991 he deputised at short notice to play 1st clarinet at a concert by the Wellington Chamber Orchestra.   In Dunedin Ian continued to compose and develop skills in programming music directly by computer. He also produced printed scores and parts by that means.  By the year 2003, fifty eight compositions were completed and fourteen of these had received public performances with one broadcast on Concert FM. His works include 5 for symphony orchestra, 1 for chamber orchestra, 5 for string orchestra, 1 piano concerto,1 concertino for clarinet & string orchestra, 2 string quartets, 11 for two clarinets & bassoon (or cello), 1 for two clarinets & two bassoons, 1 for cello & piano, 1 for flute & piano, 4 for clarinet & piano, 14 for piano, 2 suites for church organ, 1 for mixed voice choir, 1 march for brass band, 2 for saxophone quartet and 1 for rock band. Many of  Ian's compositions are dedicated to his wife and family, relatives overseas and musical friends.  For several years Ian was secretary and treasurer of the Dunedin Composers Group founded by Dr Anthony Ritchie in 1990.  He organised concerts of music by Dunedin composers often with the collaboration of the University of Otago Music Department.  These included a special concert held in the Dunedin Public Art Gallery during the Otago and Southland 1998 Sesquicentenary celebrations.  He also arranged orchestral workshops over three evenings for fourteen Dunedin composers involving the Southern Sinfonia.   In 1997, further to a need by the Composers Association of New Zealand (CANZ) for a composer to represent the lower South Island on the CANZ committee, Ian was approached and agreed to become a member. This was the first time the lower South Island had been represented since CANZ was founded in 1970.  Ian organised the first annual general meeting of the association to be held in Dunedin which was during the Otagoand Southland 1998 Sesquicentenary  celebrations. He attended committee and annual general meetings in different N.Z. centres over four years, recruited new members for CANZ and wrote Otago regional reports each year about the activities of composers and concerts of their music in the region for the year book CANZONA.            Ian has produced four compact discs which contain selections of his instrumental and orchestral music.   "

After studying at Victoria University during Professor Page's \"heady '60s\", under David Farquhar and Douglas Lilburn, Graham moved overseas and attended an international composition course led by Karlheinz Stockhausen and Henri Pousseur. The need for survival necessitated Graham's move from composition to teaching. After working as Music Specialist, Head of department, in a number of English Grammar Schools he returned to New Zealand to work in the area of teacher education specialising in particular in philosophy and sociology of music education, music composition and musical style. Along side his teaching, Graham has performed widely as a conductor of choirs and orchestras, an organist and an accompanist. More recently he has returned to music composition. Having been a community musician for so many years, it seemed only natural for him to fall into the roll of community composer, writing works to suit various local and national performing groups. The attraction to this form of composition is that the limits of the performers' technical abilities are clearly defined, and one can guarantee that the works will be performed. His 'Missa Brevis' is performed by cathedral choirs in both Auckland and Wellington, and this 'Mass of the Holy Spirit', recently published by Millennium Publications, is performed by various church congregations throughout the country. His works for recorder ensembles are performed by both amateur and professional groups and his choral music has been performed by various choral societies and has been included by schools in the Choral Federation Secondary Schools Choral Competition programmes. One of the appeals of Graham's music is its range of technical requirements and its suitability for a variety of musical occasions. (July 2007) "

  profile_other: "Emma Carle (b.1978) has spent most of her life in Wellington, but her passion for adventure has seen her cycle touring around New Zealand and trekking and travelling in India and Nepal. She was classically trained in violin and piano and studied composition with John Psathas, Jack Body, John Young and Ross Harris at Victoria University where she gained a BMus (Hons) and a BA.  She is most interested in music of non-western traditions and has a world music radio show called 'global pulse' on Radio Active in Wellington. She also co-presents a one-hour classical show there.  While studying at Victoria University she played in the Javanese Gamelan orchestra and has since been invited to write several pieces combining western and gamelan instruments, with the challenge being to overcome the different tuning systems. 'Go Go Gadget Arms', for 3 violins and Bonang (an elaborating instrument in the gamelan) was commissioned for the 'Beat' Gamelan festival in Wellington in 1999 and has been released on both the 'Beat' festival CD and in 2004, 'Open Space #16', an American CD series. 'Each of Two', for chromatic gamelan and saxophone quartet was performed in The Netherlands in 2002 by Multifoon gamelan ensemble and the Aurelia Saxophone Quartet.  She wrote several 30 second microscores when NZ contemporary music ensemble 175 East called for them in 1999, one of which was chosen for inclusion on SOUNZ's latest promotional CD of music by NZ women composers. (Broadcasters can enquire to SOUNZ for copies). Her latest work was a collaboration with Balinese composer Wayan I Yudane, written for Javanese gamelan and organ, titled 'gam.org'. It was performed at the Wellington International Fringe Festival and several other concerts around town, each time on a different organ!  Emma is also interested in film and photography and having studied electroacoustic composition in her time at University, she is keen to pursue multimedia projects combining both music and a visual element. She has already worked on creating a soundtrack to a silent film from the NZ Film archive.  --- Emma Carle (b.1978) studied composition with John Psathas, Jack Body, John Young and Ross Harris at Victoria University, Wellington, where she gained a BMus (Hons) and a BA in criminology.

She studied Composition at Victoria University of Wellington from 1985 to 1987 under the tuition of Jack Body, David Farquhar and Ross Harris, graduating with a Bmus. During her years at university she was also active as an oboist and singer; one of her first year compositions won third prize in the 1985 VUW Composers Competition; and one of her third year choral compositions, 'Wind and Rain', was performed by the VUW Chamber Choir at the 1988 Sonic Circus organised by Jack Body, and subsequently by Cantoris in 1990.  Pepe then focused on singing and teaching, travelling to Britain and Holland, 1991-1993, to further her studies of early music singing in particular. During this time she was commissioned by Helen Bowater (then Composer-in-Residence at the Nelson School of Music) to write a piece for a concert in Nelson (her home town): this work, 'In Queen Beatrix's Garden' was performed there in 1993, just before Pepe returned to New Zealand from The Hague. Upon her return to New Zealand Pepe focused mainly on performing (setting up her vocal consort Baroque Voices in 1994) and raising her first two (of three) children. It wasn't until late 1999 that she rediscovered her \"composition muse\" and began to write again with great fervour. In September 2000 the fruits of her newly found inspiration, along with several other works written between 1983 (when she was still at school) and 1992 (in Holland), were performed in a concert entitled Many Waters: a culmination of over 15 years of music writing. In 2001 Pepe wrote several other new works, including 'Introit', commissioned by the Choir of Wellington's Cathedral of St Paul and performed by them in church services in Britain and Ireland in 2002.

In 2001 Pepe wrote several other new works, including 'Introit', commissioned by the Choir of Wellington's Cathedral of St Paul and performed by them in church services in Britain and Ireland in 2002. Being a singer, Pepe has a special empathy for writing for the voice: most of her compositions include one or more voices, often 'partnered' with other melodic wind instruments and/or percussion. Most of her recent work has been for unaccompanied vocal consorts or choirs, with the exception of 'Scorpio II: From the far point of the rising of the sun...', for oboe and soprano, written for performance by Robert Orr and herself in a Baroque Voices concert in Wellington's Cathedral of St Paul in May 2005. Her most recent large-scale work, the 'Mass of the False Relation' (c.25mins long, including a previously-written 'Introit') was premiered by Baroque Voices in July 2006. Comments from newspaper reviewers, on concert performances of Pepe's works, include: \"...kaleidoscope of colours...fascinating...\" (The Dominion, 21 Sept 2000) \"...imaginative works...\" (Capital Times, June 2005) \"...an innovative concert...\" (Capital Times, June 2005) \"...the sound pictures created were ethereally lovely...\" (Capital Times, June 2005) \"...a very impressive example of, and a splendid performance of an engagingly original work.\" - referring to 'Mass of the False Relation' as the highlight of a concert (The Dominion Post, 28 July 2006) (June 2007)  "

  profile: "Susan Beresford (Susan Platts Mills) was born in Karori, Wellington in 1935.  Her mother, Majorie Fitzherbert Mills, who died when Susan and her three siblings were small children, had been a gifted pianist and so all the children were given piano lessons as a matter of course.  At the age of nearly 8, Susan was sent as a boarder to New Zealand Friends School in Wanganui for six years where her piano teachers included Francis Anderson and Helen Young.  In 1949 she started at the local high school in Palmerston North and continued piano with Violet Bowick, Mr Gunther (her mother's teacher) then when he became too old and ill, May Chipperfield.  In 1952, aged 17, Susan became a piano teacher at her boarding school in Wanganui.  But after a year there decided to move to Wellington to further her own piano studies with L D Austin, a well-known pianist and music critic, and harmony wiht  Charles Martin, a Wellington organist.  It was while she was in Wellington and through L D Austin that Susan was brouht to the notice of Fernando Laires, the visiting Portuguese pianist (and at 26 the youngest-ever Professor of the Lisbon Conservatorio of Music) who suggested that she audition in Lisbon for a scholarship from the Portuguese government to study with him at the Conservatorio.  Which in due course (once she had fulfilled her father's requirements of first learning shorthand-typing (just in case!) and earning the fare for the month-long boat trip to Europe) she did.  The audition at the Conservatorio was successful and Susan spent the next three years studying piano (with Fernando Laires), composition, harmony, and counterpoint (with Artur Santos), history of music (in Portuguese, of course), choral singing, and Portuguese literature.  On giving the required 3rd-year piano recital and passing all the final exams, Susan returned home in 1957 to New Zealand and her much-missed father and family.  Although she had played on Radio Portuguesa and given a recital in Wanganui soon after her arrival home, nobody could say her career as a pianist was either launched or assured.  Both L D Austin and Charles Martin were by now dead, so, armed only with a diploma from a foreign country little recognised here, Susan set about earning her living by teaching once again.  By 1960 her Portuguese diploma, having been authenticated, validated and thoroughly checked out by the Registration Board, she became a Registered Music Teacher.  Susan married Rene Beresford in 1961 and, with the birth of their first child (Marjorie) in 1963 and five more in the following nine years, pupil numbers were necessarily reduced for a few years.  By 1981, however, Susan decided to revitalise her musical life as a counter-balance to a busy home life and so did three years full-time at Victoria University to obtain \"a dinkum Kiwi B.Mus.\".  The highlight of those three years in retrospect, for Susan, was 2nd-year Composition with David Farquhar whose compositional skills she greatly admires.  Sadly, in 1985, Susan's husband of 24 years opted for solitude over noisy togetherness and departed for Australia.  Susan and her three younger children moved to Hawkes Bay where she was offered a position as piano teacher at Iona College where she taught for the next eleven years as well as teaching at home and raising children.  Finally, in 1996, she returned to the Wellington area to buy a big old house together with her eldest and youngest daughter to enjoy her daugters' six children together, and start a new batch of pupils which by now of course included the grandchildren.  Through all these many years of piano teaching, Susan has enjoyed composing purpose-specific music for her pupils, children and grandchildren, and looks likely to continue that way 'till a ripe old age!    (October 2005)"

Her musical output reflects her wider interest in the Arts, having trained in drama and dance from an early age.  Her passion for composition lies in the collaboration with other artists - particularly in the area of film, dance and theatre. (March 2006)  --- Claire was born in Auckland in 1983.
